        "title": "Pope's comments on Trump's Christianity spark jokes on Twitter",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Pope Francis\u2019s remarks on Thursday that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is \u201cnot Christian\u201d due to his views on immigration sparked jokes on social media, and the pope quickly trended on Twitter in the United States. The businessman and former reality TV star called the pope\u2019s comments \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and said he was proud to be a Christian. Twitter users poked fun at the brouhaha. \u201cWatching Trump fight with the Pope might be the most fun you can have with your clothes on,\u201d tweeted actor Albert Brooks (@AlbertBrooks). Television comedy writer Wendy Molyneux (@WendyMolyneux) joked about the controversy by attributing a fake quotation to Trump that mocked the presidential candidate\u2019s penchant for bawdy exaggeration. \u201c\u2018You know, a lot of my friends are Popes, and they love what I\u2019m doing. This one Pope is such a loser. And fat.\u2019 - @realDonaldTrump,\u201d Molyneux wrote Thursday. Paul Begala (@PaulBegala), a political consultant who is an adviser to a Super PAC helping Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, said: \u201cHow long before realDonaldTrump says the Pope is totally broke. Doesn\u2019t own a single golf course. Never even dated a supermodel. #Loser.\u201d \u201cHow dare the pope be concerned with the poor & disenfranchised! I mean Jesus never was!\u201d tweeted actor Rainn Wilson (@rainnwilson). \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d hosted by comedian Stephen Colbert, tweeted a poll Thursday in which it asked \u201cHow can Donald Trump get back in the Pope\u2019s good graces?\u201d The options listed were \u201cCabinet position,\u201d \u201cPurchase indulgences,\u201d \u201cEvict Protestants\u201d and \u201cSensual back rub.\u201d Trump, long the leader in national opinion polls, and five Republican rivals face off on Saturday in South Carolina\u2019s primary. While the pope and Trump are now at odds, the real estate developer had previously praised the pontiff. In 2013, the year Francis began his papacy, Trump compared himself to the pope favorably. On Christmas Day 2013: Trump tweeted, \u201cThe new Pope is a humble man, very much like me, which probably explains why I like him so much!\u201d  The pope was not the only powerful figure to run afoul of the Republican candidate on Thursday. Media titan Rupert Murdoch weighed in on Twitter to contest Trump\u2019s claims that Fox News is biased against him after a national poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal showed Senator Ted Cruz inching ahead of Trump. \u201cTrump blames me for WSJ poll, fights FoxNews,\u201d tweeted Murdoch (@rupertmurdoch), executive chairman of both Fox News parent 21st Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O)  and Journal owner News Corp (NWSA.O). \u201cTime to calm down. If I running anti-Trump conspiracy then doing lousy job!\u201d  For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, \u201cTales from the Trail\u201d (here). ",

        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - South Sudan s hellish war will get worse if its neighbors let President Salva Kiir hold an election before he accepts peacekeepers, a ceasefire and political opposition, U.N. investigators said on Wednesday. South Sudan was plunged into civil war in 2013 when Kiir fell out with his deputy, Riek Machar. Since then 50,000-300,000 people have died, according to the African Union (AU), and millions have been displaced or pushed to the brink of famine.  It s just a story of absolutely unimaginable cruelty,  Yasmin Sooka, head of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, told a news conference in Geneva.  Last year Machar fled, but during his retreat Kiir s forces sparked a new conflict in the Equatorias region, boosting opposition to Kiir s Dinka tribe, which almost one in four South Sudanese belong to. Kiir s mandate expires in April, and he has made clear he wants a new election, which would be catastrophic, Sooka and her fellow commissioner Godfrey Musila said.   You will not have a democratic Dinka president elected,  Musila said.  If the Dinka are to stay in power they will have to do that militarily. It has to be a police state.  Outside powers must urgently find a way to generate a legitimate government, he said. The first task was to fully deploy a 4,000-strong regional protection force that Kiir and East African bloc IGAD agreed on a year ago. Although limited to the capital, Juba, the force would create conditions for the opposition to return and would free up U.N. peacekeepers to go further afield, helping to bring about a ceasefire, which the opposition, with no military supply lines, would accept, Musila said.  Only 400 of the force have arrived so far. Sooka said the best tool to get action was the  hybrid court  that the AU and South Sudan agreed to set up, based on a mix of their laws, to prosecute suspects including top political and military figures. Sooka has an  almost prosecutorial mandate  from the U.N. Human Rights Council and plans to have a team of 16 on the ground this week, including forensic analysts and military advisers. On Monday, South Sudan Justice Minister Paulino Wanawilla Unango told the Council that the government was still incorporating last year s agreement with IGAD.  Sooka said the AU must ensure consequences if the government failed to take the necessary steps, as it did in Gambia in January, when it intervened to oust president Yahya Jammeh.   The West Africans camped outside of Gambia and told the president if you don t go, our armies will come in,  she said.  But will the East African community or IGAD do that?  ",

        "title": "Congress to probe Juniper 'back door' exposure, possible U.S. involvement",
        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional probe into the impact of a hack of Juniper Networks Inc software will examine the possibility that it was initially altered at the behest of the National Security Agency, a lawmaker said in an interview on Thursday. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform this month sent letters asking some two dozen agencies to provide documents showing whether they used Juniper devices running ScreenOS software. The company said in December ScreenOS had been compromised by hackers using a so-called back door in the software. Rep. Will Hurd, a Texas Republican who heads the committee\u2019s technology subcommittee and formerly worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, said his initial goal in pursuing the probe was to determine whether government agencies, many of which use Juniper gear, had been compromised by the hackers. But Hurd, a key player in the investigation, said the committee would also probe the origins of the breach. If it turns out that a back door was included at a U.S. government agency\u2019s request, he said, that should help change the policy debate. The earliest Juniper back door identified by researchers used a technique widely attributed to the NSA.\u00a0 The NSA did not respond to a request for comment. Juniper declined to comment.  U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have long lobbied in vain for legislation that would require technology companies to provide back doors in equipment that use encryption technology. They say they need such access to conduct authorized wiretaps and other types or surveillance. The technology industry has fiercely opposed any such  policy, arguing that back doors could be exploited by criminals or foreign intelligence services. The debate has heated up in the wake of recent attacks by Islamic militants, who make heavy use of digital communications networks. \u201cHow do we understand the vulnerabilities that created this problem and ensure this kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen in the future?\u201d Hurd said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government should be requesting anything that weakens the security of anything that is used by the federal government or American businesses.\u201d Juniper said in December it had found two unauthorized pieces of code inserted into ScreenOS that would have allowed whoever planted them to read email sent over supposedly secure connections known as virtual private networks, or VPNs.  After outside researchers picked apart the software patches Juniper issued to fix the problem, they concluded that one back door had been inserted in 2014 and one in 2012. The 2012 version, though, merely changed the formulation of a piece of software known as a random number generator, which is part of most encryption products. The random number generator used in the Juniper products, known as Dual Elliptic Curve, has long been suspected by security professionals of containing a back door engineered by the U.S. National Security Agency. Those suspicions were largely confirmed by leaks from former agency contractor Edward Snowden. Juniper said this month it would remove Dual Elliptic Curve entirely in future versions of its products. Juniper has not said how the code got there in the first place. It sells into defense and intelligence agencies, however, and major customers could have requested that the code be modified as part of a contract, former employees told Reuters this month. That is how Dual Elliptic Curve made it into a software kit distributed by security company RSA. The NSA is a logical suspect for the 2008 code insertion, said security researcher Nicholas Weaver of the International Computer Science Institute, while the offenders in both 2012 and 2014 are more likely to have been other countries.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two major U.S. rules aimed at curbing corruption and pollution in the energy sector may be entirely wiped from the books by next week, after the Republican-led House of Representatives on Wednesday voted to repeal them. The Senate is expected to take up repealing the rules, both of which were years in the making, as soon as Thursday. Under the virtually untested Congressional Review Act, the Republican-led Congress can vote to permanently undo newly minted regulations. Agencies cannot revisit overturned regulations and timing in the law means any regulation enacted in the Obama administration\u2019s final months are eligible for axing. Required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s \u201cextraction rule\u201d was approved this summer to require companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp to publicly state the taxes and other fees they pay to governments.  Exxon, and other major energy corporations, fought for years to keep the rule from seeing the light of day. After a series of legal battles the SEC in June 2016 finally completed the rule, which supporters say can help expose questionable financial ties U.S. companies may have with foreign governments. During Wednesday\u2019s debate, Representative Maxine Waters, the senior Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, raised concerns that Exxon\u2019s CEO during those fights was Rex Tillerson, just confirmed in the top diplomatic post of Secretary of State. During Tillerson\u2019s confirmation hearings, he raised Democrats\u2019 hackles by saying he did not know Exxon lobbied against U.S. sanctions on Russia, where he did business for years. Republicans say the rule is burdensome and costly for energy companies, and also duplicates other long-standing regulations. On the House floor Republican Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, called the rule part of \u201ca radical leftist elitist agenda against carbon-based jobs.\u201d The stream buffer rule is intended to lessen the amount of waste from mountain-top removal coal mining deposited in local waterways.  Republican lawmakers, though, say it is hurting coal jobs by placing unworkable limits on the industry. Democrats, on the other hand, say it cuts down on water pollution. Republicans consider loosening regulation as high a priority as dismantling the Affordable Care Act and rewriting the tax code, according to Kevin McCarthy, the second most powerful Republican in the House. On Thursday, the House will vote on repealing three other rules - on methane on public lands, expanding background checks for some gun purchases, and requiring federal contractors to post information on their workers. In recent weeks, the House has also passed bills to slow down regulatory processes and President Donald Trump, a fellow Republican, has issued executive orders trying to shrink the government bureaucracy.

        "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday the State Department\u2019s current spending was \u201cnot sustainable,\u201d and he willingly accepted the \u201cchallenge\u201d President Donald Trump had given in proposing to cut more than a quarter of his agency\u2019s budget. Trump\u2019s budget proposal for the fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1 would cut 28 percent of the budget for U.S. diplomacy and foreign aid, according to documents provided by the White House. The combined budget for the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) would be $25.6 billion. Speaking in Tokyo at the start of a trip to Asia focused on the threat from North Korea, Tillerson defended the cuts as a necessary correction to a \u201chistorically high\u201d budget that had grown to address conflicts abroad in which the United States was engaged, as well as disaster aid. \u201cClearly the level of spending that the State Department has been undertaking, particularly in this past year, is simply not sustainable,\u201d he said. \u201cAs time goes by, there will be fewer military conflicts that the U.S. will be directly engaged in.\u201d The United States will also reduce spending by attracting funds from other countries and \u201cother sources\u201d to contribute to development aid and disaster assistance, Tillerson said. Trump\u2019s budget would preserve $3.1 billion in security aid to Israel but reduce funding for the United Nations, climate change and cultural exchange programs. For a graphic on winners and losers in Trump's budget, click here: here Congress, which rules on the government\u2019s purse strings and is controlled by Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, may reject some or many of the cuts to the State and USAID budgets, which pay for everything from maintaining America\u2019s diplomatic corps to fighting poverty, promoting human rights and improving health in foreign nations. More than 120 retired U.S. generals and admirals urged Congress in a letter last month to fully fund diplomacy and foreign aid, arguing the functions were \u201ccritical to keeping America safe.\u201d Several Republicans in Congress have expressed opposition to Trump\u2019s plans to slash funding for diplomacy and foreign aid. Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate subcommittee responsible for those budgets, said last month the proposal would be \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in Congress.  Tillerson said there would be a \u201ccomprehensive examination\u201d of how the State Department\u2019s programs are executed and how the department is structured. He said the situation was challenging, but that he took on the challenge that Trump had given him \u201cwillingly.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m confident that with the input of the men and women of the State Department we are going to construct a way forward that allows us to be much more effective, much more efficient and be able to do a lot with fewer dollars,\u201d he said.

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Corruption charges against a union leader and a financier\u00a0stemming from state and federal investigations that include an examination of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s campaign fundraising practices are casting a cloud over his office and could possibly complicate his re-election bid. The arrests on Wednesday of the head of New York City\u2019s prison guard union and a hedge fund financier accused of orchestrating a bribery scheme involving union retirement and operating funds were the first to emerge from the probes. Although the charges were not linked to de Blasio, who won a landslide victory in 2013, the case is the first major prosecution to emerge from several overlapping state and federal corruption probes examining de Blasio\u2019s fundraising practices, among other avenues of inquiry.  David Birdsell, dean of the Baruch College School of Public Affairs, said on Wednesday the investigations were \u201ckeeping him off message,\u201d noting that de Blasio was on occasion having to avoid the press because of incessant questions. On Wednesday his office said the investigations were not distracting the mayor. \u201cNew Yorkers will vote for the candidate who gets things done for their families and communities,\u201d said Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for de Blasio. \u201cThat person is Mayor de Blasio.\u201d Still, there is evidence that the investigations are affecting the mayor\u2019s standing, Birdsell said.  If they drag on and raise more questions they will not only be a distraction for the mayor but possibly encourage a challenge from his own party.  \u201cRight now people smell some blood in the water,\u201d Birdsell said. He said if the mayor becomes directly implicated in the investigations it would turn a contested Democratic primary mayoral race next year into a certainty from a likelihood. On Wednesday at a public appearance, de Blasio reiterated that he was \u201cabsolutely comfortable that we have done things properly.\u201d He has said his administration committed no wrongdoing and is cooperating fully with investigators. In April, de Blasio\u2019s office received subpoenas from state and federal prosecutors pursuing coordinated corruption probes that extended from City Hall to the police department. News of the subpoenas came days after a leaked January report from the state Board of Elections accusing the mayor and others of intentionally evading campaign finance contribution limits in 2014. The mayor\u2019s counsel said at the time de Blasio had not been personally served. The once popular de Blasio, who struck a cord with New Yorkers after 12 years of Michael Bloomberg\u2019s mayoralty, has seen his approval rating fall to a new low in May, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.  De Blasio will be up for re-election in 2017. The latest poll, conducted in the first week of June among 600 likely Democratic mayoral primary voters and published on Wednesday, showed 38 percent believed de Blasio deserved reelection while 43 percent said he did not.\u00a0  The poll was conducted by NYC Deserves Better, a group formed by Bradley Tusk, a businessman and former campaign manager for Michael Bloomberg who wants a new mayor to be elected. The poll found that in a potential match up, de Blasio was neck-and-neck with City Comptroller Scott Stringer.\u00a0\u00a0  However, the poll also found that 51 percent had a \u2018very positive\u2019 or \u2018somewhat positive\u2019 opinion of the mayor, and 32 percent had a \u2018somewhat negative\u2019 or \u2018very negative\u2019 opinion. De Blasio brushed off questions about the poll and said he was committed to focusing on the job.  \u201cPolls come and go. They go up. They go down. They don\u2019t always reflect what happens in elections,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe fundamentally that the goal is to do the work, do it well ",

        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala s attorney general and a United Nations-backed anti-corruption body will investigate the nation s political parties on suspicion of illegal campaign financing during the 2015 presidential election campaign, the groups said on Thursday.  We have agreed with the attorney general to initiate an investigation into the electoral campaigns of all political parties in the 2015 cycle,  said Ivan Velasquez, head of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). The CICIG has become a thorn in the side of Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales since it kicked off a graft probe focused on his elder brother and one of the president s sons. In 2015, the CICIG was instrumental in removing Morales  predecessor Otto Perez from office after identifying him as a key player in an alleged multimillion-dollar corruption racket. Perez is now in prison on trial with his former vice-president. Morales, a former comedian who won office in 2015 on a pledge to fight corruption, is scheduled to meet tomorrow with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres in New York. Two government officials told Reuters on Wednesday Morales plans to ask Guterres to replace Velasquez, a Colombian whose tenure as CICIG chief is set to run out in 2019. A Guatemalan government spokesman declined to say whether Morales would seek Velasquez s removal, but did state that the president would discuss improving the CICIG with Guterres, and also propose a new model for combating crime.

        "title": "U.S. senators reach bipartisan deal on Obamacare, Trump indicates support",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators on Tuesday reached a bipartisan agreement to shore up Obamacare for two years by reviving federal subsidies for health insurers that President Donald Trump planned to scrap, and the president indicated his support for the plan. The deal worked out by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray would meet some Democratic objectives, including reviving the subsidies for Obamacare and restoring $106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans. In exchange, Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage. The Trump administration said last week it would stop paying billions of dollars to insurers to help lower-income Americans pay medical expenses, part of the Republican president\u2019s effort to dismantle Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law. The subsidies to private insurers cost the government an estimated $7 billion this year and were forecast at $10 billion for 2018. Trump\u2019s move to scuttle them had raised concerns about chaos in insurance markets. Trump hoped to make good on his campaign promise to dismantle the law when he took office in January, with Republicans, who pledged for seven years to scrap it, controlling Congress. But he has been frustrated with their failure to pass legislation to repeal and replace it. Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, extended health insurance coverage to 20 million Americans. Republicans say it is ineffective and a massive government intrusion in a key sector of the economy. The Alexander-Murray plan could keep Obamacare in place at least until the 2020 presidential campaign starts heating up. \u201cThis takes care of the next two years. After that, we can have a full-fledged debate on where we go long-term on healthcare,\u201d Alexander said of the deal. It is unclear whether the agreement can make it through Congress. Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, said it had \u201cbroad support\u201d among senators in his party, but it was harder to gauge possible support among Republicans.  Moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins, who helped sink earlier Obamacare repeal legislation, voiced backing for the new plan, but conservative Republicans may be less welcoming. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, threw his weight behind the effort. In an interview with Reuters, Sanders said Alexander was a \u201cwell-respected figure\u201d known for bipartisanship and that the Tennessee senator\u2019s reputation would help propel the legislation through the Senate. The willingness of Sanders, a liberal champion, to offer his support of a deal with Republicans that could allow states to change some Obamacare requirements provided a boost to the Alexander-Murray effort. \u201cWe are going to overturn what Trump is trying to do,\u201d Sanders said. Schumer urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring the plan to a vote on the Senate floor and urged the House of Representatives to take it up then as quickly as possible so Trump can sign it. TRUMP STILL SEEKS LONG-TERM SOLUTION Trump, during comments at the White House, suggested he could get behind the Alexander-Murray plan as a short-term solution. In remarks later at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, Trump commended the work by Alexander and Murray, but said: \u201cI continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies.\u201d Trump said earlier he wanted lawmakers, once they completed a major tax reform effort, to again take up broader legislation that failed in the Senate last month that would divvy up federal healthcare money as block grants to states. Murray is the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and Alexander is its chairman. She said the two were able to find common ground on the steps aimed at stabilizing the insurance markets created under Obamacare and to \u201chelp protect families from premium spikes as a result of the sabotage we have seen from this administration.\u201d According to a document seen by Reuters, the plan would make it easier for states to get waivers approved that would allow them to offer cheaper healthcare plans, including catastrophic health plans, which cover a limited set of benefits and are currently only available to those under 30. Shares of U.S. hospital operators, including Tenet Healthcare Corp and HCA Healthcare Inc, moved higher after news of the deal. Tenet shares closed 5.3 percent higher, while HCA rose 2.2 percent. Shares of some U.S. health insurers also extended their gains on the day, with Anthem Inc finishing up 1.9 percent and Centene Corp gaining 3.2 percent. Analyst Brian Tanquilut of global investment banking firm Jefferies, who focuses on hospital companies, said that if the deal is passed in Congress, it should stabilize the Obamacare insurance exchanges and improve their viability. \u201cHospitals will avoid a potential spike in bad debt and charity care next year,\u201d Tanquilut said. \u201cThis is obviously a good step. It\u2019s bipartisan and guaranteed for two years.\u201d     ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional panel next month will hold a hearing on violent extremism, including threats from domestic militants, following a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that turned deadly. The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee, Republican Michael McCaul, announced the Sept. 12 hearing in a letter to the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Bennie Thompson. The committee holds a hearing once a year, around the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, to discuss worldwide threats. A committee aide said the Charlottesville protests had  prompted the decision to broaden the hearing to include threats from domestic militants. But Thompson said the move was \u201cnot adequate or appropriate\u201d to address his request for a hearing on threats from white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups. \u201cThe September 12 hearing to cover worldwide threats is an annual hearing that was already scheduled prior to the domestic attacks this weekend,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt will not allow us to go into the depth necessary to address the far-ranging and multifaceted aspects of the threat posed by domestic terrorist threats from white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups.\u201d The Homeland Security Committee will invite leaders of the Homeland Security Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Counterterrorism Center, McCaul said. \u201cWe must stand together and reject racism, bigotry, and prejudice, including the hateful ideologies promoted by neo-Nazis, the KKK, and all other white supremacy groups,\u201d McCaul wrote in his response to Democrats\u2019 request for a hearing. A 32-year-old woman was killed on Saturday in Charlottesville when a car plowed into a rival protest to white supremacist demonstrators. A 20-year-old Ohio man said to have harbored Nazi sympathies has been charged with murder.  President Donald Trump on Tuesday said both sides were to blame for the violence, drawing condemnation from both fellow Republicans and Democrats for failing to single out the white nationalists. ",

        "title": "Catalan leader Puigdemont set to call regional election",
        "text": "BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan president Carles Puigdemont is set to call a snap regional election, political allies said, a move that could help break a one-month deadlock between the Madrid government and separatists seeking a split from Spain. The uncertainty remained high however as Puigdemont who had announced he would deliver an address at 1.30 p.m. (1130 GMT), first delayed it by one hour and then canceled it, triggering speculation he could still change his mind. Several members of his pro-independence coalition said he would dissolve the regional parliament and call the vote. The regional broadcaster said he would deliver a speech in the assembly at 5 p.m., as had initially been planned.  Barcelona-based La Vanguardia said he would call the vote for Dec. 20 and was taking the decision in a bid to persuade the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy not to enforce direct rule in the region, which he might do as soon as Friday. The Catalan secessionist drive is Spain s worst political crisis since the military dictatorship of Francisco Franco ended in 1975. It has fractured society and hundreds of companies have left the region. It is also the most serious challenge to the integrity of a Western European country since an independence referendum in Scotland in 2014, when voters in the end chose to stay part of the United Kingdom. European leaders fear it could spur secessionist ambitions in other parts of the continent. But cracks appeared late on Wednesday in the independence coalition as some members backed an election while others said there was no alternative to independence. Within minutes of Thursday s developments, several pro-secession lawmakers and mayors announced they were stepping down.  I don t share the decision to call an election. I am resigning as a lawmaker and a member of PdeCat (Puigdemont s Catalan Democratic Party),  said Jordi Cuminal on Twitter. Several hundred people also took to the streets and gathered on Placa Sant Jaume, in front of the Catalan government s headquarters in central Barcelona.  Puigdemont traitor,  a big banner read. Far-left party CUP, a key support for Puigdemont s minority government, said it would oppose a vote.  Until now, pro-independence supporters had one problem: the Spanish state. If elections are called, they will have two,  it said on twitter. Demand for Spanish debt and shares jumped when it emerged Puigdemont could call an election. Spain s 10-year government bond yield - which moves inversely to price - fell 6 basis points to 1.58 percent on the news. The stock index IBEX rose 1.9 percent to a four-week high.  This news is positive for Spain because it looks like Puigdemont is looking for ways other than declaring independence,  said ING strategist Martin van Vliet.  It sounds like he is calling these elections so that Madrid does not have to invoke article 155,  that would allow central government to suspend the wealthy region s autonomy. It is not yet clear whether Rajoy will impose direct rule as planned or simply seek the Senate s authorisation to do so but stop short of making it effective. His government said earlier this week that calling a snap election would not be enough, and Puigdemont would also have to withdraw an ambiguous declaration of independence he made on Oct. 10. An election could either strengthen Puigdemont s mandate if pro-independence parties won, or allow him a graceful exit if they did not. An opinion poll published by the El Periodico newspaper on Sunday showed a snap election would probably have results similar to the last ballot, in 2015, when a coalition of pro-independence parties formed a minority government.

        "title": "U.S. mayors ask Trump to keep young illegal immigration policy",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mayors from the largest U.S. cities warned President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday of the potential economic harm he might cause if he wipes out a program that allows young illegal immigrants to remain in the United States. They warned in a letter that as much as $9.9 billion in tax revenue would be lost over four years and $433.4 billion in U.S. gross domestic product would be wiped out over 10 years if he cancels a policy aimed at protecting these people from deportation. DACA, or The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, was created through an executive order in 2012. It allows undocumented young people brought to the United States before the age of 16 to remain without fear of deportation as they pursue a higher education, work or engage in  military service. The deferred action is subject to renewal every two years. The mayors asked for the program to allow for initial applications and renewals to continue until \u201cCongress modernizes our immigration system and provides a more permanent form of relief for these individuals.\u201d As president, Trump would have the authority to undo DACA. \u201cThis program helps foster economic growth and enhances public safety and national security,\u201d said the letter, written by the Democratic Mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, and signed by mayors of other major U.S. cities including New York, Los Angeles, and Houston. \u201cWe are clear as mayors that these are dreamers who are seeking the American Dream, and we should embrace them rather than do a bait-and-switch,\u201d Emanuel said after presenting Trump the letter at a meeting in New York. Trump has called for the deportation of illegal immigrants, an estimated 11 million people, and promised to build a wall on the border with Mexico. According to the letter, which was made available to the press, nearly 742,000 undocumented youths have participated in DACA. DACA is part of the broader immigration issue of municipalities that offer themselves up as \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d where local law enforcement refuse to report to federal authorities undocumented immigrants they encounter. Trump has threatened to cut off federal funding for those municipalities. While he would have the authority to cut some kinds of funding, mayors of those cities have said they will not be pressured to report migrants to federal agents. Santa Ana city council voted on Tuesday to declare their community in Southern California of 325,000 people, half of whom are foreign born and 80 percent of Hispanic descent, a sanctuary city. In Los Angeles, the County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted to ask county departments to provide plans for shielding undocumented immigrants from U.S. immigration authorities, said Jessie Gomez, a spokeswoman for Supervisor Hilda Solis.  The board oversees health, law enforcement and social welfare departments that operate county-wide but it does not administer the city of Los Angeles. Nearly one million residents of Los Angeles County are believed to be undocumented immigrants, according to Solis\u2019 office. White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Wednesday said he could not address the incoming president\u2019s potential actions but that the current administration was working to ensure Trump\u2019s team understood why Obama pursued the policy.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe president\u2019s been crystal clear, both in words and deeds, about his view that young people who are American in every way but their papers shouldn\u2019t be deported ... A policy of deporting them would be inconsistent with our values,\u201d Earnest said of DACA. ",

        "title": "Trump moves ahead with wall, puts stamp on U.S. immigration, security policy",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall and punishment for cities shielding illegal immigrants while mulling restoring a CIA secret detention program as he launched broad but divisive plans to reshape U.S. immigration and national security policy. A draft executive order seen by Reuters that Trump is expected to sign in the coming days would block the entry of refugees from war-torn Syria and suspend the entry of any immigrants from Muslim-majority Middle Eastern and African countries Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Yemen while permanent rules are studied. Less than a week into his presidency, Trump has moved aggressively to put his stamp on a range of policies, including steps to gut the healthcare system devised by his predecessor, and make clear that as president he is not turning toward more moderate positions than he took as a candidate. His directives on Wednesday signaled a tough action toward the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States, most from Latin America, whom he already has threatened to deport. In a move critics called a slight to the integrity of American democracy, Trump also said on Wednesday he would seek a \u201cmajor investigation\u201d into what he believes was voter fraud in the November election, despite overwhelming consensus among state officials, election experts and politicians that it is rare in the United States.  \u201cWe are going to restore the rule of law in the United States,\u201d Trump told an audience that included relatives of people killed by illegal immigrants at the Department of Homeland Security after signing two executive orders. The directives ordered the construction of a multibillion-dollar wall along the roughly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) U.S.-Mexico border, moved to strip federal funding from \u201csanctuary\u201d states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants, and expanded  the force of American immigration agents. His plans prompted an outcry from immigrant advocates and Democratic lawmakers who said Trump was jeopardizing the rights and freedoms of millions of people while treating Mexico as an enemy, not an ally, and soiling America\u2019s historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants of all stripes. \u201cThe border wall is about political theater at the expense of civil liberties,\u201d said Christian Ramirez, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition immigrant advocacy group. \u201cIt is not national security policy. Border communities are among the safest in the nation, and patrolling them with tens of thousands of heavily armed, poorly trained, unaccountable agents puts lives at risks. This will turn these communities into de facto military zones,\u201d Ramirez said. The White House said the wall would stem the flow of drugs, crime and illegal immigration into the United States. \u201cWe are in the middle of a crisis on our southern border: The unprecedented surge of illegal migrants from Central America is harming both Mexico and the United States,\u201d Trump said, adding: \u201cA nation without borders is not a nation.\u201d The immigration crackdown has sparked fear among so-called \u201cdreamers,\u201d whose parents brought them to the United States illegally and who received temporary deportation relief and work permits from President Barack Obama. Trump said the dreamers should not fear deportation. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be very worried,\u201d Trump told ABC News in an interview broadcast on Wednesday.. \u201cWhere you have great people that are here that have done a good job, they should be far less worried,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ll be coming out with policy on that over the next period of four weeks.\u201d House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan also said the \u201cdreamers\u201d should not be worried. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on physical security of the border, we\u2019re focused on those who are coming to do us harm from terrorist states and things like that,\u201d he told MSNBC. Trump is also expected to order a review that could lead to bringing back a CIA program for holding terrorism suspects in secret overseas \u201cblack site\u201d prisons where interrogation techniques often condemned as torture were used during former Republican President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, two U.S. officials said.  Trump\u2019s actions could further test relations with Mexico. The wall plan has infuriated Mexicans. Trump\u2019s policies, including his demand that the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada be renegotiated or scrapped, have put Mexico\u2019s government on the defensive. Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto are due to meet next week. Pena Nieto said on Wednesday night that he \u201cregrets and disapproves\u201d of the push by Trump to build a new wall along the border. Officials in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Denver, Washington, San Francisco and Seattle offer some forms of protection to illegal immigrants. Billions of dollars in federal aid to those cities, often governed by Democrats, could be at risk under Trump\u2019s move. In the ABC News interview, Trump said construction on the wall would start within months, with planning starting immediately, and that Mexico would pay back to the United States \u201c100 percent\u201d of the costs. Mexican officials have said they will not pay for the wall. The White House said Trump\u2019s goal was to get the wall started as quickly as possible using existing government funds and then work with the Republican-led Congress on further appropriations. Trump made cracking down on illegal immigration a key element of his presidential campaign, with supporters at his rallies often chanting: \u201cBuild the wall.\u201d The cost, nature and extent of the wall remain unclear. Trump last year put the cost at \u201cprobably $8 billion,\u201d although other estimates are higher, and he said the wall would span 1,000 miles (1,600 km) because of the terrain of the border. Trump\u2019s directives would end the practice known by critics as \u201ccatch and release\u201d in which authorities apprehend illegal immigrants on U.S. territory but do not immediately detain or deport them. The directives also include hiring 5,000 more U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents used to apprehend people seeking to slip across the border and tripling the number of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents used to arrest and deport immigrants living in the United States illegally. They also create more detention space for illegal immigrants along the southern border to make it easier to detain and deport them. The intent of the proposals regarding refugees and immigrants from the seven Muslim-majority nations is to head off Islamist violence in the United States. The draft directive on immigration also suspends the U.S. refugee program for four months while determining whether permanent changes to the system are needed. ",

        "text": "LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Wednesday summoned a police officer investigating the case of a missing peace activist who is believed to have been kidnapped by unidentified men this month. Four activists critical of the army and its attitude towards militant groups went missing this year but reappeared after about a month. Two later said Pakistani military intelligence agents abducted and tortured them. The military denied the accusations. The latest activist to go missing is Raza Mehmood Khan, 40, a member of Aghaz-i-Dosti (Start of Friendship) group that works to build peace between arch-rivals Pakistan and India. He has not been heard from since Dec. 2 and his family filed a writ of habeas corpus in a court in the eastern city of Lahore in the belief he has been unlawfully detained, a lawyer acting for his family said. The Lahore High Court took up the case on Wednesday and the presiding judge, Anwar ul Haq, asked for the officer in charge of the police station handling the case to appear at the next hearing on Dec. 19. The lawyer, Usama Malik, told Reuters a neighbor had called police on the night of Dec. 2 to report that Khan was being kidnapped by unknown men. Khan s brother and police arrived to find Khan gone, along with his mobile telephones and computer, the lawyer said. Police were not available for comment on the court summons on Wednesday. Police said earlier they had no suspect in the case and they were investigating. On the day of his disappearance, Khan had spoken at a forum on militancy.  Everyone discussed their views and, of course, Raza was very critical,  said a friend, Rahim-ul-Haq. Khan had also posted comments on Facebook critical of the military and its suspected link to some Islamist hardliners who at the time were protesting against the civilian government.  Liberals in Pakistan have long criticized what they see as the military s use of some militant factions to further its political and security objectives. The army denies sponsoring militant factions. It regards security policy, especially towards neighbors India and Afghanistan, as its responsibility. ",

        "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said on Saturday that nearly 3.5 million workers, party members and soldiers volunteered to join or rejoin its army to resist new U.N. sanctions and to fight against the United States in the current geopolitical tension between Pyongyang and Washington.  Rodong Sinmun, North Korea\u2019s official newspaper, said the volunteers had offered to join or rejoin the People\u2019s Army after the Korea Central News Agency (KCNA) issued a statement on Monday condemning new sanctions imposed by the United Nations  in retaliation for North Korean missile tests. Earlier this week, nuclear-armed North Korea threatened to strike the United States and its Pacific territory of Guam. KCNA said on Wednesday a mass rally was held in Pyongyang to support the government. North Korea has previously mobilized large crowds to show its resolve when tensions escalate. In August 2015, 1 million North Koreans offered to enlist or re-enlist in the army when a mine exploded in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas, raising additional tensions. North Korea warned foreign diplomats to leave Pyongyang in 2013 when it suspended work at a joint inter-Korean industrial park and threatened missile strikes on U.S. Pacific bases, notably in Guam and Hawaii.

        "title": "Hearing into murder of Malta journalist case struggles to start",
        "text": "VALLETTA (Reuters) - A second magistrate in less than a week has recused herself from hearing court evidence in Malta against three men accused of the murder of anti-corruption blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia. The double abstention has jeopardized the launch of judicial proceedings against the three men and underscored the interwoven nature of public life on the Mediterranean island of Malta - the smallest nation in the European Union. The initial magistrate assigned to the case stood down last Thursday after defense lawyers complained that she knew one of Caruana Galizia s sisters and had sent her condolences following the Oct. 16 killing. On Monday, a replacement magistrate, Charmaine Galea, said she was also withdrawing from the case because the blogger had written about her and her alleged connections to the government. She said that justice had to be done and be seen to be done. A new magistrate was subsequently assigned to the suit and the preliminary hearing was scheduled to resume on Tuesday.  Under Maltese law, the compilation of evidence must be presented within a 30-day time frame and a lawyer for Caruana Galizia s family warned the delays could sink the case. The trio were charged on Dec. 4, giving the court until Jan. 4 to hear the evidence and decide whether to call a trial. The three suspects, brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio, and Vince Muscat have denied any wrongdoing. The three were known to local police and had never been the target of any of Caruana Galizia s often fierce blogs. Caruana Galizia was killed instantly when the car she was driving was blown up. According to Maltese media, the three suspects were arrested on the basis of phone intercepts and analysis of triangulation data showing their locations at the time of the murder.  The reports said one of the suspects had to call a local telecom company shortly before the bomb went off to top up the credit on the mobile phone that was used to detonate the explosives - a error that led police straight to the trio.  The government has announced a one-million-euro ($1.2-million) reward to anyone giving enough information for convictions. Caruana Galizia s family have denounced the handling of the case and expressed fears that those behind the murder will never be brought to justice. ($1 = 0.8482 euros) ",

He was speaking as he launched a new partnership between Britain s Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the younger royals  charity. Harry, who spent 10 years in the military, including two tours of Afghanistan, joined forces with Britain s Defence Secretary Michael Fallon to promote a new initiative to offer mental health support to those in the armed forces, their families and veterans.  Crucially, fighting fitness is not just about physical fitness. It is just as much about mental fitness too,  Harry said. The new partnership will see the Royal Foundation, established by Harry, his elder brother Prince William and William s wife Kate to support their chosen charities, provide advice and resources to the MoD to raise awareness of good mental health and improve training, education and information sharing.  Our soldiers, sailors and airmen are the best in the world but we will only maintain that if we are as serious about improving mental health as we are our combat skills and cutting-edge technology,  Fallon said.  Since Harry left the military, he has made campaigning over mental health issues and the fate of veterans two of his priorities. Earlier this year he revealed he himself had come  very close to a breakdown  a number of times following the death of his mother, Diana, when he was 12 years old.

        "title": "Clinton names close confidants, Obama veterans to transition team",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton\u2019s White House transition team, a mix of former advisers of President Barack Obama, close confidants, long-time colleagues and former elected officials, reflects the sense of careful organization the Democratic candidate has aimed to project in her presidential campaign. But her Republican rival, Donald Trump, could seize on the group to make the point that she is part of the establishment he aims to defeat in November\u2019s election, and to reiterate his charge that a Clinton administration would be an Obama \u201cthird term.\u201d The group, which the Clinton campaign named on Tuesday and which will lay the groundwork for her to take charge quickly if she wins, is evidence of Clinton\u2019s long experience in Washington as a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady. Transition teams aim to help the president-elect make key decisions during the period between the election and the inauguration, in this case from Nov. 8 to Jan. 20, so the new White House occupant can fill leadership posts quickly. \u201cThey are the names you would expect \u2013 people who have been advising her for a long time; people who have worked with her for a long time and people who are peers, who she respects,\u201d Matt Bennett of the moderate Democratic group Third Way said of Clinton\u2019s transition team.  The group will be headed by Ken Salazar, a former interior secretary and U.S. senator. He will lead four co-chairs: former Obama national security adviser Tom Donilon; former Obama aide Neera Tanden, who now leads the progressive think tank the Center for American Progress; former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm and Maggie Williams, the director of Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics. Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, will be the chief economist. Two additional policy advisers from Clinton\u2019s campaign, Ed Meier and Ann O\u2019Leary, will also move full-time to the transition team, the campaign said in a statement. The transition team does not necessarily reflect future policy. \u201cThe job here is to give options, not just say there is one policy course you want to take,\u201d said Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, who advised the presidential campaigns of Al Gore and John Kerry. Clinton would be the first woman elected to the U.S. presidency and Shrum said Clinton\u2019s team \u201chas got to be the first transition team in history where the majority of its members are women.\u201d Shrum added that Clinton is largely following Obama\u2019s template as he prepared for his transition after the 2008 election. Tanden, who played a key role in shaping Obama\u2019s health care overhaul, is a member of Clinton\u2019s tight-knit inner circle, and has also worked for her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Williams was the 1992 transition director for Clinton when she became first lady, and then her chief of staff in the White House. Clinton worked closely with Donilon when she led the State Department from 2009-2013. Granholm, the former governor, is also a former state attorney general and has years of experience in Democratic politics. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee applauded the selection of O\u2019Leary and Boushey, praising their economic positions. The environmental group Greenpeace criticized Salazar for not curbing fracking in his home state of Colorado. The announcement of the team came as Clinton has gained momentum in the opinion polls, with the current RealClearPolitics average of national polls showing her 6.7 points ahead, at 47.7 percent to Trump\u2019s 41 percent.  Trump\u2019s campaign has struggled after he made a string of controversial remarks since formally winning his party\u2019s nomination last month. More establishment Republicans, alarmed by Trump\u2019s inability or unwillingness to rein in his provocative remarks, have distanced themselves from the candidate in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal, a leading conservative voice, said in an editorial on Monday that he should fix his campaign in the next three weeks or hand over to his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Trump, a New York businessman who has never held elected office, picked New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to head his transition team in May. ",

TheCityUK said Britain s withdrawal from the European Union should also not threaten the international dominance of English law and the prospects of an industry that generated 31.5 billion pounds ($42 billion) in revenue last year. The group, which lobbies for financial and legal services firms, said it was urging the government  to do everything it can to make sure Brexit does not act as a barrier to future growth opportunities but as a stimulant.   This includes the need to secure mutual market access to enable UK-based practitioners to continue to represent clients in EU jurisdictions.  The government needed to give details on how it planned to convert EU rules governing the industry into domestic law, and the process for signing up to international conventions. Legal services make up 1.5 percent of the UK economy and employ more than 311,000 people, TheCityUK said in a report on the industry.  More than 200 foreign law firms have set up shop in London and English law is used in 40 percent of global corporate arbitrations, it added.

        "title": "Obama: Trump displays ignorance, seeks tweets over solutions",
        "text": "ISE-SHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama disparaged U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday, saying the billionaire seeks tweets over solutions and has \u201crattled\u201d  foreign leaders with his pronouncements. Obama accused the real estate mogul and former reality TV impresario of making cavalier comments for provocative effect, and he urged all presidential candidates to take the high road in a boisterous and harsh campaign. Weighing in on the race to succeed him with his strongest broadside yet against Trump, Obama said fellow leaders from the Group of Seven nations \u201care surprised by the Republican nominee\u201d. \u201cThey are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements but they are rattled by them,\u201d the president told a news conference on the sidelines of a G7 summit in central Japan. \u201cFor good reason, because a lot of the proposals he has made display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines, instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe, secure and prosperous and the world on an even keel.\u201d  Many U.S. allies fear Trump will feed insecurity in countries worried about China\u2019s growing power, embolden nationalists and authoritarians, and unravel Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot\u201d to the Asia-Pacific.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Trump has also been accused of racism and bigotry for saying he would build a wall to keep out illegal Mexican immigrants and would temporarily ban Muslims from the United States. He has also made comments considered demeaning to women. The race between Trump on the one hand and the Democratic candidates, front-runner Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, and Senator Bernie Sanders, for the Nov. 8 election has become increasingly bitter and personal. Trump this week took his use of accusations against Clinton to levels unprecedented in modern U.S. presidential campaigns, making incendiary statements that television networks cannot resist covering, giving him hours of free media and putting his opponents on the defensive. Obama said it was natural for journalists in such a campaign to elevate \u201cevery roll, blink, speed bump, conflict, trash talkin\u2019\u201d, but urged, instead, that candidates from both sides  stick to the issues. \u201cGrumpiness arises where folks feel that we\u2019re not talking about issues but personalities or character.\u201d  Obama, a Democrat, issued his most extensive analysis to date of his own party\u2019s race, while refusing to take sides. He rejected a suggestion that beating Trump would get more difficult as the two parties\u2019 conventions approach in July, a period when the Democratic victor can focus on fighting Trump instead of the fellow Democrat, adding that the Democrat battle was tough. \u201cArguing against your friends is more draining than arguing against political opponents,\u201d Obama said. He said there were no big ideological differences between Clinton, an establishment candidate who is a former First Lady and senator, and Sanders, a firebrand populist who identifies as a Democratic Socialist. The president said it was important that the race eventually end in a way \u201cthat leaves both sides feeling proud of what they\u2019ve done.\u201d ",

        "title": "Trump clears way for controversial oil pipelines",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed orders on Tuesday smoothing the path for the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines in a move to expand energy infrastructure and roll back key Obama administration environmental actions.  Oil producers in Canada and North Dakota are expected to benefit from a quicker route for crude oil to U.S. Gulf Coast refiners. But going ahead with the pipelines would mark a bitter defeat for Native American tribes and climate activists, who successfully blocked the projects earlier and vowed to fight the decisions through legal action. Trump campaigned on promises to increase domestic energy production. Before taking office he said the Dakota pipeline should be completed and that he would revive the C$8 billion ($6.1 billion) Keystone XL project, which was rejected in 2015 by then-President Barack Obama. U.S. crude imports have fallen dramatically in recent years as domestic production has boomed, but the world\u2019s largest oil consumer still relies heavily on imports. Even though Canada is already the biggest source of U.S. crude imports, boosting the flow from a close ally is seen in Washington as a way to improve U.S. energy security. \u201cIt goes to show we as a nation build infrastructure that is part of a comprehensive energy plan to make our energy secure,\u201d Republican Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota told Reuters.  TransCanada Corp said it would resubmit an application for a permit for Keystone XL after Trump signed an order saying the company could re-apply. The application will be reviewed by the U.S. State Department, which has 60 days to reach a decision.  The orders look set to undo victories won by protesters in North Dakota against Energy Transfer Partners, which has nearly completed construction of the Dakota line. Despite the advanced phase of the project, the Obama administration in December denied the company a permit to tunnel under the Missouri River. Protesters rallied for months against plans to route the $3.8 billion pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, saying it threatened water resources and sacred Native American sites. At one point, nearly 10,000 people had flocked to federal land in North Dakota, including 4,000 veterans after protests turned violent at times. The main protest camp has dwindled to several hundred after the Standing Rock tribe asked activists to leave when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied the easement. In a statement on Tuesday, the Standing Rock Sioux said they would fight the orders. \u201cAmericans know this pipeline was unfairly rerouted towards our nation and without our consent. The existing pipeline route risks infringing on our treaty rights, contaminating our water and the water of 17 million Americans downstream,\u201d said Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock tribe. The North Dakota Petroleum Council, the trade group for state oil producers relying on Dakota Access to expand their crude transport options, cheered Trump\u2019s order. About 1 million barrels a day are currently produced in North Dakota. \u201cWe think this is a great step forward for energy security in America,\u201d said Ron Ness, the council\u2019s president.         The more than 800,000 bpd Keystone XL pipeline would bring heavy crude from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The project was conceived nearly a decade ago, but since then the U.S. shale revolution has redefined oil flows, with domestic refiners finding themselves awash with supply and needing fewer imports.  Canadian Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said in Calgary that Keystone XL has all the regulatory approvals it needs in Canada, and that the project would be \u201cvery positive for Canada.\u201d                    Environmental activists campaigned against the Keystone XL pipeline for more than seven years, eventually winning a victory when Obama rejected the project in 2015.  Trip Van Noppen, president of nonprofit environmental law organization Earthjustice, said in a statement that Trump \u201cappears to be ignoring the law, public sentiment and ethical considerations\u201d with the decision. TransCanada shares closed up 2.7 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  Trump said on Tuesday in Washington that Keystone XL would create 28,000 jobs, but that figure is at odds with a 2014 U.S. State Department environmental study that said the project would create 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs.  Shares of ETP, the company building the 450,000 barrel-a-day Dakota pipeline, ended the day up 3.5 percent in U.S. trading.  Trump owned ETP stock through at least mid-2016, according to financial disclosure forms, and ETP\u2019s chief executive, Kelcy Warren, donated $100,000 to his campaign.  The protest against the 1,172-mile (1,885 km) Dakota pipeline was concentrated around blocking a permit to tunnel under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that forms part of the Missouri River, adjacent to the Standing Rock reservation. The Army Corps earlier this month said it would begin an environmental assessment that could delay the project further. Tuesday\u2019s White House memoranda said the Army and the Army Corps of Engineers should review and quickly approve permits for Dakota Access.  In Cannon Ball, North Dakota, protesters, many of whom have stayed at the camp for months, said they would continue fighting to protect the environment. At a protest in front of the White House, a few hundred demonstrators shouted slogans and carried signs, including one that read: \u201cNow environmental rapist.\u201d \u201cWhat happened today is an attack on our homes,\u201d said Jade Begay, a spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network, which fights against mining and dumping on native lands. \u201cWe are going to continue to show up at your home, Donald Trump.\u201d In New York City, about 300 protesters gathered outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower, chanting slogans such as \u201cIf all lives matter, then Native lives matter\u201d and \u201cYou can\u2019t drink oil, even in the soil.\u201d  Actress and activist Jane Fonda, speaking to protesters with a bullhorn, called Trump \u201cthe predator in chief\u201d and warned of the danger of oil spills.

        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - A rare sign of bipartisanship in the Illinois House on Friday fueled hopes of movement toward a spending deal, but a consensus failed to emerge in time to stop the state from heading into a  third-straight fiscal year without a budget. The record stalemate between Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has put the third-most populous U.S. state\u2019s credit rating in peril of dropping to junk. House Republicans on Friday helped advance a Democratic-drafted $36.5 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that begins on Saturday, but the deal stalled with negotiations continuing over a revenue package and an assortment of non-budgetary matters sought by Rauner. After a 90-25 test vote on the spending bill, House Speaker Michael Madigan said his legislative chamber will return to session on Saturday, and he sent letters to major bond-rating agencies imploring them not to downgrade the state\u2019s credit ratings to junk as budget talks continue. The impasse has ballooned the unpaid bill pile to nearly $15 billion as the state operated on spending mandated by state law and courts. Illinois, already the lowest-rated state, risked becoming the first U.S. state to have its credit downgraded to junk. Ted Hampton, an analyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which rates Illinois one notch above junk at Baa3 with a negative outlook, said the rating agency \u201cwon\u2019t refrain from changing a rating no matter the reason when it\u2019s appropriate to take action.\u201d S&P, which also rates Illinois one step above junk at BBB-minus, and Fitch Ratings, which has the state at BBB, declined to comment on Madigan\u2019s letter. Ahead of the House vote, Republican leader Jim Durkin said he and others in his caucus would support the budget bill amendment as a gesture of \u201cgood faith\u201d while talks continue on new taxes and non-budgetary reforms.  \u201cWe are close,\u201d he said on the House floor. \u201cWe are so close I can taste it.\u201d  House budget votes require Republican support to meet a three-fifths majority needed for passage. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good step forward, a step we can build upon. There\u2019s much work yet to be done,\u201d Madigan said following the vote. A final affirmative vote by the House on the spending plan would send it back to the Senate for concurrence. The House must still take up a revenue bill increasing personal and corporate income tax rates to raise more money for the cash-strapped state. ",

        "text": "HAVANA (Reuters) - Cruise company Carnival Corporation believes Cuba will soon modify rules that bar Cuban-Americans from traveling on its planned cruises to the island, the company said on Friday, after pressure mounted for the trip to be postponed.  Carnival is due to become the first U.S. cruise company to sail directly to Cuba in more than half a century on May 1, but the exclusion of Cuban-Americans has prompted a lawsuit against the company and protests in Miami. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday that Carnival \u201cneeds to not discriminate\u201d and called on Cuba to change the policy.  A State Department official later said Kerry \u201cin no way meant to convey that Carnival is supporting policies that are discriminating against Cuban American travelers.\u201d Asked whether Carnival was considering cancelling the trip, spokesman Roger Frizzell said the company was confident Cuba would change its rules before the sailing date.     \u201cWe continue to believe that Cuba will modify its regulation before we sail on May 1 based on our ongoing discussions with Cuban officials,\u201d Frizzell said, citing rules that allow Cuban-Americans to visit Cuba by air as an example.

        "title": "Mediterranean \"by far world's deadliest border\" for migrants: IOM",
        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - More than 33,000 migrants have died at sea trying to reach European shores since 2000, making the Mediterranean  by far the world s deadliest border , the United Nations migration agency said on Friday. After record arrivals from 2014 to 2016, the European Union s deal with Turkey to stop arrivals to Greece and blocks on migrants inside Libya and off its coast have greatly reduced the flow, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. Professor Philippe Fargues of the European University Institute in Florence, author of the report, said the figures probably underestimated the actual scale of the human tragedy.   The report states that at least 33,761 migrants were reported to have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean between the year 2000 to 2017. This number is as of June 30,  IOM s Jorge Galindo told a Geneva news briefing.  It concludes that Europe s Mediterranean border is by far the world s deadliest,  he said. So far this year some 161,000 migrants and refugees have arrived in Europe by sea, about 75 percent of them landing in Italy with the rest in Greece, Cyprus and Spain, according to IOM figures. Nearly 3,000 others are dead or missing, it said.  Shutting the shorter and less dangerous routes can open longer and more dangerous routes, thus increasing the likelihood of dying at sea,  Fargues said. The report said:  Cooperation with Turkey to stem irregular flows is now being replicated with Libya, the main country of departure of migrants smuggled along the central route; however, such an approach is not only morally reprehensible but likely to be unsuccessful, given the context of extremely poor governance, instability and political fragmentation in Libya.  Though sea arrivals to Italy are down almost a third this year, this week there was a surge in rescues and attempted crossings. On Friday, Libya s EU-backed coastguard intercepted more than 600 mainly sub-Saharan African migrants, including many women and children, from a total of five boats that had left from the coast east of the Libyan capital, Tripoli, coast guard officials said. On Wednesday and Thursday, Italy s coast guard said some 1,600 migrants were rescued from nearly 20 vessels in the central Mediterranean.  Libya s U.N.-backed government said on Thursday it was investigating reports of African migrants being sold as slaves and promised to bring the perpetrators to justice. Footage broadcast by CNN appearing to show African migrants being traded in Libya sparked an international outcry and protests in Europe and Africa. ",

        "title": "Italian Senate approves electoral law; likely to produce hung-parliament",
        "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italy s upper house Senate approved on Thursday a new electoral system that is expected to handicap the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement at a forthcoming national election and favor mainstream political blocs. The bill has already been approved by the lower house thanks to a battery of confidence motions that swept aside all opposition and now only needs a green light from the head of state to become law. This is expected in the coming days. The voting system, a mix of proportional representation and first-past-the-post, will benefit parties that form pre-election coalitions   something the 5-Star has always ruled out. With opinion polls pointing to a three-way split between the centre-left, centre-right and 5-Star, analysts say the new electoral law will not produce a clear-cut winner at the next election, which is due by May 2018. Italy has had 64 governments since the end of World War Two, including five in the past seven years, and a renewed bout of political instability in the euro zone s third-largest economy could hurt global financial markets. To prevent a financial backlash, analysts say some form of grand coalition between the more moderate parties on the left and right is likely to emerge from any ballot-box stalemate.  You are all the same. You don t have any ideas or any policies, just the same mission: to keep hold of your seats and continue to squeeze the country dry,  the 5-Star Senate leader, Giovanni Endrissi, told the upper chamber on Thursday. Polls show the 5-Star is currently the most popular party in Italy, with support at around 30 percent nationally. President Sergio Mattarella had called on parliament to draw up a new law to harmonize the existing voting rules that risked throwing up different results in the two houses.  All previous attempts at reform fell foul of political infighting but, unexpectedly, the ruling Democratic Party (PD) of former prime minister Matteo Renzi struck a deal with Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia party over a revised voting system. The rightist Northern League also backed the initiative.  This law is the fruit of delicate mediation between coalition and opposition parties, which are very different parties with very different interests,  said Luigi Zanda, PD Senate leader. This will be Italy s third electoral law since 1993 and gives political leaders the power to pack electoral lists with supporters, potentially stifling internal party debate. The first-past-the-post element will benefit parties that have a strong local base, notably the Northern League, which looks set to win a large majority of seats in the wealthy north. Under the new system, IXE pollsters predicted on Thursday that a centre-right bloc made up of Forza Italia, the Northern League and Brothers of Italy party would win 269 of the 630 seats up for grabs in the lower house.  Renzi s PD allied with a small centrist party would take 180 seats and 5-Star 153 seats. A small bloc of leftist parties that have rebelled against Renzi, would take 20 seats, IXE said. Approval of the electoral law leaves parliament with one final task to complete before the houses can be dissolved   the reading of the 2018 budget. That legislation is expected to be passed by Christmas, which could open the way for national elections as early as March. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The outcome of Alabama\u2019s Dec. 12 U.S. Senate election probably will not be certified until Dec. 26 at the earliest, a state official said on Friday, making it unlikely the race will affect major year-end legislation in Congress including Republican tax cuts. Republicans hold a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate. A victory by Democrat Doug Jones over Republican Roy Moore, who is facing sexual misconduct allegations, in the Alabama race would cut that margin to 51-49, making it harder for President Donald Trump\u2019s party to win congressional passage of major legislation. Lawmakers are due to take up legislation on government funding and immigration in December and also will try to pass a sweeping Republican tax cut bill ahead the Dec. 25 Christmas holiday. If the Alabama result is not certified until after Christmas, Republicans would have more time to get their legislative goals accomplished regardless of the Alabama contest\u2019s outcome. John Bennett, chief of staff for the Alabama secretary of state, said the state\u2019s 67 counties face a Dec. 22 deadline for officially reporting election results, but some are likely to miss it. Bennett said that would push the process back until after Christmas, making Dec. 26 the earliest possible date for certification. Once certified election results are available, a new senator would be sworn in during an open session of the Senate, according to Senate officials. With the Senate scheduled to be out the last week of December, the next open session would not be until early January.  ",

        "text": "AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas measures criticized as being discriminatory for limiting transgender people\u2019s access to bathrooms in schools and public buildings died on Tuesday, as the House adjourned and ended its special legislative session. Business leaders and civil rights groups had battled to defeat the bills, saying they advanced bigotry, would tarnish the state\u2019s image and damage its economy. The measures were blocked by moderate House Republicans.  Adoption by Texas, the most populous Republican-dominated state, could have fed momentum in other socially conservative states on the issue, a flashpoint in the U.S. culture wars. \u201cFinally, Texans can breathe a temporary sigh of relief,\u201d said JoDee Winterhof, an official of the Human Rights Campaign that lobbied against the bills. \u201cTexans don\u2019t want harmful, anti-transgender legislation,\u201d Winterhof, the campaign\u2019s senior vice president for policy and political affairs, said in a statement. Momentum for so-called bathroom bills stalled this year when  North Carolina partially repealed a similar law in March. The original law prompted boycotts by athletic bodies and businesses that are estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. Texas could have lost about $5.6 billion through 2026 if it had enacted such a measure, said the Texas Association of Business, the state\u2019s leading employer grouping. The House wound up its duties without taking action on any of the bills and adjourned \u201csine die,\u201d a day ahead of the official end of the 30-day special session. House Speaker Joe Straus, a pro-business Republican who controls the agenda in the chamber, said the issue was not a priority. Straus\u2019 position was reinforced by a well-financed campaign by major corporations, including Texas-based energy companies Halliburton and ExxonMobil Global Services, which have said the bills would make it hard for them to recruit top talent. The measure that advanced the farthest was Senate Bill 3, which passed easily on a party-line vote in the Republican-controlled Senate and then died in the House. It would have required people to use restrooms, showers and locker rooms in public schools and other state and local government facilities that match the sex on their birth certificate, as opposed to their gender identity. Supporters, including Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a staunch social conservative, say the proposed curbs promote public safety and protect vulnerable women and children. ",

        "title": "Mexico president replaces finance minister after damaging Trump visit",
        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - President Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday replaced his close ally and finance minister, Luis Videgaray, after the two were heavily criticized for Republican U.S presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s controversial visit to Mexico last week. A somber-looking Pena Nieto told a news conference that Videgaray, who officials said was the architect of Trump\u2019s visit, would make way for former Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade. Pena Nieto was widely pilloried for hosting Trump at short notice last Wednesday. The New York businessman has repeatedly vowed to build a border wall to keep out illegal immigrants - which he said Mexico would pay for. Trump has further infuriated Mexicans by threatening to carry out mass deportations and rewrite trade treaties crucial to their economy, and by referring to some immigrants from the United States\u2019 southern neighbor as rapists or drug runners With economic growth sluggish, the president\u2019s popularity at record lows and tensions palpable between the finance minister and other Cabinet members, rumors of Videgaray\u2019s impending departure had bubbled under the surface in Mexico for months. \u201cThe proverbial last straw was the Trump visit,\u201d said Agustin Barrios Gomez, a politician from the opposition leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, and a driving force behind a draft bill sent to Congress this week to empower the government to retaliate against Trump if he threatens Mexican interests. \u201c(It) was seen as such a fiasco that he no longer had the credibility necessary to do his immediate job,\u201d he added. Senior diplomats said Videgaray, 48, had been instrumental in arranging the American\u2019s visit, in which the government had hoped to impress upon Trump the need to moderate his tone and reconsider his more divisive campaign proposals. But within hours of leaving Mexico, Trump was telling a cheering crowd of supporters in Arizona that Mexico would pay for the border wall \u201c100 percent,\u201d prompting fresh ridicule of Pena Nieto at home. Instead of teaching Trump a lesson, the visit \u201clegitimized him as a potential head of state,\u201d said Andres Rozental, a former deputy Mexican foreign minister. \u201cIt just shows how little thought went into it.\u201d Trump commented on the resignation during a forum with U.S. veterans on NBC television when he was asked if the United States could take a chance with him as commander-in-chief. \u201cWell, I think absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if you saw what happened in Mexico the other day...I let them know where the United States stands. I mean, we\u2019ve been badly hurt by Mexico...And if you look at what happened, look at the aftermath today where the people that arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government. That\u2019s how well we did.\u201d Videgaray ran Pena Nieto\u2019s election campaign, and was long regarded as the most powerful Cabinet minister, with a huge influence on policy after orchestrating the country\u2019s landmark energy, telecommunications, tax and education reforms. Both men were embroiled in conflict-of-interest scandals in late 2014, after Pena Nieto\u2019s wife and Videgaray were found to have acquired property from a major government contractor. Pena Nieto ordered an inquiry, which cleared both of any wrongdoing. The respected new finance minister, Meade, is a friend of Videgaray and had started in the administration as foreign minister before moving to the social development ministry. Videgaray\u2019s departure from the Cabinet means Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong, on whose watch capo Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman escaped from prison before being recaptured, is now the most visible potential presidential candidate in 2018 for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. Polls show the main hopefuls for 2018 face a tough battle, with Osorio Chong leading prospective PRI contenders. Meade, who was also once energy minister, is among those hopefuls. He must now steer next year\u2019s budget through Congress, with the draft plan to be announced on Thursday. Senator Ernesto Cordero, a former finance minister from the center-right opposition, said he expected a smooth handover to Meade, whose experience in government he underlined. \u201cHe\u2019s been a minister five times, and on those five occasions he\u2019s done a good job,\u201d Cordero said. The economy has consistently fallen short of government growth forecasts during Videgaray\u2019s tenure, and contracted in the second quarter for the first time in three years. The new budget will be under close scrutiny after rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s last month said it could cut Mexico\u2019s credit rating following a marked increase in debt. Videgaray, who has also been rumored as a potential 2017 gubernatorial candidate for the PRI in the State of Mexico, a populous region next to the capital, will not take another public post, a finance ministry spokeswoman said.

        "title": "Two hawkish anti-immigration groups say consulted by Trump",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two groups that support far-reaching curbs on legal immigration to the United States and ideological screening of would-be immigrants to test their beliefs say Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has consulted them on his immigration policy. NumbersUSA and the Center for Immigration Studies, which for years have denied accusations they harbor radical views on immigration, told Reuters they had met or had telephone calls with either Trump or senior members of his campaign over the past year. Trump\u2019s campaign declined to confirm the meetings. Trump, the Republican nominee, has won over millions of\u00a0supporters with his calls for a wall on the Mexican border and a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. But the calls have also drawn an outcry from immigrant rights groups and condemnation from abroad.  While Trump\u2019s immigration proposals push the Republican Party sharply to the right, NumbersUSA and CIS also want to slash legal immigration, going beyond the New York businessman\u2019s call to keep it \u201cwithin historical norms.\u201d NumbersUSA says on its website that immigrants are the main driver of population growth, take jobs that should go to U.S. workers, and fuel urban sprawl that threatens farmland and wildlife habitats.  \u201cThe aim should be to halt all immigration possible,\u201d NumbersUSA head Roy Beck wrote in a blog in March. NumbersUSA wants to cut legal immigration to 500,000 a year immediately, said Chris Chmielenski, the group\u2019s director of content and activism. About a million immigrants obtain legal permanent residence status in the United States every year, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Around 11 million undocumented immigrants were living in the United States in 2014, down from a peak of 12 million in 2007, according to the Pew Research Center. The head of CIS, Mark Krikorian, has argued against legal immigration extensively. Last year he wrote in the National Review that mass legal immigration would end U.S. conservatism, because immigrants tend to have more liberal views on issues like gun rights. Beck told Reuters he had met with Trump in New York and had also spoken with people \u201cat the top\u201d of his campaign repeatedly since last autumn, when NumbersUSA accepted invitations to meet several Republican presidential hopefuls. Much of the contact was by phone and email. Beck would not provide details of what was discussed or say who took part in the discussions. In early August, NumbersUSA shared a 10-point immigration plan with the Trump campaign. Of the 10 points, six were echoed by Trump in a major immigration speech on Aug. 31. Those points included calls for the immediate deportation of undocumented immigrants with criminal records and the mandatory use of the \u201cE-verify\u201d system to check a job applicant\u2019s legal status.  The Trump campaign declined to comment on the apparent overlap. The policy was written with input from Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents. Beck said the overlap showed the \u201cconvergence\u201d of ideas between his group and the campaign but he acknowledged he had \u201cno indication that they sat down and looked at our 10 steps and said let\u2019s take six of them.\u201d     Based in Arlington, Virginia, NumbersUSA describes itself as the \u201cthe nation\u2019s largest grassroots immigration-reduction organization with more than 5 million participants.\u201d It is credited with helping block immigration bills in 2007 and 2013 that aimed to make it easier for undocumented immigrants to become citizens. Krikorian, of CIS, whose slogan is \u201cLow-immigration, pro-immigrant,\u201d said his group had also received requests for research and studies from the Trump campaign for months.  In an Aug. 15 speech, Trump outlined his plan for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of immigrants, calling for an ideological test to gauge their views on things like religious freedom, gender equality and gay rights to ensure the country only admits people \u201cwho share our values and respect our people.\u201d  CIS was an early proponent of ideological screening - widely criticized as discriminatory and a violation of freedom of thought - to protect U.S. culture and national security following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but it was unclear if Trump consulted CIS on the idea. The Department of Homeland Security already requires people seeking legal status in the United States to show they adhere to the principles of the Constitution. Krikorian took part in a roundtable of national security advisers at Trump\u2019s New York headquarters in August, after which he said he was asked by Trump\u2019s campaign to be a \u201csurrogate.\u201d A surrogate can act on behalf of a campaign, by speaking at rallies and other events. Krikorian said he turned down the Trump campaign\u2019s request.  Hate watchdog groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League have accused NumbersUSA and CIS of attempting to use mainstream arguments to sell proposals aligned with white nationalism. \u201cThese are the organizations that are the leading edge of the nativist movement in this country,\u201d said Frank Sharry, executive director of immigrants\u2019 rights group America\u2019s Voice.  Both organizations reject the claims. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely opposed to nativism,\u201d said Beck, adding that NumbersUSA\u2019s recommendations come from a desire to protect American workers. His group stresses that it blames bad immigration policy and not immigrants themselves. Krikorian said CIS wants \u201can ethnically neutral policy that lets in fewer people in the future and does a better job of welcoming those people we do legally admit to our country.\u201d (Adds dropped word, \u201cplan,\u201d in paragraph 14.)

        "title": "Key Republican Collins has 'serious concerns' on healthcare bill",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said on Sunday she has extreme reservations about the U.S. Senate\u2019s healthcare overhaul and does not think it will be able to pass this week. Collins, a moderate Republican who has not taken a formal stance on the bill, said she was concerned it would cut Medicaid too deeply and said she wants to see an upcoming analysis by the Congressional Budget Office before making a decision. \u201cI have very serious concerns about the bill,\u201d she said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d program. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to see the bill passing this week.\u201d Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has pushed for a vote before the July 4th Independence Day holiday recess that begins at the end of this week. He can afford to lose the support of only two Republicans in the face of unanimous Democratic opposition. Five Republican senators have announced they will not support the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, in its current form. One of those senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, called on Sunday for a slowdown in the process to give the Senate and the public time to evaluate the healthcare bill. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough information. I don\u2019t have the feedback from constituencies who will not have had enough time to view the Senate bill. We should not be voting on this next week,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Another senator who has announced that he does not support the current version of the bill, Rand Paul of Kentucky, said he would back it if the Senate reached an impasse on healthcare. \u201cIf we get to impasse, if we go to a bill that is more repeal and less big government programs, yes I\u2019ll consider partial repeal,\u201d Paul said on ABC. The Senate\u2019s 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump to undo former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. \u201cI think they have, at best, a 50-50 chance of passing this bill,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on ABC. He said Democrats \u201care doing everything we can to fight this bill because it\u2019s so devastating for the middle class.\u201d The House of Representatives has passed a measure similar to the Senate plan. The Senate would phase out Obamacare\u2019s expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually than the House bill, waiting until after the 2020 presidential election, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025.

        "title": "German vote could doom Merkel-Macron deal on Europe",
        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Weakened by the worst result for her party since 1949 and facing a more fractious political landscape at home, Germany s Angela Merkel could be forced to rein in plans to re-shape Europe together with France s Emmanuel Macron.  Merkel s conservatives garnered more support than any other party in the German election on Sunday, projections showed, ensuring that she will return for a fourth term as chancellor.  But her party appeared on track for its poorest performance since the first German election after World War Two and its only path to power may be through an unwieldy, untested three-way coalition with the ecologist Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP), fierce critics of Macron s ideas for Europe. Over the next four years, Merkel will also have to cope with a more confrontational opposition force in the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a eurosceptic, anti-immigration party that rode a wave of public anger after her decision to open Germany s borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants in 2015. The AfD was on track to win over 13 percent, above what polls had predicted. They will become the first far-right party to enter the German parliament since the 1950s. This will be a new world for Merkel, who has grown accustomed to cozy coalitions and toothless Bundestag opposition  during her 12 years in power.   In my mind, reform of the euro zone is the single most important foreign policy issue that the new government has in front of it,  said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, who runs the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund. But he predicted a so-called  Jamaica  coalition between Merkel s conservatives, the FDP and the Greens - whose combined party colors of black, yellow and green are like those the Jamaican national flag - would struggle to deliver.  Whereas the Greens said on Sunday night that a  stronger Europe  was a priority for the party, the FDP is averse to further steps to integrate policies at European level.  It would be the party of no, the party of yes and an incrementalist chancellor. Those are not ideal conditions for a Franco-German grand bargain,  he said. Macron ran for the French presidency on a pledge to  relaunch  Europe, in tandem with Germany, after years of economic and financial crisis and the new shock dealt by Britain s vote last year to leave the bloc. He is due to flesh out his ideas in a speech at the Sorbonne University in Paris on Tuesday. Macron has called for a finance minister and budget for the single currency bloc, ideas that Merkel has tentatively supported even though scepticism in her own party runs high. But with the FDP as a partner and the AfD pushing back loudly in parliament, the prospect of selling deeper European integration to her new coalition and the wider public looks far more challenging. In its election program, the FDP called for a phasing out of Europe s ESM bailout fund and changes to EU treaties that would allow countries to leave the euro zone. Its young leader Christian Lindner openly called for Greece to return to the drachma during the campaign.  On Europe, the FDP is not so far from the AfD on some issues. If all of their ideas were implemented we would be plunged back into a euro zone crisis,  Franziska Brantner, a Greens lawmaker, told Reuters. The FDP would not be the only difficult ally in Merkel s coalition. The AfD s strong performance could push her Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU)   already a thorn in her side during the refugee crisis   further to the right ahead of an election next year in its home state. Winning back voters who fled to the AfD could become one of the main priorities for Merkel s conservative bloc over the coming four years. That would mean tougher stances on migration and on Europe. Even before the election, officials close to Merkel were playing down the urgency of a reform of the euro zone, describing efforts to secure Europe s borders and agree a fair distribution of refugees across the bloc as higher priorities.  A second refugee crisis would be more devastating to Europe than a second euro zone crisis,  a senior German official told Reuters last month. These officials point to the strengthening of the European economy and suggest that Macron was elected despite rather than because of his grand plans for the euro zone. A Bertelsmann Foundation survey last year showed just 41 percent of French believe Europe needs more political and economic integration, 10 points below the EU average. The survey also showed that Germans and French are the most skeptical toward Macron s ideas for a European finance minister and dedicated euro zone budget. Only 31 percent of French and 39 percent of Germans thought a euro zone budget should be used to support economically weaker states, as Macron suggests. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders brought his firebrand rhetoric back to the floor of the Senate on Tuesday to condemn a White House-backed bill on Puerto Rico\u2019s financial crisis as \u201ccolonialism at its worst.\u201d Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who turned an unlikely presidential bid into a political movement to combat inequality, warned that legislation due for a crucial Senate vote on Wednesday would subject Puerto Rico to Republican trickle-down economics and favor \u201cvulture capitalists\u201d at the expense of the island\u2019s increasingly impoverished population. An aide said it was the first time Sanders has spoken in the Senate since December. \u201cDoes that sound like the kind of morality that should be passed here in the United States Senate?\u201d Sanders fumed during an eight-minute appearance to support an hours-long speech by Democratic Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who opposes the bill. The Vermont senator used his appearance to rail against details of the legislation, which would put much of Puerto Rico\u2019s management in the hands of a seven-member oversight board and require the island to pay $370 million over five years for the board\u2019s administration costs even as it cuts funding for education, healthcare and pensions. In an exchange with Menendez, Sanders said, \u201cHow in God\u2019s name do you run up an administrative cost of $370 million,\u201d adding, \u201cI know this sounds so absurd that people may think I\u2019m misleading them.\u201d \u201cWould my friend from New Jersey agree that this is colonialism at its worst?\u201d asked Sanders, who announced last week that he would vote for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in her November election contest against Republican Donald Trump. \u201cOh absolutely,\u201d replied Menendez. The Puerto Rico bill, which has already been passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, faces opposition from both sides of the aisle in the Senate. Nevertheless, the Obama administration and Republican leaders are trying to get the bill passed before a July 1 deadline, when the island is scheduled to make a $1.9 billion payment on its $70 billion debt.

        "title": "Canada proposes health warnings, child-proof packs for legal pot sales",
        "text": "OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian government proposed on Tuesday mandatory health warnings and child-proof packaging as well as a licensing regime for all cannabis products in legislation ahead of the July 2018 legalization of recreational marijuana. The proposals, which will be open for public consultation for 60 days, include restrictions on packaging to ensure the products are not enticing to children as well as legal standards for quality control and potency, Health Minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor told reporters. The government is on track to legalize recreational marijuana by July 2018, making it the first Group of Seven country to do so. Petitpas Taylor said the government wants to set strict guidelines for the safety of cannabis products, but ensure micro-producers and big companies alike will have access to the market as long as they are licensed.  We want to make sure the market will be open to everyone. Some people will be small businesses and they can certainly apply for a license in order to have a micro-industry, if you will,  she told reporters, adding there is no limit to the number of licenses that will be available. The proposed regulations address the licensing, tracking, packaging and labeling of recreational and medical marijuana practices, and include a permitting regime for the cultivation, processing, sale, testing and import and export of cannabis. The federal government earlier this month proposed splitting with the provinces income from excise taxes on recreational marijuana, drawing criticism from Ontario, which is concerned it will face higher costs associated with the new law.  The federal government said it wants an excise tax on all cannabis products, including medical marijuana, of C$1 per gram (0.04 ounce), or 10 percent of the retail price, whichever is higher. Some provinces have asked the government to delay legalization, saying they need more time to set up a sales system and train police officers who will be enforcing the new rules. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the issue part of his 2015 successful election campaign and the Liberal government says regulating marijuana will keep it out of the hands of underage users and reduce drug-related crime. Shares of licensed producers, such as Canopy Growth, have soared in anticipation of legalization but the stocks are expected to face a bumpy ride in 2018. ",

        "text": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa and Morocco will resume diplomatic ties more than a decade after Morocco withdrew its ambassador from Pretoria, South African President Jacob Zuma said in a newspaper interview published on Sunday. Morocco recalled its ambassador from South Africa in 2004 after former South African president Thabo Mbeki recognized a breakaway region in the Western Sahara which Morocco claims as part of its territory.  Morocco is an African nation and we need to have relations with them,  Zuma told City Press in the interview.  We never had problems with them anyway; they were the first to withdraw diplomatic relations.  Zuma met Morocco s King Mohammed last week on the sidelines of an African Union-European Union summit.  They felt that even if we differ on the Western Sahara issues, the two countries should have a relationship,  Zuma said about Moroccan officials  position at the meeting. South Africa s official government position - as re-affirmed by Zuma in one of his state of the nation addresses - is to support  self determination and decolonization for the Western Sahara . The decision to re-establish ties with Morocco is likely to go down badly with some members of South Africa s ruling African National Congress (ANC), of which Zuma is leader.  The ANC - as one of Africa s oldest liberation movements - has long backed those seeking independence in the Western Sahara and has accused Morocco of occupying the region. The ruling party said in a statement it had  unequivocal support for Western Sahara  but that this did not mean it harbored enmity toward Morocco.   There is also no ANC policy that says South Africa should isolate Morocco,  the statement said. A spokesman for South Africa s foreign ministry could not be reached for comment on Sunday. Morocco has controlled most of the Western Sahara, which is rich in phosphates and has seen some initial oil exploration efforts, since 1975. A ceasefire in 1991 called for a referendum on self-determination for Western Sahara, but the vote has never taken place. ",

Members of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee voiced no objections to the nominations of billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, 79, as commerce secretary and veteran government administrator Elaine Chao, 63, as transportation secretary. Republicans control the Commerce committee by a single vote.

All Democrats on that panel voted against Tillerson.  Ross, a corporate turnaround expert who made his fortune investing in distressed steel, textile, auto parts companies and banks, is expected to take a lead role in shaping Trump\u2019s trade policies. These are aimed at protecting U.S. manufacturers from imports, renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and pursuing bilateral trade deals after Trump signed an order on Monday to cancel the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

        "title": "Trump picks white-collar crime lawyer to replace Comey at FBI",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday ended a fraught month-long search for an FBI chief after firing James Comey by selecting Christopher Wray, who has prosecuted and defended white-collar crime cases and represented New Jersey\u2019s governor in a political scandal. Wray, who must be confirmed to the post by the Senate, and Comey served together in the Justice Department under former President George Bush, and both worked on the government\u2019s case in the Enron Corp fraud scandal in the early to mid-2000s. Trump\u2019s announcement that he will nominate Wray as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation came a day before Comey\u2019s eagerly anticipated public testimony before a Senate committee. In written testimony released by the panel on Wednesday, Comey said Trump told him on Jan. 27 that \u201cI expect loyalty,\u201d and in a Feb. 14 meeting asked him to back off from a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s ties with Russia. The Republican president\u2019s search for a replacement for Comey after firing him May 9 was difficult. Leading candidates including former Senator Joe Lieberman took their names out of consideration, and Trump interviewed a series of contenders. In a statement, Trump called Wray \u201can impeccably qualified individual\u201d who will serve \u201cas a fierce guardian of the law and model of integrity.\u201d The White House has given shifting explanations on why Trump fired Comey during an FBI investigation into whether Trump campaign associates colluded with the Russians to help him with the 2016 presidential election. Trump has said he was thinking of \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d in dismissing Comey. Wray served from 2003 to 2005 at the Justice Department under Republican former President George W. Bush as an assistant attorney general in charge of its criminal division and oversaw the department\u2019s Enron task force. Wray and Comey helped bring the case against Kenneth Lay, the former Enron chairman convicted in 2006. Also involved in the Enron matter was Robert Mueller, then FBI director and now special counsel named after Comey was fired to investigate the Russia affair, as well as Andrew Weissman, who is now working for Mueller. The web of Enron connections underscores the reliance in Washington, even under a president who vowed to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d on an elite corps of corporate lawyers whose varied careers often intersect and who sometimes present conflict-of-interest issues. For instance, after he left the Justice Department and joined top international law firm King & Spalding, Wray represented Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal over massive traffic jams created as political punishment for a local mayor. That case and others taken on by Wray while in private practice could pose problems, said American Civil Liberties Union National Political Director Faiz Shakir in a statement. \u201cChristopher Wray\u2019s firm\u2019s legal work for the Trump family, his history of partisan activity, as well as his history of defending Trump\u2019s transition director during a criminal scandal makes us question his ability to lead the FBI,\u201d Shakir said. Wray represented Christie in a scandal that resulted in two of the governor\u2019s aides being convicted. Christie, who was a close adviser to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign and whose name was floated as a possible Comey replacement, was never charged. Christie on Wednesday called Wray \u201can outstanding choice, a non-political choice\u201d to head the FBI. Wray works as a King & Spalding litigation partner and represents companies and individuals in a white-collar criminal and regulatory enforcement matters. King & Spalding has represented Russian companies including state gas monopoly Gazprom, according to its website. According to the website, the firm\u2019s energy practice also has represented businesses taking part in deals involving Russian entities including state-owned oil major Rosneft. The firm has previous ties to Trump. Bobby Burchfield, a partner in its Washington office, serves as ethics adviser for the trust set up in January to isolate Trump from the day-to-day operations of the Trump business organization. The agreement has been criticized by some ethics experts as inadequate. Apart from possible conflicts, another question about Wray is whether the longtime white-collar lawyer is equipped to take over an agency that is increasingly focused on detecting and combating terrorism, espionage and cybercrime. \u201cThere are questions about whether he is experienced enough in intelligence, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, computer crimes, and issues like that,\u201d said one senior U.S. law enforcement official who asked not to be identified. \u201cThe biggest test the bureau is likely to face is not another Enron,\u201d the official said. Trump announced his selection of Wray in a surprise, early-morning Twitter message. Some Democratic lawmakers said the president\u2019s timing seemed intended to distract from Comey\u2019s scheduled testimony. \u201cIt is imperative that the next FBI director be of unimpeachable integrity and independence,\u201d Nancy Pelosi, the top House of Representatives Democrat, said. \u201cIn light of the president\u2019s constant efforts to block the truth, the nomination of Christopher Wray should be subject to the utmost scrutiny.\u201d Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wray\u2019s \u201cimpressive credentials make him more than ready\u201d to lead the FBI. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said he did not know Wray but that his resume suggests he is \u201cthe perfect kind of person\u201d for the job. ",

        "title": "Iran warns it would increase missile range if threatened by Europe",
        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - The deputy head of Iran s Revolutionary Guards warned Europe that if it threatens Tehran, the Guards will increase the range of missiles to above 2,000 kilometers, the Fars news agency reported on Saturday. France has called for an  uncompromising  dialogue with Iran about its ballistic missile program and a possible negotiation over the issue separate from Tehran s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Iran has repeatedly said its missile program is defensive and not negotiable.  If we have kept the range of our missiles to 2,000 kilometers, it s not due to lack of technology. ... We are following a strategic doctrine,  Brigadier General Hossein Salami said, according to Fars.  So far we have felt that Europe is not a threat, so we did not increase the range of our missiles. But if Europe wants to turn into a threat, we will increase the range of our missiles,  he added. The head of Iran s Revolutionary Guards military force, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said last month that Iran s 2,000-kilometre missile range could cover  most of American interest and forces  within the region, so Iran did not need to extend it. Jafari said the ballistic missile range was based on the limits set by the country s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the head of armed forces. Iran has one of the Middle East s largest missile programs and some of its precision-guided missiles have the range to strike Israel. The United States accused Iran this month of supplying Yemen s Houthi rebels with a missile that was fired into Saudi Arabia in July and called for the United Nations to hold Tehran accountable for violating two U.N. Security Council resolutions. Iran has denied supplying the Houthis with missiles and weapons.  Yemen is in total blockade. How could we have given them any missile?  Salami said, according to the Fars report on Saturday.  If Iran can send a missile to Yemen, it shows the incapability of (the Saudi coalition). But we have not given them missiles.  Salami said the Houthis managed to increase the range and precision of their missiles in a  scientific breakthrough.  Jafari, the head of the Revolutionary Guards, said on Thursday that Iran only provides  advisory and spiritual  assistances to the Houthis.  Iran long denied sending fighters to Syria to help President Bashar al-Assad in the fight against the rebels, and said the Revolutionary Guards  presence on the ground was advisory In what seemed to be a correction of Jafari s comments, Salami said on Saturday that Iran s support for the Houthis was  political and spiritual.  The United States has imposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, saying its missile tests violate a U.N. resolution that calls on Tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. The United States says Iran s missile program is a breach of international law because the missiles could carry nuclear warheads in the future. Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its nuclear program is for civilian uses only. ",

        "title": "USDA disavows gag-order emailed to scientific research unit",
        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Tuesday that an internal email sent to staff at its Agricultural Research Service unit this week calling for a suspension of \u201cpublic-facing documents,\u201d including news releases and photos, was flawed and that new guidance has been sent out to replace it. The ARS focuses on scientific research into the main issues facing agriculture, including long-term climate change. President Donald Trump has cast doubt on whether man-made climate change is real and has railed against ex-President Barack Obama\u2019s efforts to combat it. \u201cThis internal email was released without Departmental direction, and prior to Departmental guidance being issued,\u201d USDA said in a statement. \u201cARS will be providing updated direction to its staff.\u201d It said peer-reviewed scientific papers from the unit should not be blocked. \u201cARS values and is committed to maintaining the free flow of information between our scientists and the American public.\u201d The original email, sent Jan. 23, said: \u201cStarting immediately and until further notice, ARS will not release any public-facing documents. This includes, but is not limited to, news releases, photos, fact sheets, news feeds, and social media content.\u201d USDA officials said that after the email was sent, acting USDA Deputy Secretary Michael L. Young sent out a three-page memo to USDA agency department heads and other key agency officials outlining the interim procedures staff should follow. A copy of the interim procedures memo, dated Jan. 23 and seen by Reuters, shows many of the steps reflect either the same or similar measures taken by the previous administration. Reuters also saw a memo, dated Jan. 22, 2009, that was sent to agency officials by former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. The 2017 memo, however, differs in two main areas.  It centralizes the agency\u2019s media inquiries and social media presence through the Office of the Secretary. As part of that, the memo asks USDA agencies to \u201creview their websites, blog posts and other social media and, consistent with direction you will receive from the Office of Communication, remove references to policy priorities and initiatives of the previous Administration.\u201d It also rescinds the ability of USDA agencies to close an office or notify local delegations of office closures.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the Senate antitrust panel, sent a letter to the U.S. Justice Department on Friday urging that it reject any effort by the White House to inject politics into merger investigations. The letter follows a New York Times report saying that White House advisors battling television news station CNN mulled using a government review of AT&T Inc\u2019s plans to merge with CNN parent Time Warner Inc as leverage. \u201cAny political interference in antitrust enforcement is unacceptable. Even more concerning, in this instance, is that it appears that some advisers to the president may believe that it is appropriate for the government to use its law enforcement authority to alter or censor the press,\u201d Klobuchar wrote in a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Both the White House and Justice Department declined comment for this story. Klobuchar, who has herself expressed concern about the $85.4 billion megadeal, noted those concerns but added that the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust review should focus on consumer welfare rather than politics. Klobuchar also asked Sessions to report to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the antitrust subcommittee any White House staffer or presidential adviser who had contacted the Justice Department about the merger.  President Donald Trump has not commented publicly on the deal since the election but during his campaign he said it was an example of a \u201cpower structure\u201d that was rigged against him and \u201ctoo much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201d ",

        "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran harshly reacted to President Donald Trump s decision not to certify its nuclear deal with six major powers, and President Hassan Rouhani said Tehran might walk away if the continuing agreement does not serve the country s national interests. Defying Trump, Rouhani said Tehran will double its efforts to expand the country s defense capabilities, including the country s ballistic missile program despite the U.S. pressure to suspend it. Trump said in an address at the White House that he would not continue to certify the multinational agreement and warned he might ultimately terminate it.   No president can revoke an international deal ... Iran will continue to respect it as long as it serves our interests,  Rouhani said in a live television address, adding that Trump s speech was full of  insults and fake accusations  against Iranians.  While Trump did not pull the United States out of the agreement, aimed at preventing Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, he gave the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted under the pact. That increases tension with Iran as well as putting Washington at odds with other signatories of the accord such as Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union, who say the U.S. cannot unilaterally cancel the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers .   The Iranian nation has not and will never bow to any foreign pressure... Iran s deal cannot be renegotiated,  Rouhani said. Trump announced the major shift in U.S. policy in a speech in which he detailed a more confrontational approach to Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for extremist groups in the Middle East. Pragmatist Rouhani backed Iran s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), saying the IRGC will continue its fight against  regional terrorists.  The IRGC has always protected our nation against terrorists ... It will continue to help oppressed nations in the region,  Rouhani said. Iran accuses its regional rival Saudi Arabia of fuelling regional tension and the Sunni Muslim kingdom is at odds with Tehran s revolutionary Shi ite leaders in struggles across the Arab world, including Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Bahrain and Lebanon. The IRGC is Iran s most powerful security entity and wields control over large swathes of Iran s economy as well as considerable influence within its political system. ",

        "title": "Cambodia's political prince submits to its strongman",
        "text": "PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - With Cambodia s opposition warning of the imminent death of its democracy, the historic rival who once beat Prime Minister Hun Sen in an election said there was no option but to work with the strongman. Seventy three year-old Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Hun Sen s opponent in U.N.-supervised elections in 1993, has horrified Cambodia s main opposition party with a call for it to be dissolved after its leader was charged with treason. Ranariddh s career exemplifies not only the swings in Cambodian politics, but also the way Hun Sen, 65, has used force and cunning to neutralize enemies since defecting from the genocidal Khmer Rouge in the 1970s to help drive it from power.  Samdech Hun Sen, you want or you don t want, you like him or you don t like him, he brings about this national unity,  Ranariddh said, using the prime minister s formal title.  According to the law you are not allowed to harm national unity,  the white haired Ranariddh told Reuters on Saturday. Beside him, four aides nodded and pressed together their palms in deferential emphasis. Ranariddh s royalist Funcinpec party won no parliamentary seats in 2013 elections, but would be allocated most of those held by the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) if it is dissolved after the arrest of leader Kem Sokha last month.  Alongside the government, Funcinpec has sought a ban on the CNRP because of the arrest. Kem Sokha and his party dismiss the charges against him as bogus and an attempt to extend Hun Sen s 32-year rule at the head of the Cambodian People s Party (CPP) amid the biggest crackdown on critics of the prime minister in years.  The prince failed his people when he had the mandate to bring real peace,  said Mu Sochua, a deputy to Kem Sokha who recently fled to exile in fear of arrest.   Now, he is robbing his people of their right to choose the leader of their choice by collaborating with the CPP in the dissolution of the CNRP.  Ranariddh was summoned to politics from his post as a French law lecturer by his wily father, the late King Norodom Sihanouk. With royalist sentiment strong, Ranariddh beat Hun Sen in the 1993 election organized by the United Nations. But when Hun Sen threatened a return to war, Sihanouk did a deal that sidelined his son as a co-prime minister.  Ranariddh was driven into exile in 1997 after his forces were defeated by those of Hun Sen in bloody clashes in Phnom Penh. After international pressure, Ranariddh was allowed to contest elections a year after, but never again came close to winning and entered on and off alliances with Hun Sen. Splits in the party followed and after a spell overseas following accusations of financial scandal, Ranariddh returned in 2015. As he speaks, he switches between English and Khmer with a peppering of French.  We are not puppets,  Ranariddh said beside a huge portrait of his father.  We are definitely not an opposition party but we don t always, always, always say  yes, yes, yes, yes, yes . We can say  no .   Although the United States and other Western countries helped secure Ranariddh s return to Cambodia in the 1990s, he dismissed their criticism of Kem Sokha s arrest and calls on the government to stop moves to ban the CNRP.  I, Norodom Ranariddh, would like them to leave us free to decide,  he said. ",

        "title": "Obama lawyers move fast to join fight against Trump",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Johnathan Smith resigned from the U.S. Justice Department on Inauguration Day, he looked forward to spending time with his infant son, but that plan unraveled a week later when President Donald Trump unveiled his explosive foreign travel ban. Within two weeks, Smith had a new job as legal director of civil rights group Muslim Advocates and was drafting briefs for a successful court challenge to the ban, joining other former top Obama administration lawyers now fighting Trump. It is not surprising that Smith and some of his colleagues, political appointees of Democratic President Barack Obama, would leave the Justice Department now led by Republicans. What is unusual is how fast they have signed up to be Trump adversaries. Some Republican lawyers say they were less hasty in moving into oppositional roles post-election. George Terwilliger, a senior Justice Department official under President George H.W. Bush, described the Obama lawyers\u2019 actions as \u201cunprecedented to my memory \u2013 and really bad form.\u201d One reason for the Obama lawyers\u2019 quick moves, some of them said, was Trump\u2019s aggressive use of executive authority from day one, which was guaranteed to attract court challenges. Obama faced legal fights over executive power and some of his challengers were formerly lawyers for President George W. Bush, over issues such as immigration and Obamacare. But those came later in Obama\u2019s presidency.  Besides Smith, other lawyers who have jumped into the fray include former Attorney General Eric Holder, who is advising California\u2019s legislature on challenging Trump over immigration, environmental regulations and healthcare; and former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal, who is helping Hawaii contest Trump\u2019s revised travel ban. Influential Manhattan prosecutor Preet Bharara and another 45 Obama-era U.S. attorneys are out of jobs after the Trump administration asked them to resign on Friday. Many of the Obama lawyers keep in touch, but reject the notion, proffered by some Republicans, that Obama is behind resistance efforts. Some of the lawyers credit their rapid transition to Trump\u2019s hardline positions on key issues and to ethical concerns about his presidency and business interests. \u201cThere\u2019s a unique threat to our democracy and Constitution that we see in the assault the president is mounting on the Muslim community,\u201d said Smith, who worked on religious discrimination issues at the Justice Department. Norman Eisen, who was Obama\u2019s top ethics lawyer and later ambassador to the Czech Republic, had expected to focus on his work at a think tank after Trump\u2019s election. But instead, he said, \u201cthe ethics emergency of constitutional dimensions has galvanized me back into my initial Obama role.\u201d  Eisen is now also chairing Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group he co-founded. The group has already sued Trump over alleged ethics violations. Other Obama appointees taking on Trump include former White House lawyer Ian Bassin who has founded United to Protect Democracy, a new group probing Trump over ethics; and James Cadogan, who worked with Smith at the Justice Department, and is now at the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, a civil rights group already clashing with the new administration. Some career government lawyers, who are not political appointees and normally do not resign in power shifts, have also resigned to oppose Trump. One is Sharon McGowan, who worked on LGBT issues at the Justice Department. On Inauguration Day, she was offered a job as director of strategy at Lambda Legal, an LGBT advocacy group. McGowan said she decided to leave Justice when Trump named Jeff Sessions, a hardline conservative Alabama senator, to be attorney general. That was a \u201cgame-changer,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew there would be no chance for me to preserve what I\u2019ve been working on so hard.\u201d ",

His face hidden by a headdress, a man who identified himself as Lushsux said against the backdrop of a cement section of the Israeli wall in Bethlehem that he hoped his painting would draw attention to Palestinians stuck in  an indoor prison .

I just paint what I usually paint and maybe people will start looking at the background and looking at the razor wire and looking at people stuck in here, and maybe that ll work better,  he said in Australian-accented English. Murals on the barrier believed to be the work of Lushsux include one showing Trump kissing an Israeli watchtower and another depicting him placing his hand on the barrier and thinking about building a similar wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.

        "text": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The Iraqi government has dismissed a call from U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for Iranian-backed paramilitary units that helped Baghdad defeat Islamic State to end operations in Iraq. Speaking after a meeting on Sunday with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Saudi Arabia s King Salman, Tillerson said it was time for the Iraqi Popular Mobilisation forces and their Iranian advisers to  go home . Washington, which backed Baghdad against Islamic State, is concerned Iran will use its expanded presence in Iraq and in Syria to expand its influence in the region.   But Abadi showed unwillingness to meet Tillerson s demand.  No party has the right to interfere in Iraqi matters,  the statement from his office read. It did not cite the prime minister himself but a  source  close to him. Trained and armed by Iran, the Iraqi Popular Mobilisation forces often supported Iraqi government units in the fight against the militants who were effectively defeated in July when a U.S.-backed offensive captured their stronghold Mosul. They are paid by the Iraqi government and officially report to the prime minister, but some Arab Sunni and Kurdish politicians describe these militias as a de facto branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corp. Iraq s Sunni neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, share Washington s concerns over Shi ite power Iran s influence in Iraq, where the population is also predominantly Shi ite. But the office of Abadi, himself a Shi ite, said the forces were under the authority of the Iraqi government.  Popular Mobilisation are Iraqi patriots,  it said in the statement. The United States trained tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers in the course of rebuilding the Iraqi armed forces and has over 5,000 troops deployed in the country, providing key air and ground support to the offensive on Islamic State.

NBC anchor Lester Holt will ask questions at the first debate on Sept. 26 in New York, while ABC global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz and CNN anchor Anderson Cooper will co-moderate the Oct. 9 \u201ctown meeting\u201d style debate in St. Louis, the Commission on Presidential Debates said.  Fox News anchor Chris Wallace will moderate on Oct. 19 in Las Vegas, it said in a statement.

C-SPAN\u2019s Steve Scully will be a back-up moderator for all four of the debates, it added. Trump, the Republican candidate, has said he will take part in the three debates but wants to see the conditions. Representatives for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday\u2019s announcement. The New York businessman, who has never held elected office, has had repeated run-ins with the media since launching his campaign last year, charging networks like CNN with \u201cphony reporting,\u201d sparring with MSNBC hosts and insulting Fox News journalist Megyn Kelly.

NBC later cut other ties with the businessman, dropping his \u201cMiss USA\u201d and \u201cMiss Universe\u201d pageants, and Trump sued. NBC is a unit of Comcast Corp..

In a report endorsed by both its Republican and Democratic leaders, the House intelligence committee said Snowden was \u201cnot a whistleblower\u201d as he has claimed.  Most of the material he stole from the NSA was not about invasions of privacy, but revealed intelligence and defense programs of great interest to America\u2019s foreign adversaries, it said. The committee said that while the \u201cfull scope\u201d of damage caused by Snowden\u2019s disclosures remains unknown, a review of materials he allegedly compromised \u201cmakes clear that he handed over secrets that protect American troops overseas and secrets that provide vital defenses against terrorists and nation-states.\u201d     The committee released only a four-page summary of what it said was a 36-page investigative report that remains Top Secret, but the summary contained strong words about Snowden\u2019s actions and background. The report contains previously unreported allegations about Snowden and his possible motives for taking government secrets. It alleges that Snowden, who took refuge in Moscow after fleeing to Hong Kong, \u201cwas and remains a serial exaggerator and fabricator.\u201d It says his official employment records show that while he claimed to have left U.S. Army basic training because of broken legs, in fact he \u201cwashed out because of shin splits.\u201d The report says Snowden claimed to have obtained a high-school graduation equivalent, but in fact never did. It also says he claimed to have worked as a \u201csenior advisor\u201d for the CIA when in fact he was an entry-level computer technician. While the report says Snowden \u201cstole 1.5 million sensitive documents,\u201d other sources who have examined materials he turned over to media outlets say that the total is between 200,000 and 300,000 documents.  Some U.S. officials involved in Snowden-related investigations acknowledge that the U.S. government does not know how many documents Snowden downloaded, and that the 1.5 million figure is an estimate.     The report also disputes Snowden\u2019s motives for taking and leaking classified information, saying he got into a \u201cworkplace spat\u201d with NSA managers in June 2012 over how to manage computer updates. It says a contracting officer reprimanded him for failing to follow proper grievance procedures, and he began downloading classified information two weeks later. However, in 2013, Reuters quoted U.S. officials and other sources familiar with the matter as saying that Snowden began downloading such data in April 2012, almost a year earlier than had previously been reported at the time. The issuance of the House committee report coincided with the release of \u201cSnowden\u201d, a movie directed by Oliver Stone that portrays him as a whistleblower and hero. On Wednesday, prominent human rights advocates urged President Barack Obama to pardon Snowden before leaving office in January. U.S. officials have said Obama is not considering a pardon for Snowden, who is facing U.S. criminal charges for providing classified information to unauthorized persons. Ben Wizner, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who represents Snowden, dismissed the House committee report as lacking substance.  Wizner said the report\u2019s release a day before the Snowden film opens \u201cis evidence that people in the intelligence community are taking us seriously, that they are concerned that Oliver Stone\u2019s movie will help solidify Snowden\u2019s image as a true patriot, which he is.\u201d  ",

        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Turkey summoned Germany s ambassador to its foreign ministry on Monday, Berlin said, amid a mounting row between the two NATO powers. Der Spiegel magazine said Ankara wanted to raise a German parliamentary motion last year that declared the 1915 massacre of Armenians by Ottoman forces a genocide - a description that Turkey has long fiercely rejected. There was no immediate comment from Turkish authorities on the summons or the broader dispute, which has been exacerbated by the German parliamentary vote and Berlin s criticism of Ankara s rights record. Germany s foreign ministry said it was the 17th time its envoy Martin Erdmann had been summoned, underlining the divisions at a time when European powers are counting on Turkey to help contain migrant flows, and to confront Islamic State militants over its borders with Iraq and Syria.  Germany has criticized mass arrests carried out in Turkey since last year s failed coup against President Tayyip Erdogan and demanded the release of around a dozen German or Turkish-German citizens arrested in recent months. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is seeking re-election on Sunday, has called for Turkey s EU accession talks to be called off. Germany also says it is limiting arms sales to Turkey.  Turkey says Germany has ignored Ankara s requests for the extradition of suspects it believes are linked to the putsch and accused Berlin of using Nazi-like tactics by banning pro-Erdogan rallies on German soil. Turkey, which says the killings of Christian Armenians during World War One do not amount to genocide, already recalled its ambassador to Germany after parliament passed the resolution last year. ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry took a chartered jet to Ohio last week, according to an airport management company, the day before fellow Cabinet member Tom Price resigned over his use of private charter flights for government business. Perry took the private plane from Hazleton Regional Airport in Pennsylvania to the Greater Portsmouth Regional Airport in southern Ohio on Sept. 28, PMH Aviation, the company that runs the Portsmouth airport, said on Wednesday. The purpose of his trip was to visit a uranium facility in Piketon, Ohio, according to the Energy Department.  A receptionist at the company declined to answer questions about the cost of the flight. The only private jet to land at Greater Portsmouth Regional Airport last Thursday belonged to Dixie Capital Corp, a Richmond, Virginia-based charter company, according to data from the Flightaware website. Dixie confirmed it owned the plane, but declined to comment on Perry or say how much the trip cost.  A spokeswoman for Perry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Perry was joined in Ohio by U.S. Senator Rob Portman and two U.S. representatives from the state to visit the decommissioned uranium enrichment facility in Piketon, according to a statement last week by the senator\u2019s office. Local officials have been lobbying the government to reopen the facility. During his stop in Pennsylvania, Perry toured a coal mine. No commercial airlines serve Hazleton, but airports with commercial routes in Scranton and Allentown, Pennsylvania, are each an hour away.  Price resigned last week as U.S. health and human services secretary and promised to repay the government for some $52,000 worth of travel including private flights, after Politico and other media reported on his use of charters. On Monday, the watchdog agency overseeing the U.S. Interior Department said it had opened an investigation into the use of charter flights by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who took a recent private flight from Las Vegas to Kalispell, Montana, that cost $12,000.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan expressed confidence on Thursday that Congress will pass an overhaul of the U.S. tax code by the end of this year, a major but elusive goal for President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans. \u201cWe want America to wake up on New Year\u2019s Day 2018 with a new tax system,\u201d Ryan said, adding that his goal was to have a U.S. corporate tax rate at or below 22.5 percent, down from the current 35 percent. \u201cI think it\u2019s still very viable to get it done this year,\u201d Mnuchin said, calling the tax overhaul his and Trump\u2019s top priority. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to set a specific date. We\u2019re going to get this done as quickly as we can.\u201d Mnuchin and Ryan made their predictions a day after Trump reached a deal with Democrats to avert an unprecedented default on U.S. government debt, keep the government funded at the outset of the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and provide aid to victims of Hurricane Harvey. Mnuchin later met with Ryan, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and the Republican chairmen of the two congressional committees that are crafting tax legislation. The group of tax policymakers are known as the \u201cBig Six.\u201d \u201cThe major blueprint has been outlined. It\u2019s going to go to the committees,\u201d Mnuchin told Fox Business ahead of the meeting.  But there were no tangible signs of progress.  \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see something very soon,\u201d Cohn told reporters as he left the session. \u201cWe had a very good meeting today. We continue to work together. We continue to work well.\u201d A key Republican goal is to slash the corporate income tax rate, which Trump and congressional Republican leaders contend will make U.S. companies more competitive, create jobs and raise wages. But the president and Congress appear to be at odds over rates, and independent analysts say lawmakers may not be able to deliver a corporate rate low enough to be meaningful for companies without expanding the federal deficit. Trump has said he wants to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. Ryan, in an interview with the New York Times, indicated that a figure that low was unrealistic. \u201cThe numbers are hard to make that work,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe obviously wants to push this as low as possible. I completely support doing that, but at the end of the day we\u2019ve got to make these numbers work.\u201d \u201cOur goal is to be at or below the industrialized world average - and that\u2019s 22.5 (percent). So our goal is to get in the mid- to low 20s. And we think that\u2019s an achievable goal,\u201d he added. The White House hopes Wednesday\u2019s deal clears the decks for Congress to tackle the tax overhaul, a top Trump campaign promise. Even though Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, Trump has yet to win passage of any major legislation, with Democrats typically united against him. His administration previously has offered rosy predictions about the timing of a tax overhaul that have not come to pass. Mnuchin in February said the administration was committed to getting the tax overhaul through Congress by August. Mnuchin, Ryan and the rest of the \u201cBig Six\u201d have been negotiating a tax plan behind closed doors for months, excluding Democrats and producing only a few pages of basic principles.  Trump on Tuesday urged congressional leaders to make a big push on taxes with cuts for individuals and companies and tax breaks for businesses to bring back profits from overseas.  Republicans are still divided on significant issues such as whether tax cuts should be offset with spending cuts to avoid increasing the federal budget deficit and how much to lower the corporate income tax rate. In an interview with Fox Business Network, Mnuchin said he was not worried about the plan going off track because of either Democrats or conservative Republicans making their own demands. Many Democrats have voiced opposition to a tax plan that primarily benefits the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Asked whether he was concerned that Democrats could use the funding deal struck on Wednesday to make demands such as rejecting any tax cut for the wealthy or pushing for a cut for middle-income earners, Mnuchin said no. He also said he expected some Democrats to back the final tax plan. On Wednesday, Trump said he would offer more details about his tax reform plan in about two weeks. ",

President Robert Mugabe s wife Grace this week sued Jamal Hamed in a Harare High Court, accusing him of failing to deliver the 100 carat jewel she said she had ordered from him for her wedding anniversary last year. Grace, 52, who is seen as a possible successor to her 93-year-old husband, said Hamed had instead provided an inferior ring worth $30,000 and when she had complained had refunded only $120,000. But Hamed filed his own court application disputing the claim and demanded that Grace should supply the court with details such as a copy of the sale agreement and proof of payment before he put in his defense. Hamed s lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa said she had deposed the court papers on behalf of her client on Friday. In the court papers seen by Reuters, Hamed, a British national, said Grace should also provide proof that he in fact owned Zimbabwean companies the first lady wished to be sold to recover the money  When, exactly, is it alleged the payment was done? Full dates are required. Full details of the account holder, the account number and a copy of the account statement are required,  Hamed said in the court application. Grace s lawyer Wilson Manase did not answer his phone when contacted for comment. The court case has lifted a veil on the wealthy lifestyle of Mugabe and his wife, nicknamed  Gucci Grace  for her reputed dedication to shopping, at a time Zimbabwe is in the grip of a severe U.S. dollar crunch and cash shortages.

        "text": "LAHORE/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A newly freed Pakistani Islamist accused of masterminding a bloody 2008 assault in the Indian city of Mumbai called ousted former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif a  traitor  on Friday for seeking peace with neighbor and arch-foe India. The release of Hafiz Saeed from house arrest raised fresh questions as to whether Saeed might enter politics to run a new, unregistered political party founded by his supporters. India and the United States expressed concern at his release, calling for Saeed to be prosecuted over the Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including Americans. Saeed, who has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head, spoke at Friday prayers in a mosque in the city of Lahore after being freed from house arrest by a court that said there was no evidence to hold him. Saeed was placed under house arrest in January while Sharif was still prime minister, a move that drew praise from India, long furious at Saeed s continued freedom in Pakistan. In July, a Supreme Court ruling disqualified Sharif from office over a corruption investigation, though his party still runs the government with a close ally as prime minister. Saeed, however, said Sharif deserved to be removed for his peace overtures with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  Nawaz Sharif asks why he was ousted? I tell him he was ousted, because he committed treason against Pakistan by developing friendship with Modi, killers of thousands of Muslims,  Saeed said. India s Ministry of External Affairs condemned Saeed s release, saying it showed Pakistan was not serious about prosecuting terrorists. A U.S. official said Washington was  deeply concerned  about the release.  The Pakistani government should make sure that he is arrested and charged for his crimes,  U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. Saeed has repeatedly denied involvement in the 2008 Mumbai violence in which 10 gunmen attacked targets in India s largest city, including two luxury hotels, a Jewish center and a railway station. The assault brought nuclear-armed neighbors Pakistan and India to the brink of war.  I m happy that no allegation against me was proved,  Saeed told supporters after his release, according to a video released by the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) Islamist charity, which he heads. The United States says the JuD is a front for the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant group, which Saeed founded and which has been blamed for a string of high-profile attacks in India. Pakistan officially banned the Lashkar-e-Taiba in 2002. Saeed blamed India for his incarceration in Pakistan, saying  Pakistan s rulers detained me on the aspiration of Modi because of their friendship with him . Saeed has long campaigned in support of Muslim separatists in the Indian-ruled portion of the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir, which Pakistan also claims. India accuses Pakistan of supporting the LeT and other separatists battling in the Indian part of Kashmir. Pakistan denies that. While Saeed was under house arrest, his JuD charity launched a political party, the Milli Muslim League (MML), which has won thousands of votes in by-elections.  Senior government and retired military figures say the party has the backing of Pakistan s powerful military. The military denies any direct involvement in civilian politics. MML officials have privately said that the party is controlled by Saeed, but it is not clear if Saeed will seek to contest elections or launch a political career. ",

        "text": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - A congressional committee voted 39-26 on Wednesday to reject charges against Brazilian President Michel Temer stemming from a corruption case involving the world s largest meatpacker. The full lower house of Brazil s Congress still must vote on the charges but is expected to shelve them next week, sparing Temer from trial by the Supreme Court for alleged obstruction of justice and membership in a criminal organization.  Temer was accused of taking bribes and condoning the payment of hush money to a jailed politician in testimony by meatpacker Joesley Batista.  Temer has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyers argued that the case against him was flawed because it was based on an inconclusive recording that Batista secretly made of a conversation with the president. The lower chamber decides whether a Brazilian president can be put on trial. Two-thirds of its members must vote to approve a charge for it to move forward, a hurdle his opponents are not expected to clear. Temer survived an earlier corruption charge in the lower house in August in connection with the same graft scheme in which prosecutors accused him of arranging to receive a total of 38 million reais ($11.8 million) in bribes from JBS SA. In committee debates on Wednesday, opposition Congressman Alessandro Molon, of the center-left party called Sustainability Network, said Temer was part of a criminal organization that collected bribes. He accused the president of taking part in decisions on how the money was distributed. Workers Party lawmakers called for Temer to stand trial, saying the charges against him were more serious than those leveled at his predecessor Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached last year for a lesser crime of violating budget rules. But Temer s allies argued that the charges should be thrown out because the country needs Temer to serve out his mandate through the end of 2018 for political and economic stability. They said Temer has recovered Brazil from its worst recession, brought inflation under control, restored the purchasing power of Brazilian consumers and should stay in office to recover investor confidence. Presidential aides said Temer will now be able to get on with his economic policy agenda focused on boosting weak growth and bringing a bulging government budget deficit under control. The political capital and time Temer has spent defending himself, however, has delayed approval of a crucial overhaul of the pension system, the main cause of the fiscal deficit that cost Brazil s its investment-grade credit rating in 2015. Temer will be hard pressed to get the unpopular pension bill approved before the 2018 election year starts and promised reform of Brazil s burdensome tax system might is now unlikely.     ",

Abubakar is the first political heavyweight to signal a likely bid for the presidency, which could pit him against 74-year-old Buhari, who took power in 2015 but has been absent for much of this year due to illness.

In a statement announcing he was leaving the party, Abubakar said the APC  has failed and continues to fail our people  and accused it of  a draconian clampdown on all forms of democracy within the party and the government .

        "text": "MUMBAI (Reuters) - First he tried messaging friends, but WhatsApp was down. Then, the credit card readers at his clothing store weren t working. Ride-sharing apps were offline too.  Harsh Madhok, who runs a clothing business in Jaipur, a city of three million people, had read about internet shutdowns elsewhere in India.     Now he was in the middle of one in his city in central India, as authorities tried to damp down unrest following a traffic incident that led to clashes between police and locals.  It s very frustrating,  said Madhok, 45, of the Sept. 9 shutdown.  These things leave you feeling like you don t know what s going on.  Under the rule of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India s Hindu nationalist leader, Internet shutdowns have escalated sharply in the world s largest democracy.  According to a database maintained by the Software Freedom Law Centre, an online advocacy group in New Delhi, government officials ordered shutdowns 42 times between January and August in 2017. That compares with six times in all of 2014, when Modi first came to power. This year the shutdowns were spread over 11 states, compared to just one in 2012. The disconnections, which state governments have said are necessary for maintaining public order, typically happen without official explanation.  They have followed farmer agitations, protests by a minority community calling for government jobs, and public violence sparked by a Facebook post. The frequency of the shutdowns has raised concerns that internal security is being used as a justification to clamp down on freedom of expression. That refrain has been heard more frequently since Modi s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), won elections in 2014 with an emphasis on security.  If citizens are using the internet to mobilize themselves, then how is shutting down the internet any different from suppressing dissent?  an editorial in Mint asked in July. Until this year, shutdowns were implemented under colonial-era curfew laws that were used as the basis for rules requiring internet service providers to shut off connections at the request of any government agency. In early August, the Ministry of Communications issued new explicit rules that formalized the power of states and the central government to block the internet.  These rules are among the first of their kind in a democracy,  said Raman Jit Singh Chima, policy director of Access Now, a U.S.-based organization that works on technology policy and digital rights worldwide.  How they re used, and their scale - they seem to be creating an architecture where blocking is legitimized,  Chima said.  What s changed, I think, is that officials have greater knowledge of the power they can utilize,  said Apar Gupta, a lawyer who handles free-speech cases before the Supreme Court. Other countries, such as Egypt, have also used internet shutdowns, and China controls the flow of online information through an extensive firewall. However, analysts like Chima worry about the frequency of the shutdowns in India, which have risen sharply since Modi came to power. From January 2012   the date of the first shutdown recorded by the Software Freedom Law Centre (SFLC)   to May 2014, when the BJP swept out the ruling coalition headed by the Congress party, local and federal officials ordered 12 shutdowns. Since Modi s election, 89 shutdowns have been ordered, with 74 at the behest of his party or its allies at the central, state and district levels, an analysis of SFLC data showed. So far, the shutdowns have been met with little opposition, apart from frustration expressed by users like Madhok over the curtailing of online services.  There s been no outcry about the shutdowns because it s perceived to be for the greater good,  said Nitin Pai, the co-founder of the Takshashila Institution, a Bangalore think tank. Nalin Kohli, a national spokesman for the BJP, said the shutdowns were acceptable in cases  where rumor-mongering or motivated misinformation could lead to the incitement of violence.  He added:  It is not the norm, it is the exception.   In Jaipur, the shutdown lasted two days. But disconnections can last hours, weeks, and even months. In a June statement, Human Rights Watch said  the authorities in Jammu and Kashmir suspended mobile internet services in the Kashmir region from July to November  in 2016.  The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said the restrictions in the Kashmir region, where 100 people have died in clashes since troops killed a militant leader in July 2016, had  the character of collective punishment.  In 2016, Gupta, the lawyer, argued before India s Supreme Court on behalf of a law student who had earlier approached the Gujarat High Court to restrict internet shutdowns. The High Court disagreed, saying that officials used their powers responsibly. The Supreme Court declined to hear the matter, letting the high court s verdict stand. ",

        "title": "Congress readies votes Friday on bill to avert government shutdown",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is set to debate legislation that would extend until May 5 the deadline for a deal on federal spending through September and head off a feared government shutdown at midnight on Friday. The House Rules Committee, in a late-night meeting, voted 8-2 to send the legislation to the full House of Representatives for debate and votes on passage on Friday, just hours before expiry of a deadline for funding many federal agencies. If the measure passes the House, as expected, the Senate would be prepared to promptly take up the bill, in the hope of also passing it and sending it to President Donald Trump to be signed into law. The measure would give Republican and Democratic lawmakers an additional week to work out differences on about $1 trillion in funding for the government through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year. Without the extension or a longer-term funding bill, federal agencies will run out of money by midnight Friday, likely triggering abrupt layoffs of hundreds of thousands of federal government workers until funding resumes.  The last government shutdown, in 2013, lasted for 17 days, and many lawmakers were nervous about the prospect of another. \u201cI\u2019m confident we will be able to pass a short-term extension\u201d of funding for programs for the fiscal year that began nearly seven months ago, House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters early on Thursday. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi warned that the purpose of the stopgap measure was to tie up loose ends of a deal to provide around $1 trillion in money for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 and not for \u201ckicking the can down the road to have this same back-and-forth\u201d over funding disputes.   House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen expressed optimism in a statement that a final funding package will be completed soon. In the midst of the delicate negotiations, Trump took to social network Twitter to blast Democrats. \u201cAs families prepare for summer vacations in our National Parks - Democrats threaten to close them and shut down the government. Terrible!\u201d Trump tweeted in a series of tweets. Negotiators were racing against the clock to resolve remaining disputes in the massive spending bill amid talks that have already handed Democrats at least two major victories, despite Republican control of Congress.     Trump, a Republican, gave in to Democratic demands that the spending bill not include money to start building the wall he wants to erect on the U.S.-Mexico border. His administration also agreed to continue funding for a major component of Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, despite vows to end the program. It remained unclear whether Republicans would prevail in their effort to sharply hike defense spending without similar increases for other domestic programs. Trump has proposed a $30-billion spending boost for the Pentagon for the rest of this fiscal year. Such funding disputes could resurface later in spending bills for the next fiscal year. Disagreements remaining to be ironed out include funding to make a healthcare program for coal miners permanent and to plug a gap in Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicaid program, the government health insurance program for the poor.

        "text": "MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton cannot be in two places at once in the weeks before the first party-nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, but she came close on Tuesday with daughter Chelsea Clinton\u2019s campaign trail debut.  Hillary Clinton was in Iowa discussing how she would tax the wealthiest at a higher rate. Chelsea Clinton was in New Hampshire promoting her mother\u2019s positions on health care and student debt.  It was a day when multiple polls showed that Clinton\u2019s lead over her chief challenger, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has eroded in Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold their nominating contests on Feb. 1 and Feb. 9. A Quinnipiac University poll showed that Sanders has climbed to 49 percent in Iowa, with a 5 percentage point lead over Clinton. A Monmouth University poll showed Sanders had widened his lead in New Hampshire by 14 points. The polls had an error margin of 4.4 and 4.8 points, respectively. Chelsea Clinton, 35, highlighted how her mother differs from Sanders, acting as a surrogate to woo younger voters with whom he is particularly popular. At a stop in Manchester, Sarah Odell, a teacher at a girls\u2019 boarding school in Connecticut, asked why young people should support the former secretary of state. Chelsea Clinton said Sanders wants to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act and pursue a single-payer system at a time when the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress is intent on undermining President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law. \u201cI worry that if we give Republicans Democratic permission to do that,\u201d Clinton told Odell, \u201cthat will strip millions, millions and millions of people of their health insurance.\u201d At a women\u2019s event in Portsmouth, Clinton said that another important difference are plans to deal with educational debt. Sanders has said he wants to make higher education free; Clinton has focused on making it more affordable for the poor and middle class. \u201cShe has actually articulated how she is going to pay for all of this, which is a big distinction between her and her main opponent,\u201d Clinton said. Clinton took questions on the resettlement of the West Bank, cost-of-living adjustments for fixed-income retirees, Wall Street reform and autism, sprinkling anecdotes about baby daughter Charlotte, whom Hillary Clinton often mentions. At times her diction was nearly identical to her mother\u2019s. \u201cIt is important to stand your ground, but it is important to find common ground,\u201d Clinton said, echoing a popular campaign-trail riff about bipartisanship.

        "title": "Trump national security aide Flynn resigns over Russian contacts",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned late on Monday after revelations that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Flynn\u2019s resignation came hours after it was reported that the Justice Department had warned the White House weeks ago that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail for contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump took power on Jan. 20. Flynn\u2019s departure was a sobering development in Trump\u2019s young presidency, a 24-day period during which his White House has been repeatedly distracted by miscues and internal dramas. The departure could slow Trump\u2019s bid to warm up relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Flynn submitted his resignation hours after Trump, through a spokesman, pointedly declined to publicly back Flynn, saying he was reviewing the situation and talking to Pence. Flynn had promised Pence he had not discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russians, but transcripts of intercepted communications, described by U.S. officials, showed that the subject had come up in conversations between him and the Russian ambassador. Such contacts could potentially be in violation of a law banning private citizens from engaging in foreign policy, known as the Logan Act. Pence had defended Flynn in television interviews and was described by administration officials as upset about being misled. \u201cUnfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology,\u201d Flynn said in his resignation letter. Retired General Keith Kellogg, who has been chief of staff of the White House National Security Council, was named the acting national security adviser while Trump determines who should fill the position. Kellogg, retired General David Petraeus, a former CIA director, and Robert Harward, a former deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, are under consideration for the position, a White House official said. Harward was described by officials as the leading candidate. A U.S. official confirmed a Washington Post report that Sally Yates, the then-acting U.S. attorney general, told the White House late last month that she believed Flynn had misled them about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador. She said Flynn might have put himself in a compromising position, possibly leaving himself vulnerable to blackmail, the official said. Yates was later fired for opposing Trump\u2019s temporary entry ban for people from seven mostly Muslim nations. A U.S. official, describing the intercepted communications, said Flynn did not make any promises about lifting the sanctions. But he did indicate that sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama on Russia for its Ukraine incursion \u201cwould not necessarily carry over to an administration seeking to improve relations between the U.S. and Russia,\u201d the official said. Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, was an early supporter of Trump and shares his interest in shaking up the establishment in Washington. He frequently raised eyebrows among Washington\u2019s foreign policy establishment for trying to persuade Trump to warm up U.S. relations with Russia.   A U.S. official said Flynn\u2019s departure, coupled with Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and Syria and Republican congressional opposition to removing sanctions on Russia, removes Trump\u2019s most ardent advocate of taking a softer line toward Putin. Flynn\u2019s leaving \u201cmay make a significant course change less likely, at least any time soon,\u201d the official said. Another official said Flynn\u2019s departure may strengthen the hands of some cabinet secretaries, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. However, the second official said, Flynn\u2019s exit could also reinforce the power of presidential aides Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, whom he described as already having the president\u2019s ear. Congressional Democrats expressed alarm at the developments  surrounding Flynn and called for a classified briefing by administration officials to explain what had happened. \u201cWe are communicating this request to the Department of Justice and FBI this evening,\u201d said Democratic representatives John Conyers of Michigan and Elijah Cummings of Maryland. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff of California, ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Flynn\u2019s departure does not end the questions over his contacts with the Russians. \u201cThe Trump administration has yet to be forthcoming about who was aware of Flynn\u2019s conversations with the ambassador and whether he was acting on the instructions of the president or any other officials, or with their knowledge,\u201d Schiff said. The committee\u2019s chairman, Republican Devin Nunes, thanked Flynn for his service. \u201cWashington D.C. can be a rough town for honorable people, and Flynn \u2014 who has always been a soldier, not a politician \u2014deserves America\u2019s gratitude and respect,\u201d he said.

Valentino Talluto, a 33-year-old accountant, seduced dozens of women via social networks for a decade before his arrest in November 2015. Police believe he had sex with at least 53 women during that time, passing on the virus to 32 of them. The male partners of three of the women subsequently contracted the potentially fatal illness, as did an eight-month-old infant of a fourth woman. Talluto often found an excuse not to wear a condom, telling his partners that he was allergic to them, or had just had an HIV test, the court in Rome heard.  He expressed regret for what had happened, but said he did not realize the consequences of his actions.  Prosecutors had urged the court to give him life in jail, saying he had provoked an HIV epidemic. The court rejected this, convicting him instead of  grievous and incurable bodily harm . Many of the women only discovered they had HIV after they heard of Talluto s arrest and had a test. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has killed around 35 million people worldwide since it began in the 1980s. ",

        "text": "BARCELONA (Reuters) - The first of hundreds of Catalan mayors summoned to answer questions on why they have backed a banned Oct. 1 referendum on independence from Spain appeared before the state prosecutor on Tuesday amid cheers and chants from supporters. The first three mayors to declare exercised their right to remain silent, the Association of Municipalities for Independence (AMI) said. Years of separatist feeling in the industrial northeastern region will come to a head in less than two weeks as the fiercely pro-independence regional government calls a referendum on splitting from Spain. Madrid has declared the referendum illegal and the Constitutional Court has suspended the vote that was approved by the regional government earlier this month. On Tuesday, police continued their search for ballot boxes, voting papers and campaign leaflets, raiding the offices of Spain s biggest private delivery company Unipost in several Catalan cities and clashing with protesters. So far, 745 of 948 municipal leaders have said they will provide venues for the referendum.  Voting is not a crime,  said Marc Solsona, mayor of the town of Mollerussa, one of nearly 750 mayors facing charges of civil disobedience, abuse of office and misuse of public funds, as he left the state prosecutor s office in Barcelona.  I m just the mayor and I have to serve my people. I am committed to the people being able to vote on Oct. 1 in accordance with the law passed by the Catalan parliament and what happens to me is not important,  he said. Solsona smiled, kissed and gripped hands with dozens of clapping supporters gathered outside the state prosecutor s office as he entered to chants of  You are not alone .  We consider ourselves privileged to have a mayor who represents the townspeople above any other interests - political or financial,  said 63-year-old pensioner Angel Tena, who had traveled to Barcelona to support the mayor. Spain s Civil Guard, a national police force, on Tuesday seized over 45,000 envelopes packed in cardboard boxes that the Catalan government was ready to send to notify people around the region about the referendum, the Spanish interior ministry said. While police raided the Unipost offices in Terrassa, dozens of people gathered outside chanting  Out with the occupying forces,  handing out voting papers, flying Catalan flags, and laying carnations on police cars. Later on protesters scuffled with Catalan police called in to move protesters preventing the Civil Guard from leaving the premises, according to Reuters footage. The police hit several protesters outside the offices with truncheons. Unipost confirmed the raid without giving further details. Although polls show less than half of Catalonia s 5.5 million voters want self-rule, most in the wealthy northeastern region want the chance to vote on the issue. ",

Sharif was ousted in July after the Supreme Court deemed him unfit to hold office for not declaring a small source of income, and ordered the agency, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), to instigate a criminal investigation into him, his family and Dar. The agency said its investigation would rely on the evidence collected by a Supreme Court-appointed six-man panel that was investigating the Sharif family s wealth and included officers from powerful military intelligence agencies.  The chairman (of) NAB directed that the prosecution of the cases will be followed up vigorously in the concerned Accountability Courts,  the agency said in a statement. Sharif, his family, and Dar have denied any wrongdoing.  The three-time premier said he never received the income that investigators said he did not declare.  Sharif has said there was a conspiracy against him but did not identify anyone. Instead, he named long-time loyalist Shahid Khaqan Abbasi as his replacement as prime minister until the next election, expected in mid-2018. Pakistan has for decades been plagued by pervasive graft, as well as by rivalry between the military and civilian politicians.

        "title": "FBI director search: back to drawing board for Trump team?",
        "text": " (This version of the May 24 story corrects paragraph 9 to add reference to White House waiver) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A week after President Donald Trump said he was close to picking a new FBI director to replace the one he fired, the White House has decided to renew its search, CNN reported on Wednesday. The Republican president said last Thursday he was \u201cvery close\u201d to selecting a new head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to replace James Comey, and that former Senator Joseph Lieberman was among the top candidates. Trump left the following day on his first trip abroad as president, a nine-day visit to the Middle East and Europe, without naming a replacement.  Citing an unidentified senior administration official, CNN said Trump now wants to consider additional candidates for the job. The White House and Lieberman did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the Justice Department, which has played a lead role in the search, said it had no further information. Trump fired Comey on May 9 in a surprise announcement that sparked days of political turmoil. Comey was leading the FBI\u2019s probe of possible collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian operatives whom U.S. intelligence officials say meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump and Russia deny any collusion. Lieberman is a senior counsel at the New York-based law firm of Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, which has represented Trump on various matters for years.  Trump has tapped one of the firm\u2019s partners, Marc Kasowitz, to be his private attorney while a special counsel investigates whether his presidential campaign worked with Russia to defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. If Trump were to nominate Lieberman, Lieberman might not have been able to participate in the Russia investigation for a period of two years without White House and Justice Department waivers, according to Kathleen Clark, a professor of legal ethics at Washington University School of Law. A federal regulation restricts newly hired government lawyers from investigating their prior law firm\u2019s clients for one year. This cooling-off period was extended to two years by an executive order Trump signed in January. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said last Wednesday that Trump was scheduled to interview four candidates for the position before departing on his trip: Lieberman; acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe; former Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating; and former senior FBI official Richard McFeely.

        "text": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has ordered 27 international aid groups to shut down for working in unauthorized areas, spurring human rights campaigners to denounce swelling constraints on free speech and humanitarian work.  The Ministry of Interior gave the 27 NGOs 90 days to conclude operations, according to a list seen by Reuters. Among those being expelled are Action Aid, World Vision, Plan International, Trocaire, Pathfinder International, Danish Refugee Council, George Soros  Open Society Foundations, Oxfam Novib, and Marie Stopes.   Talal Chaudhry, Pakistan s Minister of State for Interior Affairs, told Reuters the reason for shutting down the NGOs was because they were doing work in Pakistan  which is beyond their mandate and for which they have no legal justification .  He declined to give specific examples, but said the targeted NGOs spend  all their money  on administration, are not doing the work they said they were doing, and are working in areas where they were not authorized. The Pakistan Humanitarian Forum (PHF), which represents 63 international aid groups, said the ministry had issued 11 of its members  letters of rejection . All of them said they will appeal. No reason for the rejections have been provided, the forum said. Plan International, which has worked in Pakistan since 1997, said it is supporting over 1.6 million children across Pakistan. Plan said it was given no reason for the ministry s decision and would appeal it.  The organization is hopeful that the appeals process will make it possible for its work with vulnerable and marginalized children, especially girls, to continue in Pakistan,  it said in a statement.  All the other NGOs on the list who responded to queries from Reuters also said they had been given no reason for being forced to shut down.  They must be having reasons for every (NGO) and those reasons should have been shared with the organizations,  said a representative from one NGO who declined to be identified. Chaudhry said the number of NGOs in the country ballooned after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. Many organizations arrived to provide humanitarian assistance after Islamabad allied itself with the United States in what was then known as the global war on terror.  But there were also a number of NGOs that are used, knowingly or unknowingly for activities that conflict with Pakistan s national interests,  Chaudhry said, adding that registration procedures are commonplace in other countries. Pakistan has hardened its stance towards domestic and international NGOs in recent years, requiring them to undertake a painstaking registration process and clear multiple bureaucratic hurdles to continue working in the country. The Save the Children aid group fell afoul of the government in 2011, when it was linked to a Pakistani doctor recruited by the CIA to help in the hunt that led to the killing of al Qaeda militant leader Osama bin Laden in the town of Abbottabad. In January, the interior ministry ordered a dozen domestic groups working on women s issues and human rights to halt operations, a move later overturned in courts. Pakistan is hardly alone in cracking down on foreign charities.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi s government has since 2014 tightened surveillance of non-profit groups, saying they were acting against India s national interests. Thousands of foreign-funded charities  licenses have been canceled for misreporting donations. In China, a law that went into effect on Jan. 1 this year grants broad powers to police to question NGO workers, monitor their finances, regulate their work and shut down offices. The clampdown on NGOs has come after a number of activists disappeared this year, some of whom have not been heard from. Reuters estimates at least 14 people have been picked up and interrogated from major urban centers including journalists, political workers, and social media activists. Three members of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) have also disappeared in the past year, chairperson Mehdi Hasan told Reuters.  Human rights campaigners say the crackdown on NGOs and  disappearances of civil society activists are part of a wider campaign to quell free speech.   They both signify the shrinking space for free expression and activism in Pakistan and the diminishing tolerance the Pakistan state has,  Saroop Ijaz, a representative for the Pakistan chapter of Human Rights Watch, told Reuters.  Yusuf, who formerly served as HRCP chairperson, said Pakistan feels it has impunity in dealing with rights groups and activists.    Its the repositioning of Pakistan as a security state and perceiving all forms of dissent as a security challenge,  Yusuf said.   It s creating a lot of fear in society.  ",

        "title": "Trump seeks help of insurers to smooth Obamacare transition",
        "text": "NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump sought on Monday to bring the nation\u2019s largest insurance companies on board with his plans to overhaul Obamacare, saying their help was needed to deliver a smooth transition to the Republicans\u2019 new plan. \u201cWe must work together to save Americans from Obamacare \u2013 you people know that and everyone knows that - to create more competition and to bring down prices substantially,\u201d Trump told insurers at a meeting at the White House. The gathering took place a day before Trump was to deliver a major policy speech to the U.S. Congress. In attendance at the meeting were insurers who participate in the Obamacare health insurance exchanges as well as some that have pulled most or all of their Obamacare individual insurance offerings. The president needs insurers to participate in the individual insurance market to keep up competition and keep costs in check. The speech to Congress is a chance for Trump to elaborate on his healthcare policy, one of his top domestic priorities. Trump and Republicans have vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature piece of domestic policy, but have not released details yet. Trump told the insurers that his changes would include expanded healthcare savings accounts, which are tax-free savings accounts typically used with high-deductible insurance plans, and the sale of health plans across state lines. He also said that he wanted states to have more flexibility but did not provide details. Trump previously discussed these ideas on the campaign trail. It is unclear how they would be implemented, or what changes he might make to Medicaid expansion, another key component of the Obamacare law. Trump told insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc, Anthem Inc and Aetna Inc, that he was directing Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price to work with them \u201cto ensure a smooth transition to the new plan.\u201d The administration recently granted the insurers one of their biggest requests and proposed a rule that would tighten eligibility verification for subsidized plans and allow them to seek unpaid premiums. Trump is also seeking support from the nation\u2019s governors for changes. The Obamacare law, which extended health insurance to 20 million Americans, has been popular in many states, even those controlled by Republicans. But it has also been criticized for its steep premium increases. At a meeting with Trump and governors on Sunday, Price said he expected to have a new healthcare plan in three to four weeks, to which Trump responded he hoped to see a plan in two weeks, said Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.  Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval said many conversations during this weekend\u2019s meeting of the National Governors Association centered on Medicaid, the massive government health insurance program for the poor, and how to ensure those who received coverage under the Medicaid expansion could maintain coverage. Trump said on Monday that he wanted to win support from Democrats for the plan. McAuliffe, a Democrat, said it would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for Republicans to repeal Obamacare without a proper replacement. \u201cThe political rhetoric of the campaign has hit the reality of governing,\u201d he said.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican White House hopeful Ted Cruz said on Wednesday he is looking at who he might select as his vice presidential running mate should he become the party\u2019s presidential nominee, and that he thinks highly of former rival Marco Rubio. Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, appeared on a CNN town hall with his wife, Heidi, and two daughters and showed a more personal side. He trails front-runner Donald Trump in the race to get 1,237 delegates to seal the nomination, but he expressed confidence he can emerge as the winner if he can chip away at Trump\u2019s lead and force Republicans to pick their nominee at a contested convention in July. Cruz said he and his team are looking at possible vice presidential running mates. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process now of looking at a number of different options,\u201d said Cruz without mentioning names. Asked about Rubio, Cruz called him an \u201camazing communicator\u201d who inspired millions across the country in his presidential campaign. \u201cI consider Marco a friend,\u201d said Cruz, adding that \u201canyone would naturally look at Marco\u201d for the No. 2 position on the Republican ticket. Cruz and Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida, engaged in bitter fights over illegal immigration during the campaign. Rubio was forced from the race after losing the Florida Republican primary on March 15. Cruz said they have now put those differences behind them. The town hall included some exchanges that were aimed at showing what Cruz is like at home. Heidi Cruz said that shortly after they were married, her husband once brought home 100 cans of soup, a haul that was so big she took them back. Asked if he had ever not followed his wife\u2019s advice, Cruz said he could not remember any examples, but Heidi Cruz had a ready response for him. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t take out the trash when I ask you to,\u201d she said.

        "title": "Italian parliament passes 2018 budget, clearing way for elections",
        "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italy s upper house Senate on Saturday gave parliament s final approval to the government s 2018 budget, clearing the way for national elections expected to be held in March. The financial law, which had already passed in the Chamber of Deputies, aims to lower next year s fiscal deficit to 1.6 percent of gross domestic product from a targeted 2.1 percent this year. It also introduces a  web tax  from 2019, obliging companies to pay a three percent levy on some Internet transactions. The Senate passed the package in a vote of confidence by 140 votes to 97. Confidence votes allow the government to speed up legislation by curtailing debate on proposed amendments.  If the government loses such a vote it has to resign, but with elections in any case imminent no parties had any real interest in scuppering the budget and bringing down Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni s administration. President Sergio Mattarella is expected to dissolve parliament before the end of the year, after which the government will set the date of the election. Politicians often tout March 4 as the most likely date. The European Commission says the budget may break EU rules because it raises previously agreed deficit targets and does too little to rein in Italy s huge public debt.  At just over 130 percent of national output, Italy s debt is the highest in the euro zone after that of Greece. Brussels will issue a final verdict on the budget in the spring, after the Italian election which opinion polls suggest will produce a hung parliament. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement leads in the polls, with around 28 percent of the vote, but a center-right coalition of parties is seen winning most seats in parliament. The ruling Democratic Party has been hit by internal divisions and lags 5-Star by around four points in most polls.       ",

        "text": "CLEVELAND (Reuters) - East 4th Street, emblematic of the new Cleveland as a once-downtrodden area turned trendy, is bustling ahead of the Republican National Convention. Outdoor diners on the cobblestone restaurant row enjoy a glorious summer afternoon while cable network MSNBC shoots its politically themed shows on the street.  Just ahead of the four-day convention that starts on Monday, a festival of commerce and smiling faces takes place a few steps from the so-called hard zone, delineated by a literal iron curtain that surrounds the sports arena where Donald Trump will be crowned the Republican presidential candidate. \u201cTen years ago, this place was a dump. A wasteland,\u201d said John Lusk, 70, a semiretired publisher of a newsletter. \u201cA group of young, hardworking entrepreneurs came in and look what they did.\u201d    The sunny celebration butts uncomfortably against a massive security operation that shows the other side of Cleveland\u2019s big moment. City and U.S. officials are preparing for the worst, aware that tensions over race relations and police use of force, as well as reaction to Trump\u2019s polarizing campaign, could result in violence on the streets. Clevelanders are also aware of the backdrop for their convention: the mass shooting in Orlando that killed 50 people in June, the sniper attack that killed five Dallas police this month, and the truck assault that killed 84 this week in Nice. On this same idyllic block just over a year ago, police in riot gear clashed with demonstrators reacting to the acquittal of police officer charged with manslaughter for firing 15 rounds into the car of an unarmed black man and woman, killing them both. More than 70 people were arrested, disturbing the al fresco dining experience on East 4th Street. Unrest also followed the fatal police shooting in 2014 of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, an African-American who had a toy gun, and the officer who shot him was not charged with a crime. Cleveland, a city of 390,000, has been revitalized in part by billions of dollars in infrastructure spending in recent years, but the black majority still lags behind. Black Lives Matter, the protest group formed after a series of police killings of African-Americans raised questions about justice in America, held a protest on Saturday in Public Square. It was entirely peaceful, with about 100 activists clapping to speeches. In between the civic protest and festival atmosphere, there are pockets of emptiness. Street closing and security cordons seem to have scared off customers at the Arcade, a late 1800s shopping mall that has been modernized. The ornate interior, illuminated by a skylight, is full of boutiques like Prosperity, which sells handcrafted art glass jewelry. Business is slow on a Saturday afternoon. \u201cA lot of people are afraid to come downtown,\u201d said Cat Zurchin, one of the artist/storeowners, from an empty shop.   \u201cSome of these stores opened up just for the convention. Retail people have been excited, but we also have some anxiety. The Secret Service is everywhere.\u201d Black SUVs have invaded the city center as the U.S. Secret Service has taken charge of security. Concrete median barriers and the tall, anti-scaling fence circumscribe the city into impenetrable sectors. A column of police ride through the city center on bicycles, a dozen more on horseback. Helicopters clatter overhead.  Cleveland police are trying to stay restrained, avoiding the militarized presence that has become common thanks to free war surplus equipment from the Pentagon. Even so, the city\u2019s courts are preparing to process up to 1,000 arrestees per day, ready to stay open 20 hours a day.  Hospitals are bracing for the worst. The Cleveland Clinic, one of the largest hospitals in the country, will have 50 doctors, nurses and other medical personnel at the convention site and its entire staff on standby. If needed the hospital can take over an adjoining hotel and conference center, enabling it to handle 1,000 general trauma cases. The hospital is prepared to operate without reinforcements for 96 hours. \u201cAll boots on the ground,\u201d said Dr. Robert Willie, chief of medical operations.     Likewise, the Secret Service says it can handle the spotlight. \u201cWe are prepared,\u201d said Ronald Rowe, the agent in charge of the convention, \u201cand ready to welcome the world to Cleveland.\u201d ",

        "title": "Some middle-class Americans worry Trump health subsidies cut will hurt",
        "text": " PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Tom Westerman voted for Donald Trump in last year\u2019s election but says he might not do so again after the president cut off billions of dollars in Obamacare subsidies to health insurance companies.  \u201cIt really upset me,\u201d said Westerman, 63, a self-described \u201cmiddle-class guy\u201d with an annual household income of about $60,000 in the western Pennsylvania city of Arnold.  Westerman\u2019s change of heart reflects mounting fears among middle-class Democrats and Republicans that their health insurance costs will soar as Trump weakens former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law, which extended insurance to more than 20 million Americans.  Trump said last week he would stop paying the monthly subsidies, which he has derided as a bailout of insurers. The money reimburses insurers for discounts on deductibles, copays and other out-of-pocket costs the firms still must provide under Obamacare to low-income households.  Some insurers, anticipating that Trump would end the funding, had already raised 2018 premiums on insurance plans under Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act to recoup those funds. Others withdrew from Obamacare markets in many states because of the uncertainty.  \u201cIt seems like he is trying to hurt the middle class,\u201d said Westerman, who is retired from a manufacturing company in Pennsylvania, a state that Trump won by little more than 44,000 votes over Democrat Hillary Clinton. It was the first time a Republican candidate had won Pennsylvania since 1988.  Westerman already pays $520 a month in healthcare premiums and about $700 a month for his 21-year-old daughter\u2019s college tuition. \u201cHe says he\u2019s going to make it better for everyone. How does a (premium) increase make it better?\u201d  A White House spokesman declined to comment and referred inquiries to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trump has called subsidy payments a \u201cgift\u201d for insurance companies. His administration has argued that it cannot lawfully make the payments unless Congress passes new legislation.  Some people said they were encouraged to see Trump deliver on a campaign promise to dismantle Obamacare, after repeated failures by congressional Republicans to repeal the 2010 law.  \u201cI support the president because I think Obamacare is imploding and it not only impacts those on Obamacare, but everybody,\u201d said Roger Heuring, 58, who lives in New Jersey. Heuring is on an employer plan but said his sister in Ohio buys insurance on the Obamacare market.  \u201cForget the president \u2013 it\u2019s the Congress\u2019s responsibility. They\u2019re the ones that passed this mess to begin with,\u201d Heuring said.  In addition to cutting subsidies, Trump signed an executive order last week that could eventually make it easier for Americans to buy cheaper, bare-bones health insurance plans than required by Obamacare.  On Tuesday, two senators struck a bipartisan deal to stabilize the Obamacare market, including reinstating the subsidies for two years. Trump initially said he might back the deal, but reversed course on Wednesday, as senior Republican lawmakers spoke out against a plan that might allow Obamacare to survive.  Meanwhile, Democratic attorneys-general have asked a California judge to intervene and direct the administration to continue the payments until their legal challenge to Trump\u2019s cutoff is settled in court.  The moves created new uncertainty over the subsidies, just two weeks before Americans begin to enroll in Obamacare plans for 2018.  MIDDLE-CLASS SQUEEZE  If the subsidies are not restored, some middle-income families and small business owners who buy insurance on the Obamacare markets could see their premiums rise the most, said Larry Levitt, health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation.  These include cash-strapped self-employed workers who rely on Obamacare to buy insurance but make too much money to qualify for government assistance. The very poor receive other forms of government subsidies to buy coverage that shields them from premium increases.  Karyn Feit, a self-employed mental health therapist in Philadelphia, said a hike in premiums will strain her already-stretched finances and force her to cut back on trips to Florida to care for sick parents.  Feit, 47, and her husband together earn $100,000 annually, placing her among America\u2019s vast tier of middle-income families. They bought Obamacare individual coverage four years ago, when Feit left her job at a hospital to start her own business, leaving her without employer coverage. She has no children.  Her current monthly premiums are $391. She expects this to rise by $80 a month after Trump\u2019s decision.  \u201cThe first thing I would have to cut is travel, and caring for other people,\u201d said Feit, a Democrat.  Trump voter Stephen Lewis, 62, lost his job as a veterinarian in Wisconsin and bought a health insurance plan under Obamacare. Lewis still supports Trump although he said he fears that his premiums, now $309 a month, could rise further with the subsidy cut, making it harder for him to meet other expenses, including $611 in monthly mortgage payments.  \u201cIt is a concern obviously,\u201d Lewis said.

        "title": "Factbox: What is in Obama's final budget proposal?",
        "text": "(Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday unveiled his budget proposal for fiscal year 2017, his final year in office.  But since the Republican-controlled Congress controls the purse strings, much of Obama\u2019s plan likely will be shelved and so it is primarily a political document. The following are some of Obama\u2019s proposals: The Pentagon asked for $7.5 billion to fight Islamic State, up 50 percent from the amount received in the previous year\u2019s budget, and wants a fourfold increase for military training and exercises in Europe to support NATO allies.  Citing online threats as a top concern, Obama sought $19 billion to boost cyber security across the U.S. government, a $5 billion increase over the current fiscal year. In a long-shot bid to raise $20 billion to expand transit systems and research self-driving cars, Obama proposed a $10.25-a-barrel tax on crude oil.   Obama sought a 20 percent boost for renewable energy research funding to a total of $7.7 billion. Obama proposed a tax credit for businesses that invest in community college programs and then hire their graduates. The White House asked for $1.8 billion in emergency funding. Some Republicans argue Obama might have enough in existing funds for now.  Obama sought an 11 percent hike in funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission to $1.8 billion, and 32 percent increase for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to $330 million. Obama asked for $1 billion to fund a two-year effort to expand treatment for people addicted to heroin and prescription painkillers.  Obama proposed $12.2 billion over 10 years to supplement food stamps for poor families when school meal programs are closed in the summer and a $15 million pilot program to help poor families move to better neighborhoods, among other aid. The earned income tax credit for low-income taxpayers would be doubled to a maximum of about $1,022 a year. It would be expanded to cover workers with earnings up to 150 percent of the poverty line and to cover single workers ages 21-24. The budget includes three years of federal funding to states that passed up an earlier offer to expand Medicaid healthcare coverage for low-income people. Obama proposed changes to certain high-cost health insurance plans. The White House asked for $5.5 billion in incentives for businesses that hire young people and setting aside $200 million for youth from a $2 billion apprenticeship fund. Obama proposed $4 billion for states and $100 million for school districts to expand computer science in schools. The White House sought $755 million for Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cmoonshot\u201d effort to find new cancer treatments. Obama proposed $500 million for a two-year initiative to boost access to mental healthcare as part of his push to address gun violence. As part of criminal justice system reforms, Obama asked for $24 million to review the use of restrictive housing, or solitary confinement, and expand mental health programs. Obama proposed tax credits for small businesses offering 401(k) plans or expanding access to retirement savings programs, while setting aside $6.5 million for some states to explore state-based programs.  Military and civilian federal personnel would see a 1.6 percent pay increase. Obama asked for funding to hire 200 new ATF staff to enforce gun laws. ",

        "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday said an almost two-month pause in North Korean missile tests was no indication that it had halted its weapons development, insisting it was too early for any talks with the regime.  I believe that it continues to develop its weapons,  Abe told a news conference in Manila after a series of meetings with other Asian leaders at a gathering of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and East Asia Forum.   There is no point for talks for the sake of talks,  he said. Abe s insistence that tough sanctions, including restrictions on oil sales, are necessary to soften up the North Korean regime over the coming winter could put him at loggerheads with other countries such as South Korea that might agree to open talks if approached by the North. After firing missiles at a pace of about two or three a month since April, North Korean missile launches paused in September, after it fired a rocket that passed over Japan s northern Hokkaido island. Abe said he would work closely with other countries in the region including China and Russia to persuade North Korea to halt missile development and give up its nuclear weapon ambitions. Abe, in a meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping at an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam on Saturday, hailed a  fresh start  to the relationship between Asia s two biggest economies and military powers, including cooperation on North Korea. Abe on Tuesday said that he wanted to deepen cultural and economic ties with China. The Japanese leader, who also called for an Indo-Pacific region that is  open and free to all  returns to Japan on Wednesday.    ",

        "title": "California Assembly passes gun control bills",
        "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The California Assembly on Wednesday passed a package of gun control bills, including a measure to ban so-called bullet buttons which allow quick changes in the magazine of a military-style weapon. The bills, which lawmakers are pushing the Senate to consider this month, are among several gun control measures that leaders of both houses want to pass in advance of a gun control referendum headed for the November ballot.  The measures include a ban on so-called bullet buttons which supporters say allow gun manufacturers to bypass the state\u2019s prohibition on removable ammunition magazines. Weapons owned by the shooters in December\u2019s San Bernardino massacre were equipped with bullet buttons. The bill passed on the same day that the University of California, Los Angeles campus was shut down in the wake of a murder-suicide shooting.  Also passed was a bill to allow employers, co-workers, mental health workers and school employees to ask a judge to ban someone from possessing a gun for up to a year. The state already allows family members to seek such a ban, known as a gun violence restraining order, against relatives whom a judge rules are at high risk of committing violence against themselves or others with a firearm. A spokesman for the Firearms Policy Coalition was not immediately available for comment.      Last month, the California State Senate passed its own package of bills, which would prohibit possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines, require greater scrutiny of ammunition purchasers and seek to better keep guns out of the hands of violent felons. Led by Senate Democratic leader Kevin de Leon, California senators are rushing to pass the gun control bills in part to defuse a ballot initiative on the same subject backed by Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. Democrats in the Legislature fear that Newsom\u2019s measure, a centerpiece of his campaign so far, along with an initiative to legalize marijuana, will draw Republicans who oppose gun control to the polls, potentially influencing other races. De Leon, who has not endorsed Newsom or announced his own plans for 2018, has said he believes that laws passed by the Legislature are more nuanced and easily adjustable than those instead created through a referendum. Second amendment advocates have steadfastly opposed all of the measures. ",

        "title": "Scenting power, potential Merkel coalition partners edge closer on Europe",
        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Nominally, they are at odds on Europe. But Germany s Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP) gave remarkably similar messages on European reform on Monday as they began exploring a coalition alliance with Chancellor Angela Merkel s humbled conservatives. After her conservative bloc hemorrhaged support to the far-right in Sunday s election, Merkel has little choice but to try to work out a three-way coalition with the Greens and FDP - an tie-up untested at national level and widely seen as risky. If their party programs are taken at face value, the Greens want to press ahead with deeper European integration and the FDP wants to hold it back - a conflict that could frustrate coalition talks with Merkel, who wants a  stronger Europe . But at back-to-back news conferences on Monday, the FDP and Greens both made conciliatory noises toward French President Emmanuel Macron, who ran for the French presidency on a pledge to  relaunch  the European Union in tandem with Germany. Macron is due to set out his proposals for EU reform and strengthening monetary union on Tuesday.  We have a great interest in the success of the French republic and in its strength,  FDP leader Christian Lindner told a news conference.   Germany will not become stronger if France becomes weaker, but Europe will profit as a whole if all its members return to a path of economic success. That is why we wish Mr. Macron all the best.  Less than an hour later, Greens co-leader Cem Ozdemir delivered almost exactly the same message.  It is clear that we have a vital interest in France being successful,  he said. The headline comments glossed over deeper differences between the two parties on Europe, but indicated a  glass half full  attitude suggesting both want to find common ground on Europe that will help them forge a ruling coalition with Merkel. Both the FDP and Greens played down the prospect of such a three-way bloc during the election campaign, but as they have been out of government for four and 12 years respectively, they may be lured into an alliance by the prospect of power. Pledging to form a stable government, Merkel herself said she would not set out red lines on Europe policy for now - an open-minded approach that gives the three parliamentary groups wiggle room to work out a compromise.  My view is that we can use more Europe but this has to lead to more competitiveness, more jobs and more clout for the European Union,  she said in a message that could appeal to the pro-business FDP and the Greens, who are keener on regulation.  Merkel also urged the center-left Social Democrats not to shut the door on a re-run of their  grand coalition . The Greens and Free Democrats are from opposition ends of the political spectrum and must navigate differences on tax policy and immigration, as well as Europe, before they team up.  In their party program the Greens say they reject a division of Europe. The FDP, by contrast, favors a  multi-speed Europe  - differentiating a northern core of fiscally disciplined, wealthy member states from the rest.  The FDP wants euro zone countries to be able to leave the bloc rather than stay under an  interminable rescue policy , and favors winding down the lending capacity of the euro zone s ESM rescue fund - unlike Merkel s finance minister, who has proposed developing it into a European monetary fund. Lindner, who said during the election campaign that Greece should leave the euro, said on Monday his party could not agree to a common euro zone budget that would help redress economic imbalances within the bloc. That position seems to be at odds with the vision presented by Macron, who wants to overhaul the euro zone and introduce a budget and finance minister for the single-currency region. The euro EUR= snapped a two-day rising streak on Monday after a surge in support for the far right in the election prompted investors to lock in gains in one of the most profitable currency trades of the year. But investors remained sanguine about the prospects for European reform under a three-way coalition of conservatives, FDP and Greens - known as a  Jamaica  alliance after their respective party colors: black, yellow and green.  Where the FDP might push back on the next potential government s European policies, expect the Greens to pull forward, enabling Chancellor Merkel s middle-ground to prevail,  said Andrew Bosomworth, a senior portfolio manager at Pimco, one of the world s largest bond funds.

        "title": "Trump criticism prompts questions over Attorney General's future",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump further stoked speculation about the fate of his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, on Wednesday by assailing him in a fresh round of tweets even as Sessions was attending meetings at the White House. On Tuesday, Trump took to Twitter to call Sessions \u201cvery weak,\u201d prompting questions about whether Sessions, one of Trump\u2019s earliest and most vocal supporters during his 2016 presidential campaign, would be forced out. On Wednesday, Sessions entered and left the White House  without speaking to the president and with his status unchanged, while conservative lawmakers in Congress rallied around Sessions, a former senator. A source close to Sessions said he has a \u201cspine of steel\u201d and plans on remaining in office until he is fired or asked to resign. Trump has kept Sessions at a distance, the source said. The two rarely speak and Sessions has been kept out of meetings.  Trump has said he is frustrated that Sessions recused himself from a federal investigation into possible collusion between Trump\u2019s election campaign and Russia and said he would not have appointed him had he known he would do so. At a White House press briefing, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders did not address Sessions\u2019 job security, but said that Trump and Sessions had not spoken this week. \u201cYou can be disappointed in someone but still want them to continue to do their job,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe president wants the attorney general to focus on his duties as attorney general.\u201d In a pair of morning tweets, Trump said Sessions should have named a replacement for Andrew McCabe, the acting director of the FBI. Trump has accused McCabe of having ties to his former presidential rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton. The FBI has defended McCabe, saying he did not have conflicts of interests. Trump has since nominated Christopher Wray to be the FBI director. Wray is waiting to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  At a news conference on Tuesday, Trump said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with Sessions. Asked whether Sessions would remain in the cabinet, Trump said, \u201cTime will tell.\u201d     But Republicans on Capitol Hill and conservative groups have stood by the attorney general.  Senator Lindsey Graham said Trump was acting weak by not following through and firing Sessions. \u201cI would fire somebody I did not believe could serve me well rather than trying to humiliate them in public - which is a sign of weakness,\u201d Graham tweeted on Wednesday.  Earlier, Graham had praised Sessions as a \u201crock-solid conservative\u201d who \u201cbelieves in the rule of law.\u201d Sessions \u201cis working to keep our streets safe, secure our borders, and enforce our immigration laws, and protect our nation,\u201d Senator Tom Cotton said in a statement. Sessions\u2019 hardline stance on immigration endears him to conservatives. On Tuesday, the Justice Department said it would now withhold grant money from so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d - communities that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.  That move earned Sessions praise from NumbersUSA, a group that advocates limits on immigration. ",

        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) on Saturday dropped a controversial bid for data on the ethnic backgrounds and private views of journalists after concerns surfaced about its registration form for a party congress. The party s initial registration form had sparked sharp criticism on Friday from the German Journalists Association, and prompted an investigation by the Berlin data protection office. The party, which rails against what it calls the  Islamisation of Europe  and  fake news  coverage by mainstream news outlets, became the third largest force in the German Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, in Sept. 24 elections. AfD officials had declined to comment to the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper, which first reported the issue on Friday, and did not respond to a request for comment by Reuters. However the party s spokesman downplayed controversy about the issue in a posting on Twitter on Saturday.  Test version deleted. Starting immediately journalists can use the official registration form on our website,  AfD spokesman Christian Lueth wrote on Twitter. The initial media version had asked journalists to check a box in which they agreed to the collection, storage and use of personal data provided, such as name, medium and press pass number, as well as  special data . The form referenced a section in Germany s data protection law, which lists such  special data  as including racial and ethnic background, political views, religious or philosophical convictions, union membership, health or sexual orientation. Other parties require basic information for registration of journalists, but do not ask for such personal details.  This is an unacceptable intrusion into the private affairs of journalists,  said Hendrik Zoerner, spokesman for the German Journalists Association.  We call on the AfD to immediately remove the required agreement.  The AfD won nearly 13 percent of vote on Sept. 24, making it the third largest party in the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, and the first far-right group to move into the legislature in more than half a century.

        "title": "Vietnam's Facebook dissidents test the limits of Communist state",
        "text": "HANOI (Reuters) -  This isn t like China,  says Vietnamese activist  Anh Chi  at a noisy bar off one of the narrow streets of Hanoi s Old Quarter.  They can t shut Facebook down here.  His 40,000 Facebook followers make him one of Vietnam s better-known critics, but by no means the biggest in a Communist state whose attempts to crack down on dissidents have collided with the rapidly expanding reach of foreign-owned social media. Vietnam s President Tran Dai Quang this month called for unspecified tougher internet controls in the face of  hostile forces  that he said threatened not only cybersecurity but also  undermined the prestige of the leaders of the party and the state . But taming the internet in a young, fast-growing country is not easy, especially when the companies providing the platform are global. China, in contrast, allows only local internet companies operating under strict rules. Vietnam is among Facebook s top 10 countries, by number of members. It now reports more than 52 million active accounts to advertisers, according to research provided to Reuters by social media agencies We Are Social and Hootsuite. Google s YouTube and Twitter are popular too. As elsewhere in Southeast Asia, social media underpins business and communications as well as government critics. Some dissidents posting on social media have been caught in a major crackdown that has followed changes in the ruling party hierarchy. At least 15 people have been arrested this year. High profile bloggers Nguyen Ngoc Nhu Quynh, known as  Mother Mushroom , and Tran Thi Nga have been jailed for 10 and nine years respectively. Government critics also complain of beatings by unidentified assailants and intimidation. But dozens of activists still post critical comment every day. Several have more than 100,000 followers and at least one has over 400,000 - more than double that for the government s own Facebook page and nearly a 10th the size of the Communist Party s national membership.  We use any chance we have to raise our voice: environmental issues, territorial issues, land issues,  said  Anh Chi , 43, a Vietnamese teacher, translator and publisher whose real name is Nguyen Chi Tuyen. Vietnam tried to pressure Facebook (FB.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) to take down thousands items of anti-government content in March by leaning on advertisers, but the continued prevalence suggests limited success. One reason it is hard to take tougher action is business: From brewers to insurers to the makers of the motorbikes buzzing Vietnam s streets, social media is a key marketing route to young and increasingly affluent consumers in an economy growing at more than 6 percent a year, one of the fastest rates in Asia. For small businesses it is crucial: One new silk flower shop in Hanoi told Reuters 95 percent of customers found it through Facebook or Instagram.  You ve got kids that are building businesses on these platforms and generating significant success,  said Simon Kemp, founder of the Kepios marketing consultancy. While it accounts for only a tiny part of Facebook or Google parent Alphabet s revenue, Vietnam is a hot target for global consumer brands. Asia-Pacific was Facebook s fastest growing region by revenue last year, up nearly 60 percent. Tighter Internet controls could dampen innovation and impact the growth of Vietnam s digital economy and its competitiveness, said Jeff Paine, managing director of the Asia Internet Coalition, whose members include Facebook, Google and Twitter. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. Google declined to comment. Vietnam s foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told Reuters the government was an advocate of the internet but tried to minimize  behaviors that harm users and illegal acts such as inciting violence and a depraved lifestyle . China blocked Facebook in 2009 and only local sites such as WeChat and Weibo are permitted, operating under laws that ban content that is obscene, violent or offends the Communist Party.  China has had remarkable success controlling discussion,  said David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project and a fellow of the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin. Tools include keyword filtering by the local internet companies and the close monitoring of big networks, he said. Even so, China has said it is investigating its top social media sites for failing to comply with its laws. Facebook has been blocked in Vietnam occasionally - sometimes at sensitive moments - but never for long.  Vietnamese authorities have tried for years and so far failed to stop independent journalists and bloggers from using the internet,  said Shawn Crispin, Southeast Asia representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists.  It s a losing battle.  That does not stop activists being targeted for arrest. Activist Pham Doan Trang noted on Facebook that some campaigners appeared to have withdrawn from the scene in the face of the crackdown, but said she would not be discouraged.  Freedom has a very funny rule,  she told Reuters  Once people know the limit of freedom they will never go back.  ",

        "text": "MANILA (Reuters) - Leaders from across Asia joined U.S. President Donald Trump at an extravagant gala dinner in the Philippines\u2019 capital on Sunday, a show of amity in a region fraught with tensions that have lurked behind his marathon tour of the continent. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte set the tone of cordiality ahead of the two days of summit meetings he will host, suggesting that despite their differences over claims to the South China Sea, the leaders should not discuss the issue. \u201cWe have to be friends, the other hotheads would like us to confront China and the rest of the world on so many issues,\u201d Duterte said at a business conference, as planes carrying heads of state and government attending the summit landed in quick succession in Manila.  \u201cThe South China Sea is better left untouched, nobody can afford to go to war. It can ill-afford a violent confrontation.\u201d Hours earlier, during a bilateral visit to Vietnam, Trump offered to mediate in the dispute over the South China Sea, where four Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan contest China\u2019s sweeping claims to the busy waterway. All the claimants will be at the summit, except for Taiwan. Trump will join leaders of Southeast and East Asian nations in Manila over the next two days, the last leg of a tour that has taken him to Japan, South Korea and China as well as Vietnam. The sheer length of the trip - the longest to Asia by a U.S. president in more than a quarter century - may reassure some that, despite Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy, Washington remains committed to a region China sees as its strategic domain. Leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Russia, Japan, Canada, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand arrived one by one for a glitzy gala dinner where they were entertained by singers and dancers. Each of the men sported a cream-colored barong, a traditional Philippines shirt made of fiber from the pineapple plant, embroidered and worn untucked. They were served a four-course Filipino-Asian fusion meal curate and prepared by Chef Jessie Sincioco, who also designed the menu for Pope Francis when he visited the Philippines in 2015. Police used water canon to prevent hundreds of protesters reaching the U.S. embassy in Manila ahead of Trump\u2019s arrival. Carrying placards declaring \u201cDump Trump\u201d and \u201cDown with U.S. Imperialism\u201d, the left-wing protesters were blocked by police in riot gear with shields and batons, and then showered with jets of water from a fire engine. The United States and its former colony, the Philippines,  have been strategic allies since World War Two.  Trump is expected to try during the summit to shore up relations, which have been strained by the mercurial Duterte\u2019s notorious anti-U.S. sentiment and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China. Duterte - sometimes described as the \u2018Trump of the East\u2019 because of his brash style - said last week he would tell the U.S. president to \u201clay off\u201d if he raised the issue of human rights when they met. More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in what the police call self-defense in a war on drugs declared by Duterte. Critics say executions are taking place with no accountability, allegations the police reject. But Trump, who has been criticized at home for neglecting rights issues in dealings abroad, praised Duterte in May for doing an \u201cunbelievable job on the drug problem\u201d. \u201cINDO-PACIFIC\u201d Trump\u2019s tour comes against a background of tensions on the Korean peninsula following exchanges of war-like threats and insults between North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un and Trump over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and missile development program. China has been urged by both South Korea and the United States to take a more active role in curbing North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile ambitions. During his tour, Trump and his team have repeatedly used the term \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d instead of \u201cAsia-Pacific\u201d for the region, which some see as an effort to depict it as more than China-dominated. Pacific Rim nation leaders agreed in Vietnam on Saturday to address \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d and \u201cmarket distorting subsidies\u201d, a statement that bore the imprint of Trump\u2019s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape. The summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries in Vietnam put on show the contrasting vision of the \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy with the traditional consensus favoring multinational deals that China now seeks to champion. Manila hosted the APEC summit two years ago, and at that meeting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a Twitter poll with the hashtag #APEChottie that asked people to vote for the most attractive leader there. Journalists swarmed the youthful leader and screamed in excitement. On his latest visit, Trudeau visited an outlet of Jollibee, a chain that has become a byword for Filipino fast food, chatting and posing for selfies, charming the people of Manila again.

        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Fixing the corruption problem in China s ruling Communist Party is  world class hard  and the battle will never end, the country s top graft-buster told Singapore s prime minister in a rare meeting with a visiting foreign leader. Wang Qishan, who heads the party s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, has been at the forefront of President Xi Jinping s fight against deep-seated corruption, and speculation has swirled about whether he will retire or stay on at next month s key party Congress. Meeting Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the central leadership s Zhongnanhai compound in Beijing, Wang said the party s anti-corruption campaign and efforts to supervise itself had been highly effective.  Carrying out an operation on yourself to cure an illness is world class hard,  the commission cited Wang as saying, in a statement late on Wednesday. The party has long insisted it has no need for an independent anti-corruption mechanism, in a country where the party also controls the legal system. Wang said that the final aim in the graft fight was to find an effective route to self-supervision for a party that has been in power for a long time, and to always maintain the party s  progressiveness and cleanliness . The party s efforts have won the trust of the people and demonstrates the party s confidence in its system, he added. The anti-corruption effort is  always on the road , Wang said, using a frequently used party expression to refer to how the campaign will not end. Singapore s Straits Times said that the meeting with Wang had been requested by Lee, and that Wang told Lee he was surprised but happy the request had been made.  So I sought permission and I am here meeting you and your delegation today,  Wang told Lee, the newspaper reported.  Wang, who is 69 and sits on the party s elite ruling Standing Committee, should retire at next month s party Congress according to unwritten party rules on age limits, but he is close to Xi and could stay on in some capacity, sources with ties to the leadership have said.

        "title": "Mexican prosecutor says he was unjustly fired as graft dispute brews",
        "text": " (This version of the Oct. 25  story corrects story to change name to Emilio Lozoya in paragraph three) MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A prosecutor who led an investigation into a graft scandal involving the campaign of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Wednesday he was fired without justification, as the Senate prepares to vote on whether to reinstate him. Mexico s acting attorney general fired Santiago Nieto, the attorney general for election-related crimes, last week on grounds that he broke a code of conduct.  His summary dismissal came just days after an explosive interview with newspaper Reforma in which Nieto accused Emilio Lozoya, the former boss of state oil firm Pemex and a senior member of Pena Nieto s 2012 campaign team, of writing to him to ask that he be declared innocent of funneling Odebrecht cash into the president s campaign. Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht is at the heart of a Brazilian bribery and kickback probe, known as Lava Jato or Car Wash, that has reverberated across Latin America. Javier Coello Trejo, Lozoya s lawyer, said on Wednesday he had filed two criminal complaints against Nieto, alleging the former prosecutor had violated laws governing criminal proceedings, broadcaster Televisa reported.  Nieto s firing angered opposition politicians and has even threatened to delay discussions among lawmakers about next year s budget.  In Wednesday s television interview, Nieto denied breaking any rules, or revealing any sensitive information.  I didn t violate any code of ethics,  said Nieto, who was leading the probe targeting both Lozoya and the president s campaign. The Senate is due to vote in coming days on whether to reinstate Nieto, but it is still not clear when the vote will be and if it will be public.  In a sign of how tempers have frayed over the issue, opposition lawmakers have promised to delay voting on the 2018 budget until Nieto s case is resolved. The dispute is complicating efforts to shake off graft allegations that could hurt the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) ahead of next year s presidential election. Nieto could not be reached immediately for comment on Wednesday. Both the president and Lozoya, his close ally, have previously denied involvement in any wrongdoing related to the 2012 campaign. Mindful that corruption has become a key issue in the 2018 election, the PRI has overseen the arrest of various former state governors. Lozoya poses a more difficult challenge, given his proximity to the president. Opposition lawmakers have also criticized a decision by the Senate s governance body to hold the Nieto vote in private, vowing to appeal against the ruling. ",

Sheikh Ahmad al-Assir, who refused to recognize the hearing, was convicted for his part in clashes that erupted amid heightened sectarian tensions in 2013, exacerbated by the war in neighboring Syria. Assir rose to prominence supporting the mostly Sunni insurgents in Syria and condemning the backers of the Syrian government, including Lebanon s Shi ite Muslim Hezbollah group. Lebanese soldiers raided a mosque complex belonging to Assir in June 2013, after skirmishes between his supporters and opponents in the southern Mediterranean port city of Sidon. The army said at least 18 soldiers died in fighting with Assir's supporters, which raised fears at the time of sectarian violence spreading in Lebanon. (reut.rs/2xBmdx6) Assir went into hiding and was arrested two years later at Beirut airport, trying to get out with a false passport. He rejected his court-appointed lawyer during the trial, which has been delayed several times. Dozens of his supporters protested outside the court in Beirut and in Sidon on Thursday. The court also convicted more than 30 others, some in absentia, for their part in the violence, imposing sentences ranging from six months in prison to death.

The agreement, whose details are still being worked out, came as UNICEF reported that Rohingya refugee children fleeing into Bangladesh were arriving  close to death  from malnutrition. The WFP was previously distributing food rations to 110,000 people in northern Rakhine state - to both Buddhist and the minority Muslim Rohingya communities. Rohingya insurgent attacks on police stations triggered an army crackdown, that the United Nations has called  ethnic cleansing , and U.N. humanitarian agencies have not been able to access northern Rakhine to deliver aid since then. WFP deliveries have continued to 140,000 people in central Rakhine.  WFP has been given the green light to resume food assistance operations in northern part of Rakhine. We are working with the government to coordinate the details,  WFP spokeswoman Bettina Luescher told journalists in Geneva. She had no timeline or details on the proposed distribution of rations to northern Rakhine, and said it was still being discussed with the authorities in Myanmar.  We just have to see what the situation on the ground is. It s very hard to say these things if you can t get in,  Luescher said. Some 604,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh in the past two months, bringing the total to 817,000, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. Malnutrition rates in Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships in Rakhine, where the vast majority of the Rohingya refugees originate, were already above emergency threshold rates before the crisis, the U.N. Children s Fund (UNICEF) said.  Since August 25, we have had to stop treating 4,000 children with severe acute malnutrition in northern Rakhine because we have had no access,  UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado told the briefing. UNICEF has screened nearly 60,000 Rohingya refugee children arriving in Bangladesh, nearly 2,000 of whom have been identified as having severe acute malnutrition, with another 7,000 moderately acutely malnourished, she said. The agency screened 340 children among recent arrivals, a  rough and rapid exercise  that found 10 percent to be severely acutely malnourished, she said.   This is an extremely small number of children so these numbers are not representative,  Mercado said.  But what they do tell us is that some of the children are close to death by the time they make it across the border.  ",

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch s British newspaper group said on Friday one of its titles had hacked the computer of a former intelligence officer, an admission which critics said showed why his takeover of European broadcaster Sky should be blocked. In a hearing at London s High Court, Murdoch s News Group Newspapers admitted  vicarious liability  for the hacking of computers belonging to Ian Hurst, who worked for British military intelligence. The case comes a month after Britain s media minister said regulators should scrutinize Murdoch s planned $15 billion takeover of Sky over concerns about broadcasting standards and its impact on media plurality. Hurst s lawyer Jeremy Reed said in a court statement the Irish edition of the News of the World newspaper had hired a private investigator to intercept his client s emails in 2006.  Hurst had served in Northern Ireland and later wrote a book about his experiences, including details of Britain s top spy in the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Alfredo Scappaticci, known by the codename  Stakeknife .  Reed said it was likely he was targeted because an employee of the newspaper wanted to trace Scappaticci.  I confirm that News Group Newspapers ... accepts vicarious liability for the wrongful acts of computer interception,  said Anthony Hudson, the lawyer for the newspaper group, adding it had paid  substantial  damages to Hurst and his family.  News Group Newspapers accepts that such activity happened, accepts that it should never have happened, and has undertaken to the court that it will never happen again.  Opponents of Murdoch s takeover said the case was evidence the deal should not be allowed to go through and they would send a dossier to the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) which is examining the proposed deal.  It s vital that the CMA is able to take this new evidence of criminality and corporate failure into account as it assesses the Murdochs  bid to take over Sky,  said Tom Watson, deputy leader of Britain s opposition Labour Party.      Murdoch shut the News of the World in 2011 after its journalists were found to have been involved in widespread phone-hacking.    His original attempt to buy full control of Sky was ditched in the wake of the scandal. Since then the company has been split in two, separating the newspapers from entertainment assets to help to smooth the deal s passage. Last month Murdoch s son James said he was confident regulators would assess the deal on its merits and not be swayed by those with grievances against his father s newspapers, saying the company had dealt effectively with past problems.

        "title": "Ex-U.S. Rep. Weiner sentenced to 21 months in teen 'sexting' case",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner was sentenced to 21 months in prison on Monday for sending sexually explicit messages to a 15-year-old girl, setting off a scandal that played a role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Weiner, 53, started to cry as soon as the sentence was announced by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan. His wife Huma Abedin, an aide to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, was not in the courtroom and has filed for divorce. He pleaded guilty in May to transferring obscene material to a minor, and agreed he would not appeal any sentence of 27 months or less. \u201cI was a very sick man for a very long time, but I\u2019m also responsible for the damage I have done,\u201d Weiner read from a statement in court before he was sentenced. He said he was being treated, and asked Cote to spare him prison and sentence him to probation so he could continue treatment. Weiner\u2019s lawyer, Arlo Devlin-Brown, said that while Weiner exchanged sexually explicit messages with many women, all of the others were adults. Cote said she believed Weiner was suffering from an addiction, and was serious about being treated. However, she said it was important to deter others from committing similar crimes. \u201cThere is the opportunity to make a statement that could protect other minors,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are of course disappointed that Anthony was sentenced to prison, particularly so given that Judge Cote found that the treatment program Anthony had engaged in for the past year was showing great promise and should be continued,\u201d Weiner\u2019s lawyer, Devlin-Brown, said in a statement Monday afternoon. Weiner declined to speak to reporters as he left the courtroom. He was ordered to surrender by Nov. 6. The investigation into Weiner\u2019s exchanges with a North Carolina high school student roiled the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign in its final days, when authorities found emails on Weiner\u2019s laptop from his wife. Weiner, who wore his wedding band at the sentencing, and Abedin have a son, Jordan, who is 5 years old.  The discovery of the emails prompted James Comey, then director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to announce in late October that the agency was reopening its investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state. Clinton has said the announcement contributed to her upset loss to Republican Donald Trump, who had accused her of endangering national security by using the private server. President Trump fired Comey in May amid the FBI\u2019s probe into whether his campaign colluded with Russia to defeat Clinton, a claim the president has denied. Weiner represented parts of New York City in the U.S. House of Representatives for 12 years before resigning in 2011, after it emerged that he had exchanged sexually explicit messages with adult women. In 2013, Weiner ran for New York City mayor, but was defeated in the Democratic primary after more lewd messages became public. (This version of the story corrects paragraph 16 to say that Weiner did not drop out of the 2013 mayoral election, but instead was defeated). ",

Lawmakers, who had cast aside a conservative push to allow religious objectors to refuse service to same-sex couples, waved rainbow flags and embraced on the floor of the chamber, after the overwhelming vote in favour of the bill. Fewer than five of 150 MPs voted against it.  What a day. What a day for love, for equality, for respect,  said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.  It is time for more marriages.  The law, which will also recognise same-sex marriages solemnised in foreign countries, takes effect from Saturday. Because a month s notice is required for the state to recognise a marriage, the first legal same-sex unions will be in January. Five-time Olympic gold-medal winner, the swimmer Ian Thorpe, who came out in 2014, said the law reflected contemporary Australia and would support people identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual queer or intersex (LGBTQI).   It will give each of us the sense of what modern Australia is, and is, in fact, the way that most of us see this country as being, and will allow LGBTQI people in our nation to know that fairness is one of our values,  he told reporters in Canberra. Australians had overwhelmingly endorsed legalising same-sex marriage in a postal survey.  What a moment for the country,  said Christine Forster, a Sydney councillor and the sister of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, standing among throngs of rainbow-clad campaigners for a  Yes  vote, outside parliament with her female partner. She said she planned to go to her brother s house to celebrate. Abbott, who is still a member of parliament, was one of the most prominent  no  campaigners. He left the chamber before the vote. The bill cleared the upper house last month. During the debate in the lower house on Monday, a politician proposed to his same-sex partner. Both Turnbull s Liberal-National coalition government and the main opposition Labor Party had said they wanted to pass it by Dec. 7. But despite the support of the main parties, religious organisations and conservative lawmakers had voiced strong opposition and proposed dozens of amendments. During the debate, they pressed for broad protections for religious objectors, among them florists and bankers, to refuse service to same-sex couples. But their efforts were rejected.  These amendments, rather, are a shield for people and organisations that hold to a traditional view of marriage. They are not a sword to be wielded in the service of bigotry,  government MP Andrew Hastie said in parliament. Amendments to permit lay celebrants to decline to solemnise same-sex marriages and businesses opposed to the unions to refuse service at wedding receptions were all defeated, one after the other, during three days of debate.  Love has won, and it s time to pop the bubbly,  Greens MP and same-sex marriage supporter Adam Bandt said.  ",

        "title": "Obama pick to lead U.S. military in Africa favors powers to strike Islamic State",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to lead the U.S. military in Africa on Tuesday backed the idea of gaining greater power to strike Islamic State, including in Libya, which he described as the group\u2019s Plan B as it loses territory in Iraq and Syria. Marine Lieutenant General Thomas Waldhauser told his Senate confirmation hearing that the U.S. military was making preparations for possible military strikes in Libya against the militants. But Waldhauser noted limitations on the current commander\u2019s ability to order strikes against the group in Libya, which require adhering to White House guidance. That differs from the rules of engagement in Iraq or Syria. Asked by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham whether it would be wise for Obama to give the commander of the Africa Command the authority to go after Islamic State targets in Africa \u201con your own,\u201d Waldhauser said: \u201cIt would be wise.\u201d \u201cIt would certainly contribute to what we\u2019re trying to do inside Libya,\u201d he responded. Islamic State established a presence in several parts of the country from 2014, and has been active between Benghazi and the militant group\u2019s coastal stronghold of Sirte, about 380 km (240 miles) to the west. In recent weeks, however, the ultra-hardline group has retreated into the center of Sirte after forces aligned with Libya\u2019s U.N.-backed unity government advanced from the western city of Misrata. One reason Islamic State established itself in Sirte, Waldhauser told the Senate Armed Services Committee, was \u201cto be kind of a backup if Iraq and Syria fail,\u201d he said.  Waldhauser estimated that Islamic State faced between 3,000 and 4,000 opponents fighting the group around Sirte, drawn from the Mirsratan militia forces and the Petroleum Facilities Guard Central Branch.  But he cautioned that alliances can shift among the Libyan militia, driven by everything from tribal ties and religious beliefs to material gain. \u201cThe unpredictable nature of paramilitary group patronage will most likely remain a significant obstacle to the GNA\u2019s efforts to establish sovereignty,\u201d he said in written testimony. For months, the United States has had a small number of U.S. forces rotating in and out of Libya, establishing contact with fighters inside the country.  Waldhauser said they were acting in an advisory role to support the unity government, and said no more U.S. troops were needed in the country at this time. ",

        "text": "LAGOS (Reuters) - A Nigerian militant group whose attacks on energy facilities in the Niger Delta last year helped push Africa s biggest economy into recession said on Friday it had ended its ceasefire. The Niger Delta Avengers announced a halt to hostilities in August 2016, although they carried out attacks in October and November last year.  \"Niger Delta Avenger's ceasefire on Operation Red Economy is officially over,\" the group said on its website ( www.nigerdeltaavengers.org/ ).    Our next line of operation will not be like the 2016 campaign which we operated successfully without any casualties; this outing will be brutish, brutal and bloody,  it said in a section of its statement addressed to oil companies.  The move threatens Nigeria s fragile economic growth and poses a further security challenge for President Muhammadu Buhari, in addition to the jihadist Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast and rising secessionist sentiments in the southeast. The government has been in talks for more than a year to address grievances over poverty and oil pollution but local groups have complained that no progress has been made, despite Buhari receiving a list of demands at a meeting last November.  Buhari s office did not immediately comment.  The 2016 attacks cut oil production from a peak of 2.2 million barrels per day (mbpd) to near 1 mbpd, the lowest level in Africa s top oil producer for at least 30 years.  The attacks, combined with low oil prices, caused the OPEC member s first recession in 25 years. Crude sales make up two-thirds of government revenue and most of its foreign exchange. Nigeria came out of recession in the second quarter of this year, mostly due to the rise in oil production after attacks stopped and as prices strengthened. The Niger Delta Avengers, who say they want a greater share of Nigeria s energy wealth to go to the impoverished swampland region, said they decided to end the ceasefire because they had  lost faith  in local leaders.  We can assure you that every oil installation in our region will feel the warmth of the wrath of the Niger Delta Avengers,  it said. There have been no substantial attacks in the region since January.   Eric Omare, president of the Ijaw Youth Council, which represents the largest ethnic group in the Niger Delta, said the government had paid only  lip service  to communities  concerns.   The truth is that the federal government has not demonstrated any seriousness towards addressing the issues that led to the Niger Delta agitation,  Omare said, while adding that his group sought a  peaceful dialogue.  Nigeria s economy grew 0.55 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, largely on higher oil receipts. The World Bank cut its 2017 growth forecast in October to 1 percent from 1.2 percent as the oil production increase was lower than expected and non-oil sector growth was subdued. ",

        "title": "Clinton disparages Trump's economic plan, vows to help workers",
        "text": "WARREN, Mich. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday said rival Donald Trump had no real plans to help middle-class families, arguing that his agenda of tax cuts and tough trade talk would throw the economy into recession. \u201cHe\u2019s\u00a0offered no credible plans to address what working families are up against today,\u201d Clinton said in Warren, Michigan, shortly after touring Futuramic, a hangar-like, high-tech factory that makes parts for the aerospace industry. Clinton said Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, would scrap regulations meant to hold corporations accountable, cut taxes on \u201cmillionaires and Wall Street money managers,\u201d and eliminate the estate tax, an inheritance tax that generally hits the wealthy. Clinton offered no new proposals of her own but sought to cast doubt on the image Trump promotes of himself as the voice for working people. The New York businessman is counting on his appeal to blue-collar voters with concerns about global trade to boost his chances in key states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. Clinton on Thursday ran through many of the policies she has outlined over the last year to contrast herself with Trump, who has given far fewer details about his plans, as the presidential campaign heads toward the Nov. 8 election. Speaking to Fox News later on Thursday, Trump said he would cut business taxes to bring jobs back to the United States, while Clinton would have to double taxes to meet the increased spending on social programs in her plan. Trump delivered an economic speech in Detroit on Monday. He publicly named his economic advisers last week, which Clinton mocked as \u201csix guys named Steve.\u201d On Thursday, he released a list of nine additions to the council, eight of whom were women. New members included roofing billionaire Diane Hendricks, investor Carla Sands and hedge funder Anthony Scaramucci. Workers\u2019 anxiety over trade deals has become a central theme in the 2016 election, and Clinton rejected the portrait Trump has painted that she only pretends not to favor the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal she praised when she was secretary of state from 2009-2013 but has more recently opposed. Clinton also says she would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed by former President Bill Clinton, her husband. Trump routinely disparages the agreement as bad for American jobs.  \u201cIt\u2019s true that too often past trade deals have been sold to the American people with rosy scenarios that didn\u2019t pan out,\u201d Clinton told the crowd of factory workers. \u201cThe answer is not to rant and rave, or cut ourselves off from the world. \u201cThe answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us,\u201d she said. \u201cSo my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201d ",

        "title": "Trump sides with Democrats on debt limit in rare bipartisan deal",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - President Donald Trump forged a surprising deal with Democrats in Congress on Wednesday to extend the U.S. debt limit and provide government funding until Dec. 15, embracing his political adversaries and blindsiding fellow Republicans in a rare bipartisan accord. Trump, living up to his reputation for unpredictability, met at the White House with congressional leaders from both parties and overruled Republicans and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who wanted a longer-term debt-limit extension rather than the three-month Democratic proposal the president embraced. \u201cWe could have done a one-year deal today,\u201d Mnuchin told reporters aboard Air Force One later in the day en route back to Washington from an event in North Dakota where Trump spoke about taxes. Mnuchin said Trump chose a short-term deal to keep his options open on possibly raising military funding later this year, suggesting a longer-term government funding deal might have blocked that. Trump is very focused on military spending, \u201cparticularly with what\u2019s going on in North Korea and other parts of the world today,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cThe president wasn\u2019t willing to give up his need for additional military spending.\u201d If passed by the Republican-led Congress, the three-month agreement would avert an unprecedented default on U.S. government debt, keep the government funded at the outset of the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and provide aid to victims of Hurricane Harvey. \u201cIt was a really good moment of some bipartisanship and getting things done,\u201d top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said. Less than an hour before the meeting, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan had called the Democratic proposal that Trump later embraced a \u201cridiculous and disgraceful\u201d idea that would \u201cplay politics with the debt ceiling.\u201d Even with the three-month extension of the debt limit, a Senate Republican aide told reporters that nothing in the tentative deal would stop the Treasury Department from using its powers to extend the deadline, depending on revenue flow. In the past, the debt limit deadline has been extended for several months under those powers. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, overridden by Trump during the meeting, said he would bring the deal to the Senate floor for a vote. \u201cThe president can speak for himself, but his feeling was that we needed to come together, to not create a picture of divisiveness at a time of genuine national crisis,\u201d McConnell told reporters. The agreement was an uncommon instance of bipartisan compromise since Trump took office in January. Washington has suffered through bitter partisanship that has at times left the U.S. capital dysfunctional under Trump and his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump had tangled repeatedly with Schumer and top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi. \u201cWe had a very good meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer,\u201d Trump, a wealthy businessman who as a candidate touted his deal-making skills, told reporters aboard Air Force One, without mentioning McConnell or Ryan, with whom he has had fraught relations. \u201cWe agreed to a three-month extension on debt ceiling, which they consider to be sacred, very important. Always we\u2019ll agree on debt ceiling, automatically because of the importance of it,\u201d Trump said. Conservative groups were aghast, accusing Trump of caving in to the Democrats rather than insisting on spending cuts to accompany the debt ceiling increase, and some hard-line Republicans expressed opposition to it. Republican leaders and Mnuchin pushed in the meeting for an 18-month debt limit hike, then floated six months, but Pelosi and Schumer held firm to their three-month proposal and Trump sided with them, according to people familiar with the meeting. The party in power, in this case Republicans, often argues for the longest debt limit increase as possible for two reasons. First, it protects members of Congress from casting multiple votes on the politically unpopular legislation over a short period of time, especially in the run-up to the 2018 congressional elections. Second, it helps stabilize markets.  For minority Democrats, whose votes are needed to pass debt ceiling increases, they could potentially use the debt limit vote later in the year as leverage to win concessions on a tax overhaul package that Trump badly wants to advance. Even though Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, Trump has yet to win passage of any major legislation, with Democrats typically united against him. The House on Wednesday approved roughly $8 billion in initial emergency aid for relief and rebuilding after Hurricane Harvey, which tore into Texas on Aug. 25, with the measure now going to the Senate.    \u201cOur No. 1 priority was getting funding for Harvey,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cTo get the funding for Harvey, we needed to extend the debt limit.\u201d U.S. shares rose and the dollar gained against the safe-haven Japanese yen as word of the deal helped mitigate investor concerns about North Korea and a major hurricane barreling toward Florida. The news also lifted the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR after it had fallen to a near 10-month low at 2.054 percent. The Treasury Department has said the ceiling must be raised in the next few weeks. If not, the government would be unable to borrow more money or pay its bills, including its debt payments. That could hurt the U.S. credit rating, cause financial turmoil, harm the economy and possibly trigger a recession. Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, was aboard Air Force One when he heard about the short-term deal. He told reporters on the plane: \u201cI will tell you that I gasped when I heard it.\u201d He said the deal would be a \u201ctough sell\u201d for House Republicans but that some would \u201cwarm up to the idea\u201d when they learned more about it.

        "title": "Peru's Congress passes law to target Odebrecht's partners",
        "text": "LIMA (Reuters) - Peru s opposition-ruled Congress voted 55-21 late on Thursday to pass legislation that expands a raft of new financial restrictions to the local partners of scandal-plagued Brazilian builder Odebrecht. If signed by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, the law would deliver a fresh blow to Peru s biggest construction group, Grana y Montero, just as the company s shares have been climbing back from a sharp drop after partner Odebrecht admitted to a decade-long bribery scheme last year. Supporters of the bill said Odebrecht s partners might have had a hand in the graft and must be included in anti-corruption rules passed early this year that restrict the transfer of company assets abroad until civil reparations have been paid. The legislation would also seize companies   ill-gotten gains  made from government contracts. Grana declined to comment on the legislation. The company has repeatedly denied knowing about or being involved in Odebrecht s bribes and said last week that a 6-month internal probe it commissioned turned up no evidence of wrongdoing. Lawmakers in Kuczynski s party voted against the bill and his government will likely send it back to Congress saying it violates the presumption of innocence, a former deputy justice minister in Kuczynski s government, Edgar Carpio, told Reuters. The justice ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The bill taps growing impatience in Peru with criminal investigations related to Odebrecht that have yet to yield any convictions or broaden to target additional companies.  It s been a year and nothing,  opposition lawmaker Victor Andres Belaunde said.  We re disappointed with the lack of courage of many who don t want to confront corruption.  Right-wing opposition party Popular Force, which dominates Congress, has slammed Kuczynski s government and the attorney general s office as soft on graft. Opposition lawmakers have demanded Kuczynski face questioning in Congress about what he knew about Odebrecht s bribes when he was part of the cabinet of former president Alejandro Toledo, whom prosecutors allege took $20 million from the company in exchange for lucrative highway contracts. Grana partnered with Odebrecht on two of the highway contracts and a $5 billion natural gas pipeline project that was canceled this year as the bribery scandal unfolded. Kuczynski has denied wrongdoing and has answered lawmakers  questions about his knowledge of Odebrecht in writing, but he has said he would not do so in a congressional commission because it would be a  circus.

        "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has frozen requests to commercially release a locally developed genetically modified mustard, an environment ministry document released on Tuesday showed, amid stiff opposition to lab-altered food from domestic activists and politicians. The mustard variety would have been the first transgenic food crop to be allowed for commercial cultivation. But the environment ministry's Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) has deferred approval despite a panel the ministry supervises giving the genetically modified (GM) mustard technical clearance last year. (bit.ly/2cnUOkZ) \"Subsequent to receipt of various representations from different stakeholders, matters related to environmental release of transgenic mustard are kept pending for further review,\" the GEAC said in minutes of a meeting released on the environment ministry's website marked \"confidential and restricted circulation\". (bit.ly/2yJrRLU) Cotton is the only GM crop currently allowed to be sold in the world s second most populous country where arable land is shrinking. U.S. company Monsanto Co dominates the cotton seed market in India, and often faces resistance from local companies over its position. The environment ministry told parliament on July 31 that GM mustard had been recommended by GEAC to it for \"consideration for environmental release and cultivation\". (bit.ly/2gCNc54) An environment ministry spokesman directed Reuters to GEAC head Amita Prasad, whose office said she was not available. Another GEAC official named on the ministry s website, Madhumita Biswas, did not respond to requests for comment. The decision on the mustard represents a setback for Deepak Pental and his colleagues at the Delhi University, who worked on developing and testing the variety for years. Pental, who earlier acknowledged that getting a go-ahead for GM food would be difficult, declined to comment on Tuesday. GM food has been opposed by activists and politicians in India due to fears that it could compromise food safety and biodiversity. Some experts have also questioned claims that GM crops are more productive than normal varieties. Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh - Hindi for \"national volunteer organization\" and the ideological parent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party - also opposes GM food and instead wants to promote local varieties. (reut.rs/2y1iytL) Even the previous government, led by the current opposition Congress party, in 2010 placed a moratorium on GM eggplant, also after an experts panel had given its clearance - effectively bringing the regulatory system to a deadlock before Modi revived it.

        "title": "Trump's new travel ban raises bar for legal challenges",
        "text": "NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The new, more narrowly tailored temporary travel ban President Donald Trump signed on Monday will be more difficult to challenge successfully in court, legal experts said. They said that since his order no longer covers legal residents or existing visa holders, and makes waivers possible for some business, diplomatic and other travelers, challengers are likely to have a harder time finding people in the United States who can legally claim they have been harmed, and thus have so-called \u201cstanding\u201d to sue.  Trump\u2019s first executive order signed on Jan. 27 banned travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - for 90 days and halted refugee admission for four months, barring Syrian refugees indefinitely. Its hasty implementation caused chaos and protests at airports. The order was hit with more than two dozen lawsuits, many that claimed it discriminated against Muslims. The new ban, which goes into effect on March 16, removes Iraq and adds categories of people who would be exempt from the order. The Trump administration said the executive order is necessary for national security reasons. It also lists groups of people that could be eligible for waivers, including travelers who have previously been admitted to the United States for work or school, those seeking to visit or live with a close relative and who would face hardship if denied entry; infants, young children and adoptees or people in need of medical care, employees of the U.S. government and international organizations among others.      All the exceptions make the new order \u201ca lot harder to attack,\u201d said Andrew Greenfield, an immigration attorney with Fragomen law firm in Washington D.C.  Trump had promised to make the new directive harder to fight in court and many of the changes were expected. \u201cThey dotted their \u2018i\u2019s\u2019 and crossed their \u2018t\u2019s\u2019 in trying to anticipate what litigation might result,\u201d said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell Law School professor who specializes in immigration. He said opponents might still be able to find plaintiffs - a U.S. citizen could potentially sue if the government denies a waiver to their foreign spouse for an arbitrary reason, for example. In a legal challenge to the original order, the state of Washington was successful in preventing it from being carried out. A federal judge in Seattle and then an appeals court in San Francisco ruled that Washington could claim standing, in part because the order adversely affected legal permanent residents, known as green card holders, in the state. More than 100 businesses, including many of the best-known tech companies, filed briefs in court that argued their employees were harmed. Bob Ferguson, the Attorney General for Washington State said on Monday that he will likely decide on the next litigation steps this week after consulting with state universities and businesses about potential harms. \u201cWe need to do our homework and be thoughtful about this,\u201d Ferguson said. The U.S. Department of Justice, in a filing in Seattle federal court on Monday, said the new order applies \u201conly to those who are overseas and without a visa.\u201d  Foreign nationals outside the country who do not have a U.S. visa do not have the same protections under the U.S. Constitution as people already here, legal experts said.  Rosemary Jenks, the director of Government Relations at NumbersUSA, a conservative group that favors less immigration overall, said that the new order would leave the state of Washington having to argue on behalf of unidentified foreign nationals who have not been screened, vetted or processed yet by U.S. authorities. \u201cThat would be a pretty big stretch,\u201d Jenks said. And unlike the old order, the new one lays out with more detail why the specific countries were selected, she said.   Attorneys challenging the ban, including the American Civil Liberties Union said there were still questions about whether or not the ban is justified by national security reasons and the revisions do not address concerns that the order discriminates based on religion.  Adam Lauridsen, a Keker & Van Nest attorney in San Francisco representing students challenging Trump\u2019s first order, noted the revised directive still targets Muslim-majority countries.  Stephen\u00a0Legomsky, chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the previous Obama administration,     pointed to statements by Trump about wanting a Muslim ban. \u201cThat evidence is baked in, you can\u2019t change the past,\u201d said Legomsky. He said, however, that does not mean the inevitable legal challenges will ultimately be successful in the likelihood that they reach the U.S. Supreme Court. \u201cIt\u2019s not a slam dunk.\u201d ",

        "title": "At least 1,300 Dutch girls per year trafficked, exploited",
        "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - At least 1,320 underage Dutch girls between the ages of 12 and 17 fall victim to sexual exploitation in the Netherlands each year, a report on human trafficking published on Wednesday showed. That group makes up nearly half of female trafficking victims in the Dutch sex industry, Corinne Dettmeijer, National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings and Sexual Violence against Children, said in the study. Dettmeijer said the report contained the first reliable statistics on human trafficking in the Netherlands and the first of their kind in Europe, but was concerned by a decline in cases indicating that fewer were being reported. The 108-page report compiled both domestic and United Nations figures from 2012-2016. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which cooperated on the report, is encouraging other countries to  produce similar data, to help create a clearer international picture of the scale of the crimes. The total number of human trafficking victims in the Netherlands is roughly five times higher than reported figures indicated, at about 6,250 cases per year, it said,  meaning that many victims stay out of sight of authorities and support agencies.  Roughly half of about 3,000 cases of sexual exploitation, predominantly woman, involved underage girls.   The number is high, but what makes these statistics unique is that they show us what specific groups are falling prey to human trafficking,  National Rapporteur Corinne Dettmeijer said in an interview.  It has exposed our blind spots.   In a report published in 2015, the European Commission said there had been over 30,000 victims of human trafficking between 2010-2012 across all EU member States, of which around 1,000 were child victims were trafficked for sexual exploitation.  Dettmeijer said it was known that a relatively high number of women from Central and Eastern Europe were being forced into the sex industry, but the number of underage Dutch girls was surprising. The figures were also remarkable because the number of reported cases of trafficking has fallen sharply over the past five years, from nearly 1,300 in 2012 to below a thousand last year.  I am very concerned about the falling number of reported cases,  Dettmeijer said.  This means that an increasingly larger portion of trafficking of humans is going unreported.  ",

        "title": "Iceland leans toward leftist government in snap election",
        "text": "REYKJAVIK (Reuters) - Icelanders, angry over a string of political scandals, ousted their center-right government in an election that could pave the way for a charismatic young opposition leader to form a left-leaning coalition, final vote counts showed on Sunday. With the defeat of incumbent Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson s coalition government, his main opponent, the Left-Green Movement s Katrin Jakobsdottir, is likely to get a chance to form a narrow majority in parliament. Still, the composition of any coalition government remained uncertain, as the president had not yet mandated a party to form one. The Nordic island of 340,000 people, one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 financial crisis, has staged a remarkable economic rebound spurred by a tourism boom. Benediktsson called the snap election in September, after less than a year in government, as a scandal involving his father prompted the Bright Future party to drop out of his ruling coalition, citing a breach of trust. The previous government was defeated last year following revelations in the Panama Papers about then-Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson s use of offshore tax havens. In addition to the political scandals, a growing sense of inequality and unease about immigration in one of the world s most ethnically homogeneous nations have rattled a democracy known for its political and social stability. After the final vote count, Jakobsdottir, 41, of the Left-Greens stood to gain a narrow majority in parliament with three other opposition parties. The result showed a Left-Green-led coalition was possible if they joined forces with the Social Democrats, the Progressive Party and the Pirate Party. Together, they would hold 32 of parliament s 63 seats.   The opposition has a majority, so that s a message. But we ve also talked about that maybe things should be done differently and create a broader government,  Jakobsdottir said in a TV debate on Sunday. The Left-Greens want to reduce inequality and fund an increase in public health care, education and infrastructure spending by raising taxes for the wealthy and introducing a property tax.  The parliament will be split among eight parties. There are two new parties, and one of the parties in the current tri-party government failed to get enough votes to remain in parliament. The Independence Party, the main partner in the current government coalition, lost 4 percentage points from last year s election to take 25 percent of the vote. It remains the biggest party, but the election was the worst since 2009 for a party that has dominated Iceland s politics for decades, getting support of as much as 40 percent of voters. Asked during the TV debate if the Independence Party would get the chance to form a new government, Benediktsson said:  I think so. We are the biggest party, and I think it s normal that we should be a part of a future government.  We are attacked as a party that bears responsibility for certain things,  he said.  We are in a new environment, and considering that I am happy with the result.  His party wants to reduce the national debt and cut taxes on individuals and businesses.  The Left-Greens came in second with 17 percent, up 1 percentage point from last year s election, and its probable ally the Social Democrats in third with 12 percent, almost doubling its share.  I think that the opposition with one extra party can create a really strong government,  said Social Democrat leader Logi Einarsson, hinting at the possibility of a five-party government. The new Centre Party, which was formed in September by former Prime Minister Gunnlaugsson, won 11 percent of the votes. The Pirate Party, which last year rode a wave of anger against the establishment to become the third biggest party in parliament, stood to get 9 percent of votes in Saturday s election down from 14 percent last year.

        "title": "Defiant Kurds shrug off risk of trade war after independence vote",
        "text": "ZAKHO, Iraq (Reuters) - More than three weeks after Iraq s Kurds voted for independence, it s business as usual at the bustling Ibrahim Khalil border crossing with Turkey. Ankara has threatened to impose economic sanctions on Iraq s autonomous Kurdistan region to deter moves towards independence, but hundreds of trucks still cross the border each day   some with supplies for Kurdish areas, others en route to Baghdad.  Closure of the border would sever a lifeline for the region in northern Iraq and step up efforts by Turkey, Iran and the Iraqi government to isolate it.   But the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) is gambling that its three main trade partners will be reluctant to impose a blockade that would put billions of dollars in trade at risk and could hurt all sides involved.      We send about 100 packed trucks a day to Baghdad,  said Hani Anas, a trader standing by rows of steel rods stacked near the border.  Iraq will suffer as well.  It is a risky gamble for a region that is heavily dependent on food imports and oil exports, via a pipeline that passes through Turkey. The undermining of its economy could deal a heavy blow to its chances of survival as an independent state if it pushes ahead with breakaway moves. The outcome of the standoff could also have repercussions far beyond the immediate region as Iraqi Kurdistan produces about 650,000 barrels of crude oil per day   15 percent of Iraqi output and around 0.7 percent of global oil production.  The KRG has not taken any formal steps to break away from Iraq since the Kurds overwhelmingly backed independence in a referendum on Sept. 25, but has scheduled regional presidential and parliamentary elections for Nov. 1.  If Baghdad tries to hurt us it will hurt itself,  said Soran Aziz, vice president of the chamber of commerce and industry in the Kurdish administrative capital Erbil.  If borders are closed with neighboring countries it will have a limited impact on us,  he added.  If an economic blockade impacts us by 1 percent, it will impact them by 10 percent.  Baghdad opposes Kurdish independence because it wants to hold Iraq together. Iran and Turkey fear secession would encourage their own Kurdish populations to press for a homeland, and Washington worries that the tensions will damage unity in the fight against Islamic State. Iraqi Kurdistan is certainly vulnerable over its economy. Apart from oil, it is largely dependent on agriculture, tourism, and cement and steel exports to Baghdad and other Iraqi cities. But some Iraqi officials acknowledge that blocking the main trade route between Iraqi Kurdistan and other parts of Iraq would hit not just the Kurds  economy. Turkish exports to Iraq this year had by the end of August reached $6.4 billion.     This key trade route is a lifeline for all of us and we will make sure to keep it operational, no matter what levels of disagreements,  said Waleed Mohammed, an advisor to the Iraqi trade ministry.     Near the border with Turkey, traders seem confident as they work their cell phones, dealing with orders. Around them, laborers load crates of powdered milk and potatoes on to trucks that haul average loads of 27 tonnes to Baghdad and elsewhere.  There is no way anyone can close down the border. One truck arrives and then heads to Baghdad, another one goes the other way,  said Samer Rushdi, a trader who says he is so busy he cannot take time off. Even so, pressure on the Kurds has mounted since the referendum, especially from Baghdad, which has imposed an air ban on Iraqi Kurdistan, slapped sanctions on Kurdish banks and halted foreign currency transfers to the region.  Iraqi government forces have also captured the city of Kirkuk, wresting control of an area that is rich in oil and a vital source of revenue. Government forces have also taken control of Kurdish-held areas of Nineveh province, which includes the city of Mosul, and the Mosul hydro-electric dam is among the positions recaptured, according to a government statement. Iran has shut its border crossings with Iraqi Kurdistan and Turkey has said it could do the same, warning the Kurds they will go hungry if the border is closed and that their revenues will dry up if it closes the oil tap. Iran has vast economic and military influence in Iraq, but also has reason to tread cautiously.  Iraqi officials say Tehran has gained a big edge in the Iraqi market by flooding the country with cheap goods such as air conditioners and cars, and cannot afford prolonged disruptions. Iran exports goods worth about $20 million dollars to Iraq each day. One third of the exports   goods worth about $200 million a month   go to the KRG, Hamid Hosseini, head of the Iran-Iraq Chamber of Commerce, was quoted as saying by Iranian media.  About 2,000 trucks usually bring goods from Iran to Iraq each day   with 500 to 600 of them delivering items to the KRG. But since the referendum, Iran has prevented at least 600 trucks, carrying about 13,000 tonnes of fuel, from crossing the border into Iraqi Kurdistan. At the Haj Omran border post, a poster of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, stares down at rows trucks lined up to cross the border.  Iran can t afford to shut the border,  Kurdish truck driver Jalal Rasoul said.  Besides, it s our right to create an independent state.  ",

        "title": "Republicans unveil tax cut bill, but the hard work awaits",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Republicans unveiled long-delayed legislation on Thursday to deliver deep tax cuts that President Donald Trump has promised, setting off a frantic race in Congress to give him his first major legislative victory. The 429-page bill, representing what would be the largest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the 1980s, called for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, cutting tax rates on individuals and families and ending certain tax breaks for companies and individuals. Congressional passage of this legislation that would affect nearly every U.S. company and family was far from certain, and some business groups quickly came out against it. Contentious provisions will test Republicans, who control the White House and both chambers of Congress but have been unable to deliver any major legislative achievements for Trump since the businessman-turned-politician became president in January. A number of provisions would hit taxpayers in Democratic-leaning states hardest, like rolling back deductions for state and local taxes and cutting in half the popular mortgage interest deduction.  The legislation, called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, produces new advantages for rich Americans through lowered corporate taxes, phasing out the estate tax and dumping the alternative minimum tax.  \u201cThis is a very important and special moment for our country, for all Americans. Are we going to let the defenders of the status quo win and see our country continue down this downward spiral?\u201d Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan asked, despite data showing about eight straight years of economic growth. Meeting with Ryan and other key House Republicans, Trump told the lawmakers he was counting on them to maintain the momentum for tax cuts, and repeated his request that Congress send him the legislation to sign into law by the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23. That is an ambitious timetable for such a long, multi-faceted piece of legislation that will face a ferocious lobbying battle among business sectors affected by the bill and fierce opposition from many Democrats. Trump called the bill an \u201cimportant step\u201d toward tax relief for Americans, adding in a statement, \u201cWe are just getting started, and there is much work left to do.\u201d The bill presented by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee would consolidate the current number of tax brackets to four from seven: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. An earlier Republican tax outline had called for cutting the top rate for the highest earners to 35 percent. The National Association of Home Builders blasted the legislation, saying it would damage home prices and punish homeowners in urban areas.  \u201cWe\u2019re concerned if enacted, this bill will throw us back into another housing recession,\u201d Jerry Howard, the group\u2019s president, said in an interview. The group said the provision in the bill capping the interest deduction for future home purchases at $500,000 - half the current amount - was unacceptable. Howard said 7 million homes are currently above $500,000 and in high-cost regions like Washington, D.C., New York City, California and Hawaii, the impact would be felt the most.  The bill would repeal the existing deduction for state and local income and sales taxes, and would cap the deduction for state and local property taxes at $10,000. Those provisions would most affect Americans in higher-tax states such as California, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Illinois. The National Federation of Independent Business, the influential small business lobby, also came out against the bill, while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobby backed it. Ryan said the typical family of four would save $1,182 annually on taxes under the bill.  With Democrats solidly opposed to legislation they see as a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would expand the federal deficit, Republicans can ill afford to lose many in their own ranks as they aim to pass the bill in the coming weeks. \u201cUltimately, what the American people really get from this tax plan is a huge bill for the debt incurred to pay for tax breaks that line the pockets of Donald Trump personally along with his billionaire buddies. Like a Trump University degree, it is phony,\u201d said Democratic congressman Lloyd Doggett. The bill\u2019s architects avoided one showdown by deciding not to make changes to the popular tax-deferred 401(k) retirement savings program. The bill would roughly double the standard deduction for individuals and families. But it would repeal a personal exemption of $4,050 that taxpayers can currently claim for themselves, their spouse and any dependents. The legislation would also phase out tax-exempt financing for sports stadiums and subject large private universities to 1.4-percent excise tax on investment income. It would also repeal a long standing prohibition on religious institutions being involved in political activities. The bill would create a new family tax credit and double exemptions for estate taxes on inherited assets, while also allowing small businesses to write off loan interest. The bill would cap the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non-corporate enterprises at 25 percent, down from the present maximum rate on \u201cpass-through\u201d income of 39.6 percent. It would set standards for distinguishing between individual wage income and actual pass-through business income to prevent tax-avoidance abuse of the new, lower tax level. It would create a new 10-percent tax on U.S. companies\u2019 high-profit foreign subsidiaries, calculated on a global basis, in a move to prevent companies from moving profits overseas. Foreign businesses operating in the United States would face a tax of up to 20 percent on payments they make overseas from their American operations. U.S. equities have rallied in 2017 to a series of record highs, partly on expectations of deep corporate tax cuts. Shares of U.S. homebuilders fell after the bill was released, with luxury homebuilders including Toll Brothers taking the biggest hit. As investors parsed its provisions, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up modestly and the S&P 500 was down slightly. Investors cautioned the tax plan was preliminary and it was too soon to gauge the effect on specific industries. [nL2N1N81IG] The Ways and Means Committee will begin formal consideration of the bill next week before the full House can vote on it. It also must pass the Senate, where Republicans hold a slimmer 52-48 majority and earlier this year failed to garner enough votes to approve a major healthcare overhaul sought by Trump. ",

        "title": "Clinton names Obama veterans to White House transition team",
        "text": "WEST HARRISON, N.Y. (Reuters) - Looking to lay the groundwork for her presidency if she wins the White House in November, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton named several veterans of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration for her transition team on Tuesday. Ken Salazar, a former interior secretary and U.S. Senator from Colorado, will lead a team of four co-chairs including one-time national security adviser Tom Donilon and Neera Tanden, a former Obama aide who now leads the progressive Center for American Progress think-tank, the Clinton campaign said. The other co-chairs are former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm and Maggie Williams, director of Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics, the campaign said in a statement. The announcement came as Clinton has gained momentum in the opinion polls against Republican rival Donald Trump, whose campaign has struggled after he made a string of controversial remarks since formally winning his party\u2019s nomination last month. Clinton leads Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election by more than 5 percentage points in a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll released on Friday. The current RealClearPolitics average of polls shows her 6.7 points ahead. Clinton has been a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady and her transition team includes old names from her long tenure in Washington, some of whom have also served Obama. Tanden, who played a key role in shaping Obama\u2019s health care overhaul, is a longtime friend and adviser to Clinton who worked on her Senate campaign. Williams was the 1992 transition director for Clinton when she became first lady, and then her chief of staff in the White House when Bill Clinton was president. Two policy advisers on the campaign, Ed Meier and Ann O\u2019Leary, will also move full time to the transition team.  Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, will be the chief economist, the campaign said in a statement. Boushey has advised the campaign on economic policy. Transition teams oversee personnel appointments and help develop an administrative framework during the period between the November election and the inauguration in January, to make it easier for a new president to begin implementing policy agendas. Trump, a New York businessman who has never held elected office, picked New Jersey Governor Chris Christie to head his own transition team in May. More establishment Republicans, alarmed by Trump\u2019s inability or unwillingness to rein in his provocative remarks, have distanced themselves from the candidate in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal, a leading conservative voice, said in an editorial on Monday that he should fix his campaign in the next three weeks or hand over to his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Trump drew heavy criticism after engaging in a prolonged spat with the parents of a Muslim U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq. Last week, he suggested gun rights activists could take action against Clinton, a statement critics found alarming but which he later said was aimed at rallying votes against her. Trump also called Obama and Clinton the \u201cco-founders\u201d of Islamic State, a false claim he later said was sarcastic but did not wholly abandon. Despite Clinton\u2019s lead in polls, Obama warned Democrats against over confidence, telling a fundraising gathering on Monday in Massachusetts, \u201cIf we are not running scared until the day after the election, we are going to be making a grave mistake.\u201d ",

        "title": "Factbox: Trump controversies: Michael Flynn, the travel ban and others",
        "text": "(Reuters) - National security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s resignation under fire was just the latest in a series of controversies that have embroiled the Trump administration since it took office on Jan. 20.  Here are several of the tempests that have swirled around the new White House: Flynn quit on Monday after misleading the White House about his contacts with Russia before taking office and President Donald Trump lost trust in him, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. U.S. lawmakers, including some leading Republicans, called for an investigation. NATIONAL SECURITY AT MAR-A-LAGO Private guests at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida snapped photos of the president and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe conferring and looking at documents while surrounded by aides following a weekend missile launch by North Korea. One guest posted to his Facebook page a picture with a man described to be the holder of the \u201cnuclear football,\u201d or weapons codes. The incidents prompted concerns about national security, and a Republican representative asked the White House for details. Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 27 temporarily banning U.S. entry by travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and all refugees, citing the need to protect Americans. The ban triggered protests across the United States, confusion at U.S. and overseas airports and multiple legal challenges. A federal judge in Seattle on Feb. 3 suspended the ban in an order upheld by a federal appeals court in San Francisco. The Seattle judge\u2019s order drew fire from Trump on Twitter, who criticized the jurist and the court system. The Republican president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, said last week that the Twitter attacks were \u201cdemoralizing\u201d and \u201cdisheartening,\u201d according to a spokesman. Trump said Gorsuch\u2019s comments had been misrepresented. Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway urged Americans last week to buy his daughter Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing and jewelry products during an appearance on a national television program after department store chain Nordstrom Inc said it was dropping them due to a decline in sales. Conway\u2019s endorsement, which followed a Twitter attack by Trump on Nordstrom, prompted criticism from Democrats and Republicans. On Tuesday, the Office of Government Ethics said the White House should investigate whether Conway violated ethics rules. Trump\u2019s nominee to head the Labor Department, fast-food executive Andrew Puzder, admitted on Feb. 7 he employed an illegal immigrant as a house cleaner. Puzder, who already faced strong opposition from Senate Democrats and progressive groups because of his views on labor issues, said he and his wife had employed the housekeeper for a few years without knowing she was not legally permitted to work in the country. He said that when he learned of her status, he and his wife ended her employment and offered her help in getting legal status. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped plans to meet his counterpart in Washington during the second week of Trump\u2019s presidency after Trump tweeted that Mexico should cancel the meeting if it was not prepared to pay for his proposed border wall. Trump abruptly ended a phone call in late January with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, telling the leader of one of the United States\u2019 closest allies that it was the \u201cworst call by far\u201d he had had with a foreign leader, according to the Washington Post. Trump said a deal between the United States and Australia on refugee resettlement was \u201cdumb\u201d and accused Turnbull\u2019s country of trying to export the \u201cnext Boston bombers\u201d under the agreement, the Post said.

        "title": "Trump visits U.S. Supreme Court as justices weigh travel ban",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump visited the Supreme Court on Thursday for the first time since taking office to attend a ceremony for Neil Gorsuch, the justice he appointed, as the court mulls what to do with his blocked ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The president and first lady Melania Trump were present in the marble-clad courthouse for an investiture ceremony formally welcoming Gorsuch to the top U.S. court. Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in as a justice in April and authored his first ruling last week in a debt-collection case. Trump sat near the front of the ornate, burgundy-draped courtroom as Chief Justice John Roberts offered him and the first lady a \u201cwarm welcome\u201d in opening remarks. The president sat quietly as Roberts administered the judicial oath to Gorsuch and joined the crowd in applauding Gorsuch, smiling broadly.  In appointing Gorsuch, Trump restored the court\u2019s 5-4 conservative majority. Trump did not speak at the event. Other notable figures at the ceremony included several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and attorneys general during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency, including John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales. Also attending was Kenneth Starr, the former independent counsel who investigated Bill Clinton during his presidency. A special counsel examining whether Trump\u2019s presidential campaign team colluded with Russia in the 2016 election is now investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice. Trump\u2019s travel ban is now before the justices after being blocked by lower courts. In deciding whether to allow the travel ban to go into effect, the justices are set to weigh whether Trump\u2019s election campaign rhetoric can be used as evidence that the March 6 order was intended to discriminate against Muslims in violation of the Constitution. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign called for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d The court is currently considering an emergency request from Trump\u2019s administration seeking to put the travel ban into effect while litigation continues. Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked Trump\u2019s 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Hawaii judge also blocked a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States. The injunctions blocking the ban were upheld on appeal. Trump was able to make the appointment of Gorsuch only because the Republican-led Senate last year refused to consider former President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to the court, Merrick Garland.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation that would require law enforcement to obtain a search warrant before asking technology companies to hand over old emails unanimously moved forward in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, notching a long-awaited win for technology companies and digital privacy advocates. The House Judiciary Committee voted 28-0 to approve the Email Privacy Act, which would update a decades-old law to mandate federal authorities get a warrant to access emails or other digital communications that are more than 180 days old. Currently, law enforcement and civil agencies can ask a service provider to turn over such aged private communications with only a subpoena, which is subject to less judicial oversight than a warrant. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he planned to bring the bill to a full vote the week of April 25, boosting its chances to become law this year.  If the bill passes the House as expected, it will head to a gridlocked Senate, where more than a quarter of the lawmakers, including No. 2 Republican John Cornyn, has endorsed similar legislation. Debate over law enforcement access to Americans\u2019 electronic communications intensified this year with the Justice Department\u2019s pursuit of a court order to force Apple to help unlock an encrypted iPhone linked to one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters. Prior to Wednesday\u2019s vote, the bill had gained sponsorship from 315 of a possible 435 House lawmakers, making it the most supported bill in the chamber to not earn a vote. Disagreements over whether civil agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission should be allowed to rely on subpoenas continually slowed the bill, which has floated around Congress for several years.     The White House also has said it favors reforming the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act, but it has not endorsed specific legislation. A package of minor amendments from Representative Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the committee, was adopted Wednesday, including the removal of a requirement to serve warrants to the subject of an investigation. The bill requires a warrant to be given only to the email provider. That change and others prompted ire from a coalition of more than 50 civil liberties groups, trade associations and technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft  and Facebook. While maintaining their support, the coalition said in a letter to the committee that the bill \u201cdoes not achieve all of the reforms we had hoped for.\u201d ",

        "title": "Obama moves to lock in vehicle greenhouse gas rules",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday said it will push to lock in fuel efficiency standards central to outgoing President Barack Obama\u2019s climate policy before the Trump administration takes over in January.   Automakers had appealed to President-elect Donald Trump, who has been critical of Obama\u2019s climate policies, to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleet-wide fuel efficiency by 2025, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences.  The EPA under law had to decide by April 2018 whether to modify the 2022-2025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet-wide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon. Instead, the agency said it will end the public comment period by Dec. 30, and could move to lock in the rules after then and before the Obama administration leaves office on Jan. 20.  The EPA in a statement said it concluded after a lengthy review that automakers can meet the 2025 standards. Janet McCabe, EPA acting assistant administrator, told reporters the technical record could \u201carguably support strengthening the 2022 through 2025 standards,\u201d but the EPA believes it \u201cis not the time to introduce uncertainty by changing the standard.\u201d She denied the impending administration change prompted the decision, but the EPA website previously showed a timeline that suggested a decision on mid-term review was not expected until mid-2017. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others, blasted the decision, saying \u201cthis extraordinary and premature rush to judgment circumvents the serious analysis necessary to make sure the (vehicle) standards appropriately balance fuel efficiency, carbon reduction, affordability and employment.\u201d The group said it looked forward to working with the Trump administration on revisions and that \u201cthe evidence is abundantly clear that with low gas prices, consumers are not choosing the cars necessary to comply with increasingly unrealistic standards.\u201d It had previously asked Trump to review the automotive greenhouse gas rules, and other Obama administration actions that enable California and certain other states to mandate sales of electric vehicles. Environmental groups applauded the administration move and said they expect the EPA to finalize the rules by Jan. 20. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like about a plan, agreed to by the automakers, that cuts oil use, saves money at the pump and reduces pollution?\u201d said Daniel Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, a Washington-based group that supports strong climate action. The Republican U.S. Congress or the Trump administration could seek to reverse or modify the rules. However, if the current EPA rules are locked in, it could make doing so more difficult and time consuming. Auto lobbyists said the next administration will have a variety of ways of reversing the EPA action, including reopening the technical assessment report. They also said the Obama administration\u2019s move could backfire by bringing more attention to the issue early in the Trump administration.  Trump\u2019s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In 2011, Obama announced agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 mpg, which the administration said would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. In July, EPA said because Americans are buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks that they now estimate the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025. The agreement included a mid-term review to decide whether the 2022-2025 model year requirements were feasible. The California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols said the EPA decision \u201cprovides solid support for continuation of the single national program to produce a new generation of clean vehicles.\u201d ",

        "title": "Trump wants Postal Service to charge 'much more' for Amazon shipments",
        "text": "SEATTLE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on the U.S. Postal Service on Friday to charge \u201cmuch more\u201d to ship packages for Amazon (AMZN.O), picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past.     \u201cWhy is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.  The president\u2019s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the Postal Service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season.  The U.S. Postal Service, which runs at a big loss, is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses, according to its website.  Package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the Internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first-class letters. The president does not determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos, who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg News. Bezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media. In tweets over the past year, Trump has said the \u201cAmazon Washington Post\u201d fabricated stories. He has said Amazon does not pay sales tax, which is not true, and so hurts other retailers, part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big American companies since he took office in January. Daniel Ives, a research analyst at GBH Insights, said Trump\u2019s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant. However, he said he was not concerned for Amazon. \u201cWe do not see any price hikes in the future. However, that is a risk that Amazon is clearly aware of and (it) is building out its distribution (system) aggressively,\u201d he said. Amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service, including testing drones for deliveries. In 2015, the company spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year.  Amazon shares were down 0.86 percent to $1,175.90 by early afternoon. Overall, U.S. stock prices were down slightly on Friday.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix Inc, which analyzes shipping data, disputed the idea that the Postal Service charges less than United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N), the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the United States. Many customers get lower rates from UPS and FedEx than they would get from the post office for comparable services, he said. The Postal Service delivers about 62 percent of Amazon packages, for about 3.5 to 4 million a day during the current peak year-end holiday shipping season, Jindel said. The Seattle-based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take Amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys, from post offices to customers\u2019 doorsteps. Amazon\u2019s No. 2 carrier is UPS, at 21 percent, and FedEx is third, with 8 percent or so, according to Jindel. Trump\u2019s comment tapped into a debate over whether Postal Service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e-commerce, which has flooded the mail with small packages.Private companies like UPS have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business. Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, noted that the company values its \u201cproductive relationship\u201d with the postal service, but that it has filed with the Postal Regulatory Commission its concerns about the postal service\u2019s methods for covering costs. Representatives for Amazon, the White House, the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on Trump\u2019s tweet. According to its annual report, the Postal Service lost $2.74 billion this year, and its deficit has ballooned to $61.86 billion.  While the Postal Service\u2019s revenue for first class mail, marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining, revenue from package delivery is up 44 percent since 2014 to $19.5 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. But it also lost about $2 billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in April 2016. According to a Government Accountability Office report in February, the service is facing growing personnel expenses, particularly $73.4 billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities. The Postal Service has not announced any plans to cut costs. By law, the Postal Service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service. But the postal service allocates only 5.5 percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is 28 percent of its total revenue. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers launched the next round in their fight against federal regulation on Wednesday, helped by at least one Democrat, as the U.S. Senate began work on legislation to change nearly every step agencies take in creating and applying new rules. Republicans have said they deem lightening federal regulation, which they consider costly and burdensome, as much a priority as overhauling healthcare and rewriting the tax code.  For most of President Donald Trump\u2019s first 100 days, the Republican-led Congress attacked regulation by passing resolutions to wipe some of former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s rules off the books under the Congressional Review Act. Trump also ordered agencies to scrap two existing rules every time they enact a new one. Just before Trump\u2019s January inauguration, the House of Representatives passed the \u201cRegulatory Accountability Act,\u201d combining a half dozen bills to radically change government regulation. On Wednesday, Senator Rob Portman, a Ohio Republican, and Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, introduced a version of the act for that chamber. If it passes, the bill will be combined with the House version for Trump to sign into law. The bill would bring \u201cour outdated federal regulatory process into the 21st Century by requiring agencies to use the best scientific and economic data available, strengthening checks and balances, and giving the public a voice in the process,\u201d Portman said in a statement. It requires stricter cost-benefit analysis, use of the \u201cbest available science\u201d to craft rules, and reviews of regulations, according to a summary. The bill diverges from the House version on what is known as the \u201cChevron Deference,\u201d based on a Supreme Court ruling that courts should defer to agencies\u2019 interpretations of statutes governing their rulemaking. The House legislation eliminates the Chevron Deference, while the Senate one creates a judicial review process where courts can decide if agencies comply with the law and then remand non-compliant rules to agencies. Courts would also review factual determinations used in drafting rules costing more than $1 billion annually. Environmental and labor groups said the Senate bill could block needed new regulations and weaken existing ones.  \u201cThis bill would tilt the scales in favor of polluters at the public\u2019s expense,\u201d said Scott Slesinger, legislative director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cIt would make it virtually impossible to safeguard the public from dirty air, unsafe drinking water and other health threats.\u201d  ",

        "text": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - Unknown attackers torched a car belonging to deputy head of the parliament of Comoros late on Sunday, the latest in a series of threats apparently aimed at derailing an investigation he is leading, the lawmaker said. Dhoulkamal Dhoihir, vice president of the National Assembly, is leading an inquiry into a plan to sell Comoros citizenship to stateless people in Gulf states. The scheme would earn Comoros, an island state off Africa s eastern coast, $200 million to $300 million, but it has been dogged by allegations of corruption. The incident comes a day before the commission Dhoihir heads is due to question two former presidents - Ikililou Dhoinine, who left office last year, and Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi, who launched the citizenship scheme in late 2008.  As I was finishing up my dinner I heard a loud noise and the car alarm go off. I opened the door and saw my car on fire. Everything was destroyed,  Dhoihir told Reuters on Monday.  It was definitely linked to my work. There are lots of people who don t want this information to come out,  he added. Abdoul-Kader Mahmoud, the director of the police, said the investigation was continuing, but officers had not yet identified the cause of the incident.  It could have been a technical problem, but we are not ruling out any explanation,  he told Reuters. Dhoirir said that he had faced threats via social media and a group of MPs have tried to shut down his commission of inquiry, which began work in the summer and is due to submit its report next month. Dhoirir said that the commission had requested extra security after coming under increased pressure as the investigation advanced. None was provided until Sunday night, after the fire, he said. Mahmoud denied commissioners had requested extra security before the incident but said officers had been dispatched to the residences of members of the commission.  We have taken the measures. We have sent more men to protect these people,  he said. Under President Azali Assoumani, the Comoros government has suspended the issuing of new citizenships until the commission completes its work.  This is a very serious incident. Those who risk being exposed are sending a very clear message,  a former top government official said. ",

We need to refute it.\u201d Clinton, the first woman to be nominated for the presidency by a major U.S. party, has rushed to capitalize on Trump\u2019s public feud with Machado, whom he once called \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d because of her weight gain, and make inroads with women voters five weeks before the Nov. 8 election. Clinton\u2019s and Trump\u2019s running mates, Democrat Kaine, a U.S. senator, and Republican Pence, governor of Indiana, will meet in a debate in Farmville, Virginia, starting at 9 p.m. on Tuesday (0100 GMT on Wednesday.)  The debate will provide voters their first extended chance to evaluate the No. 2\u2019s in the White House race and is the only showdown between the vice presidential candidates. Trump and Clinton will meet in their second debate on Sunday. Pence could find himself frequently on the defensive about Trump, a New York businessman who has been dealing with a torrent of bad news in the past week. That includes a New York Times report that Trump took an almost $1 billion loss in 1995 that may have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years. While Democrats have slammed him over the report, Trump, who made much of his business acumen on the campaign trail, has said he \u201cbrilliantly used\u201d U.S. tax rules to his advantage to limit his tax bills. Clinton disagreed, telling reporters on Tuesday it showed \u201cunequivocally\u201d that Trump was a failure at business for losing $1 billion to begin with. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday said 67 percent of Americans believed it was \u201cselfish\u201d for a presidential candidate to pay no taxes, although 46 percent thought a candidate who paid no taxes was \u201csmart.\u201d Clinton also criticized Trump for appearing to suggest on Monday that veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress were not strong enough to handle the stress of war. Trump and his campaign said his words were taken out of context. \u201cWhen people come back from war and combat, and they see things that maybe a lot of folks in this room have seen many times over - and you\u2019re strong and you can handle it - but a lot of people can\u2019t handle it,\u201d Trump told a veterans group on Monday. Clinton said troops deserved a commander in chief who understood their sacrifice. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s comments are not just ignorant, they are harmful because they give voice to the stigma that has led generations of veterans to hide their struggles instead of getting lifesaving help,\u201d she said. On the campaign trail on Tuesday, Trump met with about a dozen energy executives in Denver, querying them mainly about their concerns about regulations he said had \u201cgotten out of control.\u201d John Harpole, chief executive of Mercator Energy, said he did not understand why the Obama administration\u2019s response to the shale boom and Clinton\u2019s energy positions had not come up during the first presidential debate last week. Others told Trump they faced more immediate concerns with state-level regulators. Scott Stewart of Gilbert-Stewart Operating said his company had largely moved operations to Kansas because of stiff rules in Colorado. Trump also reveled in comments on Monday by Clinton\u2019s husband, former President Bill Clinton, who said small-business people and people who make too much to get federal subsidies to help with insurance payments were \u201cgetting killed\u201d by the federal healthcare law known as Obamacare. Trump has promised to repeal Obamacare, while Hillary Clinton has praised it but said she would work to improve aspects of it. \u201cI bet he went through hell last night, can you imagine?\u201d Trump said of Bill Clinton during a rally in Prescott, Arizona. \u201cHe went through hell, but honestly there have been many nights when he has gone through hell with Hillary.\u201d Clinton has led Trump in national opinion polls in recent months. On Tuesday, an average of polls aggregated by RealClearPolitics website showed her with 48.1 percent of support compared with Trump\u2019s 44.3 percent. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration\u2019s push to overhaul tax laws might soon target a loophole used by some financial managers to lower their tax rates, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said on Sunday. President Donald Trump campaigned before the Nov. 8 election to eliminate the so-called \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole, which is used by many financial managers to lower tax obligations. But a rough outline for a major tax overhaul released last week failed to mention the loophole. Priebus, however, hinted that carried-interest could be on the chopping block and warned against analysts taking the view that financial managers would keep on benefiting from it. \u201cThat balloon is going to get popped pretty quick,\u201d Priebus told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d  \u201cCarried interest is on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president wants to get rid of carried interest so that balloon is not going to stay inflated very long, I assure you of that.\u201d The carried interest rule allows financial managers at private equity, hedge fund and other firms to pay a capital gains tax rate on their income instead of the higher income tax rate. Trump\u2019s tax overhaul plan would slash rates for businesses. Vice President Mike Pence told NBC \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday the plan might widen budget deficits \u201cin the short term,\u201d but faster economic growth would eventually lead to higher revenue.

Sally Burch, a British activist and journalist for the Latin American Information Agency, said Argentina had already revoked credentials given to her by the WTO to attend the meeting but thought she would be able to enter the country as a tourist.  They found my name on a list and started asking questions ... supposedly I was a false tourist,  Burch said on Radio 10.  It s not very democratic of Argentina s government.  Petter Titland, the spokesman for the Norweigan NGO Attac Norge, said authorities denied him entry without explaining why. Late last month, Argentina rescinded the credentials of some 60 activists who had been accredited by the WTO to attend the meeting because it determined they would be  more disruptive than constructive.  WTO meetings often attract protests by anti-globalization groups, but they have remained largely peaceful since riots broke out at the 1999 meeting in Seattle. WTO s spokesman, Keith Rockwell, reiterated on Saturday that it disagreed with Argentina s decision to revoke activists  credentials.  We didn t have the same perspective but we re now moving on,  Rockwell told journalists. Argentina s President Mauricio Macri has promoted business-friendly policies since taking office in December 2015, and Argentina will host global events as chair of the G20 group of major economies next year.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate Intelligence Committee, investigating Russian meddling in U.S. 2016 election, has asked President Donald Trump\u2019s political organization to hand over all documents going back the campaign\u2019s launch in June 2015, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing two people briefed on the request.  The letter from the Senate panel seeking all documents, emails and telephone records arrived at Trump\u2019s campaign committee last week and was addressed to its treasurer, the Post said. This marked the first time the Trump campaign organization has been drawn into the bipartisan committee\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election, it said. Dozens of former campaign staffers are expected to be contacted soon to ensure they are aware of the request, the Post said, citing the two people. The letter was signed by Republican Senator Richard Burr, the committee\u2019s chairman, and Senator Mark Warner, its top Democrat, according to the Post, which said representatives for Burr and Warner declined to comment. The Senate panel\u2019s investigation is among several in Congress into Russian interference in the election, and is separate from a probe into the matter being led by a special counsel appointed last week by the Justice Department, former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller. Trump\u2019s campaign committee, based at Trump Tower in New York, is now led by Michael Glassner, a former deputy campaign manager, and John Pence, a nephew of Vice President Mike Pence, the Post said. Glassner did not immediately respond to a request for comment and a White House representative had no immediate comment, the Post said. Trump\u2019s administration has been dogged by concerns about its ties to Russia and questions over whether Trump associates may have cooperated with Russians as they sought to meddle in last year\u2019s election on Trump\u2019s behalf. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trump\u2019s favor. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia. Controversy has engulfed Trump since he fired FBI Director James Comey on May 9 as Comey oversaw an investigation into possible collusion between his presidential campaign and Russia. ",

        "text": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Macau has suspended a pro-democracy lawmaker for alleged  disobedience  after he took to the street instead of staying on a sidewalk during a protest, as activists warn suppression of civil rights is growing in the China-ruled gambling hub. The suspension of the lawmaker is the first since 1999, when the former Portuguese colony returned to China within a  one country, two systems  framework that allows a free press and an independent judiciary, liberties denied on the mainland.  It s a dark day for Macau,  said Jose Coutinho, one of four legislators who voted against the suspension in Monday s secret ballot, which drew 28 votes in favor.  I am sad and disillusioned with this outcome.   There were numerous illegalities in the ballot and the lawmaker, 26-year-old Sulu Sou, should have been given an opportunity to defend himself, Coutinho added. Sou is awaiting trial over a protest in 2016 against a perceived conflict of interest in the transfer of 100 million yuan ($15 million) from the charitable government-linked Macau Foundation to a Chinese university on whose board its chief executive, Fernando Chui, sits.   No date has been set for Sou s trial, but the assembly vote strips him of his duties, and he can only return if he is found not guilty or gets a jail term shorter than 30 days.   Many in Macau fear the decision signals authorities intend  to follow a path similar to that of former British colony Hong Kong, which has jailed several pro-democracy activists, including a lawmaker, Nathan Law, in the past year.  This may be the beginning of the death sentence to Macau s rule of law, and it will end up having an impact in the casino industry,  said Jorge Menezes, a lawyer who has lived in Macau since 1997.  Sou was stripped of his rights to participate in the debate and vote in a clear violation of the assembly s rules,  said Menezes, adding that such violations could apply elsewhere in Macau, including the casino industry. Macau is the world s biggest gambling hub, home to U.S. companies Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts as well as Melco Resorts, Galaxy Entertainment and SJM Holdings.  The casinos have all reaped billions of dollars in the only place where Chinese citizens are allowed to gamble but will be at the mercy of authorities when their licenses start to expire in 2020. Sou, who has challenged the government on several issues since becoming a lawmaker in September, vowed to fight on.  We stick together for the very same goal that put us on this course to fight for justice,  grassroots supporter the New Macau Association, which has stood by him, said on social media site Facebook.

        "title": "As Mattis peers into North Korea, he gets warning on artillery",
        "text": " DEMILITARIZED ZONE, South Korea (Reuters) - As U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis peered into North Korea from a lookout post on Friday, he was given a blunt reminder by his South Korean counterpart of the vast amount of North Korean artillery within range of Seoul.  Above the faint sound of North Korean propaganda music being blasted from across the border, South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo suggested that U.S. and South Korean missile defenses simply could not stop all of them.   Defending against this many LRAs (long-range artillery) is infeasible in my opinion,  Song told Mattis, citing a need for strategies to  offensively neutralize  the artillery in the event of a conflict.  Mattis replied:  Understood.   The brief exchange at the inter-Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - where U.S .President Donald Trump may visit in coming days - spoke volumes about the risks of any miscalculation as tension soars over Pyongyang s rapidly advancing nuclear weapon and missile programs.  Last week, CIA chief Mike Pompeo said North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent.  U.S. intelligence experts say Pyongyang believes it needs the weapons to ensure its survival and have been skeptical about diplomatic efforts, focusing on sanctions, to get Pyongyang to willingly denuclearise.  But, as the DMZ trip highlighted, North Korea s conventional weaponry poses such a risk to South Korea that any attempt to denuclearize the North by force could easily escalate into a devastating conflict.  Mattis was keen to emphasize efforts to peacefully resolve the crisis, including at the DMZ, as he addressed reporters with his back to the dividing line between North and South.   Our goal is not war, but rather the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,  Mattis said, as North Korean soldiers kept watch.  Mattis said he and Song also made clear their mutual commitment  to a diplomatic solution to address North Korea s reckless, outlaw behavior,  when they met this week at a gathering of Asian defense chiefs in the Philippines.  He carried that same message after his helicopter flight back to Seoul, where he addressed a small group of U.S. and South Korean soldiers.  \"It comes down to you to make it work, my fine young troops ... and we'll buy time for our diplomats to solve this problem,\" he said.  The emphasis on diplomacy came before Trump departs next week on a trip to Asia. He has declined to say whether he will visit the DMZ when he stops in South Korea, telling reporters on Wednesday:  You ll be surprised.   Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to destroy North Korea if necessary to defend the United States and its allies. Kim has blasted Trump as  mentally deranged.   The bellicose verbal exchanges have stoked fears of a military confrontation, but White House officials say Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution.  At the same time, the U.S. and South Korean militaries are looking for ways to deter Pyongyang, and bolster its defenses.  As Mattis at one point met some of the roughly 28,000 American forces stationed in South Korea, he said the role of U.S. and South Korean troops was essential.   We re doing everything we can to solve this diplomatically, everything we can. But ultimately our diplomats have to be backed up by strong soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, so they speak from a position of strength,  he said.   So thanks for standing watch, for holding the line.   ",

        "title": "Legal battle over travel ban pits Trump's powers against his own words",
        "text": " NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court is weighing arguments for and against President Donald Trump\u2019s temporary travel ban, but its decision this week may not yet answer the underlying legal questions being raised in the fast-moving case.  The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco is expected to rule only on the narrow question of whether a lower court\u2019s emergency halt to an executive order by Trump was justified. Trump signed the order on Jan. 27 barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days and halted all refugee entries for four months.  The appeals court has several options. It could kick the case back to lower court judge James Robart in Seattle, saying it is premature for them to make a ruling before he has had a chance to consider all the evidence. Robart stopped Trump\u2019s order just a week after he issued it and before all the arguments had been developed on both sides.  Or the panel of three appellate judges could side with the government and find halting the order was harmful to national security, reinstating it while the case continues.  Their decision is \u201cone step in what will be a long, historic case,\u201d Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor at Cornell University Law School who specializes in immigration. Ultimately, the case is likely to end up in the U.S. Supreme Court, legal experts said.  The case is the first serious test of executive authority since Trump became president on Jan. 20, and legal experts said there were three main issues at play for the judiciary.  The broad questions in the case are whether the states have the right to challenge federal immigration laws, how much power the court has to question the president\u2019s national security decisions, and if the order discriminates against Muslims.  Washington state filed the original lawsuit, claiming it was hurt by the ban when students and faculty from state-run universities and corporate employees were stranded overseas.  Trump administration lawyer August Flentje argued at an appeals court hearing on Tuesday that the states lack \u201cstanding\u201d to sue the federal government over immigration law, but his arguments were questioned by the judges.  If the court decides the states are allowed to bring the case, the next major question is about the limits of the president\u2019s power.  \u201cHistorically courts have been exceedingly deferential to governmental actions in the immigration area,\u201d said Jonathan Adler, a Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor. Though, he added, \u201cthe way they carried it out understandably makes some people, and perhaps some courts, uneasy with applying the traditional rules.\u201d  Trump issued the order late on a Friday and caused chaos at airports as officials struggled to quickly change procedures.  At Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Judge Richard Clifton, an appointee of Republican president George W. Bush and Judge William Canby, an appointee of Democratic president Jimmy Carter, pushed the government to explain what would happen if Trump simply decided to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. \u201cWould anybody be able to challenge that?\u201d Canby asked.  Flentje emphasized that the order did not ban Muslims. He said the president made a determination about immigration policy based on a legitimate assessment of risk.  The government has said its order is grounded in a law passed by congress that allows the president to suspend the entry of \u201cany class of aliens\u201d that he deems \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d  When asked by the third judge - Michelle Friedland, appointed by Democrat Barack Obama - if that meant the president\u2019s decisions are \u201cunreviewable\u201d Flentje, after a pause, answered \u201cyes.\u201d When pressed, Flentje acknowledged, however, that constitutional concerns had been raised about the order.  One of the main concerns is allegations by the states, civil rights groups, some lawmakers and citizens that the order discriminates in violation of the constitution\u2019s First Amendment, which prohibits favoring one religion over another.  The judges will have to decide whether to look exclusively at the actual text of the president\u2019s order, which does not mention any particular religion, or consider outside comments by Trump and his team to discern their intent.  Washington state\u2019s attorney Noah Purcell told the hearing that even though the lawsuit is at an early stage, the amount of evidence that Trump intended to discriminate against Muslims is \u201cremarkable.\u201d It cited Trump\u2019s campaign promises of a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d  In a tweet on Monday night, Trump said \u201cthe threat from radical Islamic terrorism is very real\u201d urging the courts to act quickly.  Government lawyer Flentje countered Purcell by saying there was danger in second guessing Trump\u2019s decision-making about U.S. security \u201cbased on some newspaper articles.\u201d  Clifton asked about statements on Fox News by Trump adviser Rudolph Giuliani, former New York mayor and former prosecutor, that Trump had asked him to figure out how to make a Muslim ban legal.  \u201cDo you deny that in fact the statements attributed to then candidate Trump and to his political advisers and most recently Mr. Giuliani?\u201d Clifton asked. \u201cEither those types of statements were made or not,\u201d said Clifton. \u201cIf they were made it is potential evidence.\u201d  ",

        "text": " NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republicans mostly blame the U.S. Congress, and not President Donald Trump or party leaders, for failing to pass their party\u2019s healthcare overhaul, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Wednesday.  The March 25-28 poll asked who should take responsibility for the failure of the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which Republican leaders pulled from consideration last week without a vote.  Besides Trump, who backed the bill, and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who was expected to shepherd it through Congress, the poll asked if people blamed House Republicans, House Democrats or the media.  Republicans were most likely to blame Congress. Some 26 percent said House Democrats were most responsible and 23 percent blamed House Republicans. Another 13 percent blamed Trump and 10 percent blamed Ryan. Only 8 percent blamed the media.\u00a0  Their assessment appeared to align with Trump\u2019s criticism of Democratic leaders and the conservative Freedom Caucus, whom he blamed for the bill\u2019s failure.  Overall, nearly one in four Americans, including Democrats and independents, blamed Trump. Ryan, Congress and the media received less criticism.  The Republican reform was widely criticized after estimates by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office showed 24 million people could lose their health insurance over the next 10 years.  Trump said on Tuesday he still thinks healthcare reform can happen \u201cvery quickly\u201d in Washington, but he did not offer any specifics on how it could get done, or what would be changed from the previous bill.  Nearly half of all Americans said they would like to see that happen, though the response was split along party lines. Some 80 percent of Republicans said they would like to see their party take another swing at a bill, compared with only 25 percent of Democrats.  In a separate poll conducted between Jan.7-23, 46 percent of Americans wanted to keep Obamacare, the popular name for President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare reform, while fixing \u201cproblem areas,\u201d and another 8 percent wanted to keep it exactly as it is.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. The March 25-28 poll included 1,332 people, including 456 Republicans and 558 Democrats. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 5 percentage points for Democrats and Republicans.  \u00a0(Reporting by Chris Kahn, editing by Ross Colvin)  ",

        "title": "Chicago immigrant claims U.S. retaliated over her activism",
        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - A Chicago activist sued U.S. immigration authorities on Wednesday alleging they denied renewal of her immigration status in retaliation for her political activity. Irere Unzueta, 29, who came to the United States from Mexico in 1994 when she was 6 years old, applied for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in 2013 and was granted immigration relief despite a history of arrests at demonstrations. But when she applied last year to renew her DACA status - which allows undocumented immigrants who entered the country before they were 16 to work legally and be exempt from deportation for a two-year period - it was denied. According to the lawsuit against the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency cited Unzueta\u2019s civil disobedience in its explanation of the denial, saying that \u201cMs. Unzueta\u2019s case raised public safety concerns.\u201d The denial \u201cpunishes her for engaging in constitutionally protected, peaceful political actions,\u201d Mony Ruiz Velasco, a lawyer who represented Unzueta in her application for DACA, said at a news conference on Wednesday. Unzueta told reporters she has lost two job opportunities while fighting to renew her immigration status and said she brought the lawsuit because she is worried that hundreds of other students who spoke up about immigration issues could be targeted. She has never been convicted of any crime. The media office at USCIS said they do not comment on individual cases.  President Barack Obama initiated DACA in 2012, and then tried to expand it in 2014. The Supreme Court is considering challenges by a number of states to the expanded DACA and to a separate Obama program that would have granted immigration benefits to parents of children who are legally in the United States. The DACA designation is not a path to permanent resident status but has been controversial because Obama enacted it unilaterally. Unzueta and her family participated in a wave of campaigns around the country to push for DACA. She attended high school in Chicago and graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2009. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, asks the court to find that the immigration authorities erred in denying Unzueta the renewal she sought. Although her application for immigration relief was denied, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has not initiated deportation proceedings against Unzueta.",

        "title": "Northern Ireland parties downbeat on talks as May calls for progress",
        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Northern Ireland s main political parties pointed on Tuesday to fresh obstacles to restoring a devolved power-sharing government in the British region after meeting Prime Minister Theresa May, who urged them to resume talks next week. The province has been without a regional government for almost a year, destabilizing the delicate balance between Irish nationalists and pro-British unionists that has already been shaken by Britain s vote to leave the European Union. The latest efforts at breaking the stalemate in Belfast collapsed this month, prompting Britain to begin setting a budget for the province, a major step toward imposing direct rule from London for the first time in a decade. The head of the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Arlene Foster accused Irish nationalist rival Sinn Fein - the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army - of the  glorification of terrorism  in a party conference last weekend.  Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams in turn accused May of  acting in bad faith  by including a potential statute of limitations covering crimes by British forces in a planned consultation on new laws to deal with the legacy of Northern Ireland s 30 years of sectarian violence. May struck a more positive tone, saying the issues dividing the parties were relatively few and that she believed an agreement could be reached. In Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said that if an administration could not be formed, he would seek a meeting in the New Year of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference, a joint decision making body recognizing the Irish government s special interest in Northern Ireland that last met a decade ago.    Analysts have said a fresh round of talks is unlikely to be even contemplated until after both parties  annual conferences, culminating with the DUP s meeting on Saturday. The DUP has said it was upset by prolonged cheering at Sinn Fein s annual conference at the weekend after MP Elisha McCallion spoke of former Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness  pride in his role in the IRA.  The IRA killed hundreds in its campaign against British rule before a ceasefire in 1994. Around 3,600 died on all sides in the conflict, fought over whether Northern Ireland should be part of the United Kingdom or Ireland, before it ended with a 1998 peace agreement.  It was quite disgraceful to look at the glorification that happened at the weekend of the IRA and terrorism and of course that makes it more difficult for us,  Foster, whose father narrowly escaped alive from an IRA shooting, told reporters. Foster, who warned ahead of the talks that further steps toward direct rule looked inevitable unless there is a change of direction, said her party remained committed to devolution. ",

        "text": "QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - A suicide bombing at a shrine in southwest Pakistan killed 18 people and wounded more than 30 on Thursday in the latest sectarian attack in Baluchistan province, authorities said.  Minority Islamic groups in the province are routinely attacked by militant outfits including Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for several bombings.      A police officer apprehended the bomber at the entrance to the Sufi shrine and was among those killed, but his heroic action reduced the number of casualties, Baluchistan home minister Sarfraz Bugti told Reuters.  Local government official Ahmed Aziz Tarrar said 16 people were killed and over 30 wounded in the blast.   We have received 16 bodies at the local hospital and many injured. The severely wounded are being moved to other facilities,  district heath official Rukhsani Magsi said.  Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack via its Amaq news service. The shrine in the district of Jhal Magsi was packed with devotees mourning the death of a local spiritual leader.  Such incidents fuel concern about security for projects in the $57 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a planned transport and energy route from western China to Baluchistan s deep-water port of Gwadar. The province has been rocked by violence on two fronts for over a decade. As well as the Taliban and other Sunni Islamist militants, Baluchistan separatists mount attacks on targets linked to the central government.  A suicide bomber killed 52 people and wounded over 100 at a Baluchistan Sufi shrine in November last year, in an attack claimed by Islamic State. In February, IS attacked a Sufi shrine in Pakistan s southern Sindh province, killing 83 people. ",

        "text": "LUANDA (Reuters) - The leader of Angola s main opposition party called on the country s electoral commission on Saturday to explain how it compiled provisional election results giving the ruling MPLA party a landslide victory. Isaias Samakuva said his UNITA party, which has rejected the published results of Wednesday s national ballot, was conducting a parallel count using polling station records and computer software that did not tally with the commission s figures.  Where did those results come from?  Samakuva asked supporters at the party s campaign headquarters in Luanda.  The CNE (commission) must explain to Angolans what it did wrong and why it did it.  Based on nearly 98 percent of the vote counted, CNE figures announced on Friday put the People s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) on 61.1 percent and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) on 26.7 percent. Definitive results may not be announced until Sept. 6. International observers described the election as reasonably free and fair and the mood in Luanda has remained calm. UNITA said the results released so far were not legally binding and it would release its national tally early next week.  The country still doesn t have a President-elect,  Samakuva said. President-in-waiting Joao Lourenco, a former defense minister, is set to become the country s first new leader for 38 years, replacing Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who will continue as head of the MPLA. UNITA and smaller opposition party CASA-CE say the provisional results were processed without input from provincial counting centers or certain representatives on the electoral commission, going against Angolan law. The commission has said the process of vote-counting was  going well  but has not extensively explained how provisional numbers were tallied.  Even if the parties have summary records of the polling stations and minutes of electoral operations, it is necessary to realize there is another set of elements and documents that will contribute to the provincial and national tally and this information is not available to the parties,  commission spokeswoman Julia Ferreira said on Friday, without elaborating. UNITA published on Friday its parallel count for four provinces   Huambo, Bie, Cabinda and Luanda   which in all cases showed the party doing better than the commission results indicated. The MPLA, which emerged victorious over UNITA after 27 years of civil war in 2002, has dismissed the complaints, saying its old foe always take issue with election results.  ",

        "title": "U.S. lawmakers push Yucca nuclear dump facing transport crunch",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday debated resurrecting the stalled Yucca Mountain spent nuclear fuel dump in Nevada, a project critics say is hindered by the lack of an easy transport route. Representative John Shimkus, an Illinois Republican, has proposed draft legislation to restart the licensing of Yucca Mountain. The government has already spent billions of dollars for initial construction of the project, which has been pending since Ronald Reagan was president. Former President Barack Obama opposed Yucca and stopped its licensing process in 2010. But President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed 2018 budget provides $120 million to restart licensing and for development of interim nuclear waste sites until Yucca can be completed. More details about the Trump administration\u2019s support of Yucca could come when a broader budget is released in May. Currently, spent nuclear fuel, which can be deadly if left unshielded, is stored at reactors across the country, first in cooling ponds and then in thick casks.  The Yucca site itself, about 100 miles (160 km) northwest of Las Vegas, faces a cumbersome and costly licensing process that could take years to complete and questions from critics about how long spent fuel can remain without radiation leaking into an aquifer. Yucca supporters say there is little groundwater at the desert site and what is there is contained by barriers and does not flow to any river or drinking water supply. An even trickier problem will be getting the spent fuel to Yucca Mountain safely by train and truck from nuclear reactors sites all across the country. \u201cTransportation is the Achilles heel of the Yucca Mountain repository site,\u201d said Bob Halstead, the head of Nevada\u2019s agency for nuclear projects.  One train route studied by the Department of Energy, known as Caliente, has been at least partially blocked by Obama\u2019s 2015 designation of a national monument called Basin and Range. Another route, known as Mina, is opposed by the Walker River tribe, which withdrew permission in 2007 for the government to ship waste through its reservation. Many casino owners and gaming associations also oppose the transport of spent nuclear fuel near the city of Las Vegas, saying publicity about the shipments could harm property values and tourism. The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission has pointed out that nuclear waste has been transported safely in the country for more than 40 years, which Yucca backers are quick to cite. Shimkus, whose state of Illinois has more reactors than any other, says Yucca is ideal because of its remoteness. There are no nuclear power reactors in Nevada, and the state\u2019s entire Congressional delegation, which includes members of both parties, opposes Yucca.  Representative Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, said a major accident would harm human health, cost hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup costs, and damage the Las Vegas economy.   \u201cDo you honestly believe that shipping over 5,000 truck casks of high-level nuclear waste over a span of 50 years won\u2019t result in at least one radiological accident?\u201d Rosen said at the hearing.  The bill contains a measure directing the energy secretary to consider routes avoiding Las Vegas. But the provision is unenforceable under existing laws, Halstead said. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, a Republican, met with Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Washington on Wednesday. Sandoval said he reiterated his opposition to Yucca and urged Perry to explore a \u201crealistic, safe alternative,\u201d to the U.S. nuclear waste problem. ",

        "title": "Trump talks up 'New York values' as protesters demonstrate against him",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican front-runner Donald Trump on Thursday talked up \u201cNew York values\u201d and urged his home state voters to give him a big win next week, but his rivals warned nominating Trump could lead to disastrous losses to the Democrats in the Nov. 8 election. The New York billionaire is in danger of being forced to try to capture the Republican presidential nomination through a contested convention because opposition from rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich is chipping away at his lead. As protesters chanted outside and waved signs against Trump, Trump told the New York state Republican Party\u2019s gala that he needs the momentum that a victory in the state\u2019s primary would bring next Tuesday. \u201cNew York is so important,\u201d Trump said, trying to regain the momentum he lost after Cruz defeated him in Wisconsin last week and captured all of Colorado\u2019s delegates. Trump identified himself with \u201cNew York values\u201d of hard work and compassion after Cruz charged Trump\u2019s version of these values are basically Democratic positions. Whether Trump can win the 1,237 delegates he needs for the nomination is an open question as both Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, and Ohio Governor Kasich, try to block him from getting enough delegates. They want to extend the fight to a contested convention in Cleveland when Republicans gather to formally choose their nominee in July. In his speech to the group, Kasich tried to raise questions about Trump without mentioning his name. He said Republican candidates across the country would be at risk with a candidate with a negative message at the top of the ballot. Trump has drawn many protests for policy positions that include building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, deporting 11 million illegal immigrants and banning Muslims temporarily from entering the United States. \u201cWe risk losing everything from the White House to the courthouse to the state house if we don\u2019t advance a positive, uplifting, unifying message to this country. That is what we need to do,\u201d said Kasich, who spoke after Trump. Cruz, speaking after Kasich, continued the theme, pointing to polls showing Trump losing badly to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and getting far less support from women and minority voters. Cruz presented himself as a unity candidate who can bring the various wings of the party together. \u201cIf we nominate a candidate who loses to Hillary Clinton by double digits, who loses to women by 20 points, who loses Hispanics by 40 points, who loses young people, we cannot win in the general (election),\u201d said Cruz. Before the event started in the Grand Hyatt hotel near Grand Central Station, a group of protesters stormed the hotel mezzanine with a banner that read: \u201cNYC Rejects the Party of Hate.\u201d Eleven of them were reported arrested. Outside the hotel, many anti-Trump demonstrators called the New York billionaire businessman a fascist or white supremacist. They even teased him about his signature hairdo. \u201cWe Shall Over Comb,\u201d read one sign. Others said: \u201cDeport Trump,\u201d \u201cNo allegiance for Trump,\u201d and \u201cBlack lives matter.\u201d A series of speakers addressed the protest crowd with a loudspeaker. Police set up portable barriers to keep protesters separated from traffic and allow pedestrians to pass on busy 42nd Street.  \u201cAlthough Trump is from here, there is no place for him here,\u201d said one of the speakers, Nabil Hassein, 27, of the group Millions March NYC.  Kasich scored a victory with the endorsement of former New York Governor George Pataki, an unsuccessful candidate for the  Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election.The Trump campaign got some good news when a Florida prosecutor announced that Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, would not be prosecuted on a misdemeanor battery charge involving a reporter he was accused of grabbing at an event last month.

The sergeant first class, who transitioned to living as a man while on active duty, said getting kicked out of the military two years before his planned retirement could mean losing many of his pension and healthcare benefits, and even harm his chances of being hired again. \u201cWhy serve a country that doesn\u2019t want me? It breaks my heart, to be honest,\u201d said St. Andrew, 37, of Indianapolis. Despite the devastating effect Trump\u2019s move could have on him, he said he was more concerned about younger soldiers who were earlier in their careers and transition. \u201cYou pull that rug out from under them after they have this false sense of security, that could really throw them into a downward spiral,\u201d he said.  The Republican president\u2019s announcement, made through a series of Twitter posts, upended years of efforts to eliminate barriers to military service on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Just last year, the Pentagon ended a prohibition keeping transgender people from serving openly. Trump, who cited \u201ctremendous medical costs and disruption\u201d  for the ban, did not specify how it would be implemented. It remained unclear whether the policy would apply to existing transgender service members or new transgender recruits.  The president\u2019s action was condemned by rights groups and some lawmakers in both parties, who called it discrimination with purely political motives. The move was praised by conservative activists and some Republicans. \u201cI have a lot of service members that are scared that their careers are over with,\u201d said Navy Lieutenant Commander Blake Dremann, who leads a support organization working with actively serving transgender military members. \u201cRight now, they still have their jobs and we will continue to work to make sure that policy doesn\u2019t change.\u201d The Pentagon said only that it was working on developing guidance following Trump\u2019s tweets. St. Andrew said he did not know he was transgender when he enlisted, eager to serve his country after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. After an impoverished childhood in a small town in Michigan, he wanted to give back to the nation whose welfare system had kept him clothed and fed. Several years into his military service, he began reflecting on his gender identity. He said he struggled with the anxiety that accompanied the fear of being outed and losing his job. \u201cThey pound into you this thing of selfless service,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you do that for a few years, and then you come out socially or to a few close people and that gives you some relief, but you still have to hide what you are.\u201d He said he received support from his commanders and peers through his transition and found that few accommodations were needed. He already was discreet in changing facilities and had trained for the male physical fitness requirements. Still, anticipating changes like Trump\u2019s ban coming, St. Andrew resigned from full-time service after the November election. He now wonders if his part-time reservist status is in jeopardy. \u201cI try to be tough about it,\u201d he said, but added: \u201cIt breaks your spirit down.\u201d \u201cTransgender people are serving today knowing that their leader frankly doesn\u2019t trust them,\u201d said retired Colonel Sheri Swokowski, 67, of Windsor, Wisconsin, the highest-ranking openly transgender veteran. \u201cThe bottom line is that this does great harm to people who simply want to serve their country.\u201d Sergeant Sam Hunt, an electrician serving in the Nevada Army National Guard, said people had long referred to him as a man. He thought he could serve openly as such after former Democratic President Barack Obama lifted the transgender ban. Earlier this month, he learned that the Department of Defense had approved his transition to male from female. \u201cUntil told otherwise, I will continue serving this nation and state, as I have since 2009,\u201d he said in a statement.

        "text": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Approximately two hundred men held in a remote Australian-run detention center will be moved to a new facility within weeks, the country s immigration minister said. Peter Dutton, Australia s immigration minister, said those men who have their refugee applications denied, ruling them ineligible for resettlement to the United States, and who are from countries such as Iran which precludes forced deportations, will be transferred to a new detention facility within Papua New Guinea (PNG) after Oct. 31.  Those people, who total about 200, who have been found not to be refugees are to be moved into an alternative place of detention away from the regional processing center,  Dutton told Australia s parliament. Dutton s comments mark the first insight into how Australia plans to manage the end of its policy of detaining asylum seekers in PNG, where 800 men are held, many of whom for four years. Canberra s hardline immigration policy requires asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia to be sent for processing at camps on PNG s Manus Island and on Nauru. They are told they will never be settled in Australia. Question marks remain, however, about the fate of the remaining men on Manus as a refugee swap deal with the United States stalls. Former U.S. President Barack Obama late last year agreed to resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held in Australian immigration centers in PNG and Nauru. In exchange, Australia agreed to take Central American refugees. Australia had hoped the men would have been resettled by Oct. 31 but with the swap deal stalling under President Trump after the U.S. hit it annual intake cap, Canberra is left seeking a solution. Australia s security contract with Spanish company Ferrovial SA will expire on Oct. 31, forcing the closure of the camp that has been subject to violence from locals.  PNG officials have sought to transfer the men to a transit center nearby but nearly all, citing fears of violence, have refused despite threats that it may rule them out of U.S. resettlement.  We are not willing to move from the center unless we are leaving for a country that is safe,  said one, who declined to be identified because of the fear it would jeopardize his application for U.S. resettlement.

        "text": "BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand s foreign ministry, in a rare statement on an ongoing crisis in neighboring Myanmar s Rakhine state, said late on Saturday that it was  closely following the situation  and would provide aid to the governments of Myanmar and Bangladesh. Violence erupted in Rakhine last month when Rohingya militants attacked security posts, triggering a crackdown by the Myanmar army. More than half a million ethnic Rohingya - a mostly Muslim minority who are denied citizenship by Myanmar - have fled to Bangladesh since then. Those who fled accuse Myanmar s army, backed by Buddhist mobs, of a brutal killing campaign. The United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing a sweeping government offensive in the north of Rakhine State in response to those attacks.  Thailand is closely following the situation in the Rakhine State with concern,  the ministry said.  The Royal Thai Government has always placed great importance to providing care and protection to Myanmar displaced persons,  it added, pointing to some 100,000 refugees from Myanmar who live in nine camps along the Thai-Myanmar border. But many of those living in the camps are long-term residents who fled conflict decades ago. None are Rohingya, according to non-governmental organizations who work there. The Thai foreign ministry said its statement was in response to views raised by some human rights groups regarding Thailand s position on the unrest in Rakhine. Amnesty International last week said Thailand must not  push back  Rohingya fleeing violence and that it should provide refugees formal legal status and protection. Thailand does not recognize the status of any refugees or recognize the Rohingya as legitimate migrant workers. Thailand said it supported a statement on the issue by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a grouping of 10 nations. In the statement, ASEAN foreign ministers condemned the attacks on Myanmar s security forces and  all acts of violence which resulted in loss of civilian lives . Malaysia, an ASEAN member, disassociated itself from the statement, saying it misrepresented issues relating to the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya. So far,  none of the affected victims from the August unrest in Rakhine State have been found in Thailand,  the Thai foreign ministry said. ",

        "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - The United States will propose that President Barack Obama visits Hiroshima, Japan\u2019s Nikkei newspaper said on Friday, in what would be the first visit by an incumbent U.S. president to the city devastated by a U.S. nuclear attack 71 years ago. Citing an unidentified senior U.S. government official, the business daily said Washington planned to propose to Tokyo a visit by the president on May 27, at the end of a Group of Seven (G7) summit hosted by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In Washington, a White House official said no decision has been made.  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga denied the visit was being arranged and declined further comment. Diplomatic protocol means any announcement should come from the U.S. side. \u201cIt is not true that a visit to Hiroshima by President Obama is being arranged between the United States and Japan,\u201d Suga told a regular news conference.  \u201cThe schedule of the U.S. president is a matter for the United States to decide. The (Japanese) government will refrain from comment.\u201d A U.S. warplane dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, killing thousands of people instantly and about 140,000 by the end of that year. Nagasaki was bombed on Aug. 9, 1945, and Japan surrendered six days later. A presidential visit would be controversial in the United States if it were seen as an apology. A majority of Americans view the bombing of Hiroshima and  Nagasaki as justified to end the war and save U.S lives. The vast majority of Japanese think the bombings were unjustified. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said during a visit to the city this month that Obama wanted to travel there, although he did not know if the president\u2019s schedule when he visited Japan for the May 26-27 summit would allow him to. Hiroshima bombing survivors, and other residents, have said they hope for progress in ridding the world of nuclear weapons, rather than an apology, if Obama makes the historic visit. Hopes for Obama\u2019s visit to Hiroshima were raised after a speech in April 2009 in Prague when he called for a world without nuclear weapons. He later said he would be honored to visit the two cities that suffered nuclear attack. Kerry, who toured the Hiroshima Peace Memorial and Museum, called its haunting displays \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d and said everyone should visit. The displays include photographs of badly burned victims, the tattered and stained clothes they wore and statues depicting them with flesh melting from their limbs. ",

        "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - France s hardline CGT union on Wednesday said it would not join the far-left party of Jean-Luc Melenchon in Sept. 23 protests against labor reform in a sign that opposition to President Emmanuel Macron s plan is divided. The union will instead march next week, its leader Philippe Martinez told Paris Match magazine. France s second-largest union the CGT and Melenchon s France Unbowed party are the main opponents of the plan, which includes a cap on payouts for dismissals adjudged unfair and greater freedom for employers to hire and fire.  The largest and third-largest union, the CFDT and FO, have said they would not take to the streets.  The CGT is independent from political parties,  Martinez said. He held a rare meeting with Melenchon on Wednesday. Opinion polls show voters do not like the reforms overall but back most of its individual measures, including direct negotiations between bosses and their staff in small firms. Many in the conservative Republicans party, the biggest opposition bloc in parliament, back the reform.  The CGT can mobilize tens of thousands of activists and its absence could impact turnout for Melenchon s rally. The union lost its position in March as France s biggest. France Unbowed has 17 lawmakers and so can do little to block reforms in the 577-strong parliament but Melenchon is popular and attracted 19.6 percent of the votes in the first round of the presidential election in April. The rally is a key test of the party s capacity to mobilize voters against Macron. Forty-five percent of voters say Melenchon s party is Macron s strongest opponent, more than twice the figure for the Republicans or the far-right National Front, an Ifop-Fiducial poll showed on Tuesday.

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday announced a citywide advertising campaign supporting a person\u2019s right to use bathrooms corresponding with his or her gender identity, wading into a debate that has pitted more than a dozen states against the federal government. The advertisements, which de Blasio described as the nation\u2019s first government-sponsored citywide campaign of its kind, will appear in subway cars, at bus stops, on phone booths and in both online and traditional publications. The ads feature transgender New Yorkers and encourage residents to \u201clook past pink and blue,\u201d among other messages. In March, de Blasio signed an executive order ensuring that transgender people can use the bathroom of their choice in any city-owned building without being asked for identification by employees. City law already allows transgender individuals to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. \u201cWhile other cities and states are legislating intolerance and taking away individuals\u2019 right to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity, we are proudly standing with our transgender and gender non-conforming New Yorkers,\u201d de Blasio, a Democrat, said in a statement. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in May released guidance telling public schools across the United States that they must allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. The letter, which offered the U.S. government\u2019s interpretation of anti-discrimination law, contained the implicit threat of cutting off federal funding for schools that do not comply.  Officials from more than a dozen states have either sued or plan to sue the Obama administration, challenging the directive as unconstitutional. North Carolina and the U.S. Department of Justice exchanged federal lawsuits last month over the state\u2019s law banning people from using bathrooms that do not correspond to their gender of their birth.

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico, struggling to make its debt payments, outlined an increase in its financing gap on Monday, saying it now projects a $16.06 billion hole to fill, cumulatively, over the next five years, an increase of $2.1 billion from a September projection. The Government Development Bank said in an updated Fiscal and Economic Growth Plan (FEGP) released on Monday that at the request of creditors, it had added a 10-year financing gap projection. It now estimates its debt financing hole to grow to $23.9 billion through 2025. Facing over $70 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, Puerto Rico is trying to solve an economic crisis before it hits substantial debt payments in May and July. It has defaulted on some of its debt and is trying to persuade creditors to take concessions. The increases in the financing gaps occur, \u201ceven with the inclusion of economic growth and the implementation of all of the proposed measures in the FEGP,\u201d the Government Development Bank (GDB) said in a separate statement. \u201cSince the release of the FEGP in September, the fiscal and humanitarian crisis on the Island has worsened, and the Commonwealth is now facing even larger estimated financing gaps in both the near and long term. Specifically, the General Fund revenues included in the FEGP have decreased from a previous estimate of $9.46 billion for FY (fiscal year) 2016 to $9.21 billion,\u201d the GDB said. GDB said that as of Jan. 10, it had $667 million of total net liquidity and $535 million in debt service payments during the next 6 months. \u201cAs previously indicated, we expect to sit with our creditors shortly and put forth a comprehensive restructuring proposal,\u201d Melba Acosta, President of the GDB said in the statement. Puerto Rico, as a commonwealth of the United States with 3.5 million people, is not allowed to restructure its debt under existing bankruptcy law. It has sought unsuccessfully to convince the U.S. Congress to vote for a change. However, in one development highlighted on Monday by its representative to Congress, Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico\u2019s hospitals will now receive the same basic reimbursement rate, known as the base rate, by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). This was included in the budget passed by the U.S. Congress in December. \u201cThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that, as a result of this legislative change, Puerto Rico hospitals will receive $618 million more in federal reimbursement payments between 2016 and 2025, an average of over $60 million per year,\u201d said a statement released by Pierluisi on Monday.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday formally dropped plans to hear the last remaining challenge to an earlier version of President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries and a ban on refugees, but a fight over the legality of his latest restrictions still could reach the nine justices. The high court said it will not hear the case brought by Hawaii over the bans, which have expired and been replaced with revised policies. Trump\u2019s 120-day ban on refugees ended on Tuesday and is set to be replaced by a new set of restrictions. Two lower courts have blocked Trump\u2019s new ban targeting people from eight countries, Trump\u2019s third set of travel restrictions, and the issue could find its way back to the Supreme Court on appeal. The court on Oct. 10 disposed of the first of two travel ban cases \u2014 brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and others in Maryland \u2014 after Trump\u2019s earlier 90-day ban on people entering the U.S. from six predominantly Muslim countries expired on Sept. 24. It was a replaced with a modified, open-ended ban involving eight countries. The justices had been scheduled to hear arguments in the two consolidated on Oct. 10. Among the issues raised by challengers was whether the travel ban discriminated against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring a particular religion. The same arguments are being used against the new ban. Trump has said the restrictions were needed to prevent terrorism in the United States. The expired ban had targeted people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. The new ban removed Sudan from the list and blocked people from Chad and North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela from entering the United States. If the new restrictions go into effect, they could block tens of thousands of potential immigrants and visitors to the United States. Trump had promised as a candidate \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d ",

        "text": "KABUL (Reuters) - The Afghan capital Kabul braced on Saturday for further possible attacks ahead of Ashura, the holiest day on the Shi ite Muslim calendar, a day after an attack claimed by Islamic State that killed at least five people near a large Shi ite mosque. Ahead of the celebration on Sunday, signs of increased security were in evidence across Kabul, with extra police checkpoints and roadblocks in many areas, while security was also increased in other cities. Afghanistan, a majority Sunni Muslim country, has traditionally not suffered the sectarian violence that has devastated countries like Iraq, but a series of attacks over recent years have targeted the Shi ite community.  We are concerned about this. We had internal fighting in the past but never religious fighting,  said Arif Rahmani, a member of parliament and a member of the mainly Shi ite Hazara community that has been particularly targeted. The government has provided some basic training and weapons for a few hundred volunteer guards near mosques and other meeting places but many fear that the protection, which covers only some of the city s more than 400 Shi ite mosques, is insufficient. In 2011, more than 80 people were killed in Ashura attacks in Kabul and the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif and there have been a string of others since, with 20 people killed in a suicide attack on a mosque in Kabul a month ago. Friday s attack, by suicide bombers posing as shepherds walking their sheep along a road outside the Hussainya mosque in the Qala-e-Fatehullah area of the city, did not reach the mosque itself but wounded 20 people in addition to the five killed. No up-to-date census data exists for Afghanistan but different estimates put the size of the Shi ite community at between 10-20 percent of the population, mostly Persian-speaking Tajiks and Hazaras. Ashura, on the 10th day of the month of Muharram, celebrates the martyrdom of Hussein, one of the grandsons of the Prophet Mohammad, and is marked by large public commemorations by Shi ite Muslims. President Ashraf Ghani condemned Friday s attack and said it would not break the unity between religions in Afghanistan. But at a time when rivalry between the patchwork of different ethnic groups in the country has increasingly come into the open, Rahmani said the evident objective of the attacks was to ratchet up the tensions to create instability.  In the past, there were warnings that there were groups that wanted to stir ethnic and religious conflict among Afghans but now it is reality,  Rahmani said.  There are people who want to create disunity among ethnic and religious groups,  he said. ",

        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China must step up vigilance against plots to grab power, as political corruption is the worst form of corruption, Wang Qishan, the country s still influential former top graft-buster, wrote on Tuesday. Wang, a key ally of President Xi Jinping, stepped down in a leadership reshuffle last month at the end of the five-yearly Communist Party Congress, but could assume a new role, say sources with ties to the leadership, though an announcement  might not come for a few more weeks.  As the feared head of the party s anti-corruption watchdog for the past five years, Wang has spearheaded Xi s battle on graft, overseeing the jailing of dozens of former top officials, including the domestic security chief, Zhou Yongkang. China has rebuffed criticism that the corruption campaign is as much about settling political scores as about stamping out genuine criminal acts.  Writing in the party s official People s Daily, Wang said the fight against corruption went beyond battling the pilfering of assets or hedonism and was a political battle.   Political corruption is the biggest corruption,  Wang wrote in comments drawn from a collection of essays released after the congress, but not previously published in full by state media.  The collection included pieces by former members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the height of power in China. Aspects of political corruption include the formation of special interest groups to try and seize power, and the organization of  activities outside party parameters, aimed at breaking party unity, Wang wrote.  There are many new historical special characteristics to carrying on this great fight, the most important of which are to ... prevent them from seizing political power and changing the party s basic character,  he added. Wang explicitly linked some of the most notorious cases to political crimes, mentioning not only Zhou but also the former party bosses of the southwestern city of Chongqing, Bo Xilai and Sun Zhengcai, two former top generals and a former top aide to retired president Hu Jintao. In these cases, the party had  eradicated interest groups which mixed political and economic corruption , Wang wrote. Bo was jailed for life in 2013, while Sun was put under investigation for corruption in July. There can be no challenges to the party s power, Wang added.  North, south, east, west and at the center, the party leads everything. If there is no forceful and strong leadership by the party, then the Chinese people are simply a loose plate of sand.  ",

        "title": "Trump vows to end prohibition on church political activity",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday vowed to free churches and other tax-exempt institutions of a 1954 U.S. law banning political activity, drawing fire from critics who accused him of rewarding his evangelical Christian supporters and turning houses of worship into political machines. As Trump used a prayer breakfast to take aim at a long-standing statutory barrier between politics and religion called the Johnson Amendment, civil liberties and gay rights groups expressed concern that he might consider an executive order to allow government agencies and businesses to deny services to gay people in the name of religious freedom. Trump did not reference such an order in his remarks. But he lambasted the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits tax-exempt organizations such as churches and other places of worship, charities and educational institutions from directly or indirectly participating in any political campaign in favor or against a political candidate.  \u201cI will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution. I will do that, remember,\u201d Trump told U.S. politicians, religious leaders and guests including Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah at the annual National Prayer Breakfast. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Trump wanted to find ways to make sure people were not penalized for following through on their religious beliefs.  A draft executive order on \u201creligious freedom\u201d circulating among advocacy groups would allow government officials to deny marriage licenses to gay couples and let businesses withhold services from gay people, activists said.  The White House said it was not working on such an order. Trump previously spoke out against the Johnson amendment during the campaign and won the support of evangelical Christian leaders including Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. A change in the law would require action in the Republican-led U.S. Congress, and Republican lawmakers introduced legislation that would reverse the policy. After Trump\u2019s remarks, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters he has \u201calways supported\u201d eliminating the Johnson Amendment. Critics including the group Americans United for Separation of Church and State expressed alarm. \u201cPresident Donald Trump and his allies in the religious right seek to turn America\u2019s houses of worship into miniature political action committees,\u201d said the group\u2019s executive director, Barry Lynn. \u201cIt would also lead some houses of worship to focus on supporting candidates in exchange for financial and other aid. That would be a disaster for both churches and politics in America,\u201d Lynn said. Peter Montgomery of the liberal advocacy group People For the American Way said Trump wants to pay back religious conservatives who helped get him elected \u201cby letting them turn their churches into political machines with tax-exempt charitable dollars.\u201d Scrapping the Johnson Amendment has been a goal of Christian conservatives, who contend it violates free speech and religious freedom rights. The U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment guarantees freedom of religion and bars the government from establishing an official religion. \u201cWe are encouraged to see that President Trump understands the very real constitutional violation posed by the Johnson Amendment and that he is committed to restoring a pastor\u2019s right to speak freely from the pulpit without fearing government retribution,\u201d said Erik Stanley, senior counsel for the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom. Trump used the opening moments of the usually solemn prayer breakfast to deride actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, his successor on a reality TV show, for his viewership ratings.  Trump said Schwarzenegger, the Republican former governor of California, had disastrous ratings on the NBC reality TV program \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d which Trump previously starred in. \u201cThey hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place. And we know how that turned out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a total disaster. ... And I want to just pray for Arnold if we can, for those ratings, OK?\u201d Schwarzenegger, who endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich over Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, shot back, alluding to the controversies of Trump\u2019s first two weeks in office. \u201cHey Donald, I have a great idea,\u201d Schwarzenegger said in a video. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we switch jobs? You take over TV, because you\u2019re such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job. And then people can finally sleep comfortably again.\u201d Spicer later called Trump\u2019s remarks \u201clight-hearted\u201d and part of an \u201cabsolutely beautiful\u201d speech. Trump a week ago put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Trump defended his directive on Thursday as crucial to ensuring religious freedom and tolerance in America, and said he wanted to prevent a \u201cbeachhead of intolerance\u201d from spreading in the United States. He also called terrorism a fundamental threat to religious freedom. \u201cThe world is in trouble, but we\u2019re going to straighten it out. OK? That\u2019s what I do. I fix things,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen you hear about the tough phone calls I\u2019m having, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Trump added, apparently referring to telephone conversations including one with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \u201cIt\u2019s time we\u2019re going to be a little tough folks. We\u2019re taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore,\u201d Trump said. ",

        "title": "Merkel tries to build coalition after vote that puts far right in parliament",
        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s Angela Merkel began the tough task of trying to build a government on Monday after securing a fourth term as chancellor, urging the center-left Social Democrats not the shut the door on a re-run of their  grand coalition . Damaged by her decision two years ago to allow more than one million migrants into Germany, Merkel s conservative bloc secured 33 percent of the vote, losing 8.5 points   its lowest level since 1949. Her coalition partners, the center-left Social Democrats, also slumped and said they would go into opposition.   Voters flocked to the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD), the first far-right party to enter the German parliament in more than half a century. However, the AfD hardly had time to savor its third-place showing before it fell into internal bickering.   Many Germans see the rise of the AfD as a similar rejection of the status quo as votes for Brexit and Donald Trump last year. But Germany s political center held up better than in Britain and the United States as more voters have benefited from globalization and most shun the country s extremist past. Merkel s party remained the biggest parliamentary bloc and Europe s most powerful leader sought to keep her coalition options open on Monday, saying she would start talks with the  Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens as well as the SPD. SPD leader Martin Schulz said earlier his party had no choice but to go into opposition  to defend democracy against those who question it and attack it,  after dropping to a post-war low of 20.5 percent.  I heard the SPD s words, nevertheless we should remain in contact,  Merkel told a news conference.  I think all parties  have a responsibility to ensure that there will be a stable government.  Merkel made clear she still intended to serve a full four years as chancellor. But her next coalition could be her toughest yet with her only remaining potential partners, the business-friendly FDP and the pro-regulation Greens, at odds on issues from migrants to tax, the environment and Europe. The FDP s leader Christian Lindner set the stage for tricky talks, saying his party would not agree to a coalition with the conservatives and the Greens, dubbed  Jamaica  because the parties  colors mirror the country s flag, at any price. He said changes were needed in Germany s energy policy and its stance on euro zone fiscal policy. But he struck a more conciliatory tone on Europe, saying Germany had an interest in a strong France. [B4N1JX00B]  The Greens set out climate change, Europe and social justice as their priorities in any coalition talks. The emergence of the Greens as powerbrokers in any coalition weighed on markets. Shares in carmaker BMW (BMWG.DE) were down 0.2 percent, while those in automotive supplier Continental (CONG.DE) dropped 0.4 percent. RWE (RWEG.DE)   which operates 15.25 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired plants in Germany, 38 percent of its total European capacity   fell 4.6 percent to a six-week low. The party campaigned to ban the sale of new combustion-engine cars from 2030 and are calling for a quick phase-out of coal power plants. Many Germans were alarmed by the rise of AfD who the foreign minister likened to Nazis. Protesters threw stones and bottles at police outside its campaign party in Berlin on Sunday. But just a day after the election, the AfD showed signs of fracturing as co-leader Frauke Petry, one of its most prominent faces, said she would not sit in parliament with AfD members. It was not immediately clear why she was making such a move. The election also exposed rifts in Merkel s conservatives, with her allies the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), who face a regional election next year, demanding a shift to the right to win back voters lost to the AfD.  They will try their best to recover lost ground on the right side of the political spectrum. Going into a coalition in Berlin with the Greens and the FDP will make this more difficult,  said Janis Emmanouilidis from the European Policy Centre. Investors were unsettled by the prospect of a weaker Merkel at the head of a potentially unstable  Jamaica  coalition and also worried that months of coalition talks could distract from talks with Britain over its divorce from the European Union. The euro EUR=D4 and European stocks slipped, while concerns about the emergence of a more hardline stance toward the euro zone in the bloc's largest economy weighed on Southern European government bonds.   The weak result could make Angela Merkel a lame duck much faster than international observers and financial markets think,  ING economist Carsten Brzeski said. Klaus Wohlrabe, economist at the Munich-based Ifo economic institute, said new elections could not be excluded and the result could stoke uncertainty as German business confidence deteriorated unexpectedly in the weeks before the election. German business also expressed concern. Matthias Mueller, chief executive of Volkswagen, said he was  shocked  by the AfD s double-digit showing and said the success of Europe s largest economy hinged on its tolerance and openness to the world.  For Germany s biggest industrial company I say: In the globalized economy, national egoism and protectionism lead to a dead - and in the end a loss of jobs.  ",

        "title": "Germany balks at Tillerson call for more European NATO spending",
        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reassured his nervous European counterparts over Washington\u2019s commitment to NATO on Friday and pressed them again to spend more on defense, triggering a rebuke from Germany. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said it was neither \u201creachable nor desirable\u201d for Germany to spend the agreed NATO target of two percent of member states\u2019 economic output on defense. NATO allies have until 2024 to do that. \u201cTwo percent would mean military expenses of some 70 billion euros. I don\u2019t know any German politician who would claim that is reachable nor desirable,\u201d Gabriel told the first meeting of NATO foreign ministers attended by Tillerson.  \u201cThe United States will realize it is better to talk about better spending instead of more spending,\u201d he said, noting that humanitarian, development and economic aid to stabilize countries and regions should also count.   In his first remarks to NATO ministers, Tillerson said allies needed to pay up or outline plans for meeting that target when NATO leaders meet on May 25 for the first top-level summit of the alliance to be attended by U.S. President Donald Trump.  Trump has criticized NATO as \u201cobsolete\u201d and suggested Washington\u2019s security guarantees for European allies could be conditional on them spending more on their own defense. He has also said he wants NATO to do more to fight terrorism.  \u201cOur goal should be to agree at the May leaders meeting that by the end of the year all allies will have either met the pledge guidelines or will have developed plans that clearly articulate how...the pledge will be fulfilled,\u201d Tillerson said.  \u201cAllies must demonstrate by their actions that they share U.S. government\u2019s commitment.\u201d In Berlin, German government spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said the government was committed to increasing defense spending and would continue to do so \u201cbecause we know it is necessary and makes sense to further strengthen our armed forces\u201d. U.S. defense expenditure makes up about 70 percent of the total NATO allies\u2019 defense spending. Only four European NATO members - Estonia, Greece, Poland and Britain - meet the two-percent target. NATO head Jens Stoltenberg rejected Gabriel\u2019s call to include non-military spending toward the goal, but said Germany was moving \u201cin the right direction\u201d with more military spending after years of cuts. He said NATO ministers on Friday discussed national plans for arriving at the target as they prepared for the May summit.  In London, Britain\u2019s Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said that other European NATO allies must \u201craise their game, and those failing to meet the two-percent commitment... should at least agree to year-on-year real terms increases.\u201d Tillerson did, however, offer assurances of Washington\u2019s commitment to NATO during his brief stop in Brussels, where he did not hold one-on-one meetings with countries, which is customary during such gatherings.  His initial decision to skip his first meeting with NATO foreign ministers had added to questions about the Trump administration\u2019s commitment. The meeting was later rescheduled and he attended on Friday. \u201cThe United States is committed to ensuring NATO has the capabilities to support our collective defense,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cWe will uphold the agreements we have made to defend our allies.\u201d Tillerson said NATO was fundamental to countering Russian aggression in Ukraine and said the United States would hold Moscow accountable to its commitments under a two-year Minsk ceasefire deal. He pledged to keep sanctions in place against Moscow until it complies with the Minsk agreement. Trump has said in the past that, as part of a rapprochement he is seeking with Russia, he is prepared to review the sanctions, which were imposed  by Barack Obama over Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea Peninsula. \u201cWe do not, and will not, accept Russian efforts to change the borders of territory of Ukraine,\u201d Tillerson said according to a transcript of his remarks. \u201cThe United States sanctions will remain until Moscow reverses the actions that triggered our sanctions,\u201d he added, expressing alarm at a surge in violence along the front lines in eastern Ukraine. Stoltenberg said ties between European NATO members and the United States were \u201crock solid\u201d.  He said \u201cfair burden sharing to keep the trans-atlantic bond strong\u201d and \u201cstepping up NATO efforts to project stability and fight terrorism\u201d were on the agenda on Friday as the bloc seeks to respond to the new, harsher tone from across the Atlantic.

        "title": "Banks view turning branches to subsidiaries as Brexit 'red line'",
        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign banks in Britain view any attempt to make them convert their branches to subsidiaries after Brexit as a  red line  which would likely cause them to rethink their presence in the country, an industry report said on Wednesday.      Deputy Governor of the Bank of England Sam Woods said earlier this year that branches of European Union banks in London might have to apply to become subsidiaries after Britain leaves, a costly exercise that involves building up capital and reserves locally.   Several European banks base the bulk of their investment banking activities, such as sales and trading, in London, operating via a branch structure that relies on capital held by their parent and are mainly supervised by their home regulator.  A requirement to subsidiarize was a clear  red line  for most branches, with both EU and non- EU branches confirming that a subsidiarization approach would cause them to reassess their presence in the UK, possibly leading to the closure of the UK branch,  the report by the Association of Foreign Banks (AFB) and law firm Norton Rose Fulbright found after surveying senior executives from global banks. Woods has said that he will have to decide by Christmas if branches of EU financial firms in London must convert to subsidiaries and be directly supervised by the (Prudential Regulation Authority) PRA. British regulators have been comfortable with this situation with Britain as part of the EU, but once Britain leaves they will want these banks to have enough capital to support their business and ensure that British taxpayers are not left footing the bill in a crisis. The focus so far has been on banks based in Britain applying for licenses to operate on the continent once Britain leaves the EU.  Deutsche Bank has 9,000 staff based in Britain, while BNP Paribas has around 6,500 staff in the country, where it bases the bulk of its investment banking business and Societe Generale has some 4,000 staff in Britain.  A significant majority of EU branch respondents said that enforced subsidiarization would cause them to reconsider their presence in the UK, with the two most likely outcomes being reallocation of regulated activity into the EU, or closure of London branches and withdrawal from the UK altogether,  the report added.  A report from Boston Consulting has estimated the switch to a full subsidiary structure could cost European banks around 40 billion euros ($47 billion) in extra capital Some respondents said that one solution would be to allow branches to continue operating where the parent entity is in a similarly regulated market and only insist on subsidiary status if there was UK deposit taking activity.

        "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s travel restrictions on people with passports from seven countries and a freeze on refugee resettlement was \u201cnot the best way to protect the U.S.\u201d and should be lifted sooner than later.  Guterres\u2019 comments were his first to directly address Trump\u2019s signing of an executive order last Friday on immigration amid a drumbeat of criticism from around the world and protests. The order put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely and imposed a 90-day suspension on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The White House has described the order as necessary \u201cto protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States.\u201d But Guterres told reporters on Wednesday that \u201cthis is not the way to best protect the U.S. or any other country in relation to the serious concerns that exist about possible terrorist infiltration. \u201cI think that these measures should be removed sooner rather than later,\u201d said Guterres, who has issued a series of comments since Friday about the importance of protecting refugees and the dangers of broad-based travel bans. Guterres said travel bans risked playing to the advantage of terrorist organizations seeking to recruit members.  \u201cIf a global terrorist organization will try to attack any country like the United States, they will probably not come with people with passports from those countries that are hot spots of conflict today,\u201d he said.   He said such groups were likely to use people for attacks traveling on the passports of \u201cdeveloped and credible countries,\u201d or who had been living in the United States or other countries for decades. A panel of U.N. human rights experts urged the Trump administration on Wednesday to protect people fleeing war and persecution, and said the executive order contravened international humanitarian and human rights laws. Critics of the order inside the United States have described it as unconstitutional and several states have sued to challenge the travel ban.  ",

        "title": "U.S. Senate backs Montenegro's membership in NATO",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday overwhelmingly backed the expansion of NATO to allow Montenegro to join the alliance, hoping to send a message that the United States will push back against Russian efforts to increase its influence in Europe. The long-delayed vote was 97-2 in favor of Montenegro\u2019s accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. That was well above the two-thirds majority needed in the 100-member Senate to ratify Montenegro\u2019s membership. There was no immediate confirmation of whether President Donald Trump would formally deposit the instrument of ratification, the last step in the U.S. ratification process. However, his administration had supported NATO membership for the tiny Balkan nation, one of Europe\u2019s smallest, despite Trump at times criticizing the alliance as he campaigned for president last year. While campaigning, Trump accused other NATO members of  failing to pay their fair share while adopting a conciliatory tone toward Russia. But as president, Trump has pledged his support for the alliance. Reuters reported last week that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson wrote to the leaders of the Senate this month to say Montenegro\u2019s membership in NATO was \u201cstrongly in the interests of the United States.\u201d On Tuesday, the only two \u201cno\u201d votes came from Republican Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee, who had delayed the vote for months by refusing to allow a quick vote. Senate leaders held the more time-consuming roll call vote this week after receiving Tillerson\u2019s letter. Paul had questioned the wisdom of allowing a country with just 650,000 residents and an army of just 2,000 to join the alliance, saying American taxpayers should not be forced to pay if Montenegro were attacked. Russia opposes NATO\u2019s enlargement in the western Balkans. Backers said it was important to support countries like Montenegro to promote western values and push back against Moscow, which Montenegrin officials said was partly behind an alleged plot to overthrow their government during an election in October 2016. Moscow dismissed that accusation. \u201cWith a nearly unanimous vote, the Senate has sent a clear message that it stands firmly with Montenegro and against the Kremlin\u2019s bullying,\u201d said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. All 28 NATO members must ratify Montenegro\u2019s accession in order for the country to join the alliance. Washington is among  the last to do so.

The Republican president-elect takes office on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s very much formulated down to the final strokes. We haven\u2019t put it in quite yet but we\u2019re going to be doing it soon,\u201d Trump told the Post, adding he was waiting for his nominee for health and human services secretary, Tom Price, to be confirmed. The plan, he said, would include \u201clower numbers, much lower deductibles,\u201d without elaborating. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have insurance for everybody,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere was a philosophy in some circles that if you can\u2019t pay for it, you don\u2019t get it. That\u2019s not going to happen with us.\u201d Trump was also quoted as saying in the interview that he would target pharmaceutical companies over drug pricing and insist they negotiate directly with the Medicare and Medicaid government health plans for the elderly and poor. U.S. House Republicans won passage on Friday of a measure starting the process of dismantling the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, despite concerns about not having a ready replacement and the potential financial cost of repealing the law. With the vote, Republicans began delivering on their promise to end Obamacare, also a campaign pledge of Trump, who has called the program a \u201cdisaster.\u201d The law, which expanded health coverage to some 20 million people, has been plagued by increases in insurance premiums and deductibles and by some large insurers leaving the system. Republicans have called Obamacare federal government overreach and have sought to undermine it in Congress and the courts since it was passed by Democratic majorities in the House and Senate in 2010. Democrats say Obamacare has allowed growing numbers of Americans to get medical insurance and helped slow the rise in healthcare spending. ",

        "title": "SEC's foreign corruption unit chief to leave by month's end",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kara Novaco Brockmeyer, the attorney at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission who oversees the unit that polices foreign bribery laws, plans to depart the SEC later this month, the regulator announced Tuesday. Brockmeyer, a 17-year veteran of the SEC, has led the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) unit since 2011.  The unit was one of five specialty areas created in 2010 in an effort to bolster the SEC\u2019s enforcement program following revelations over the agency\u2019s repeated failures to detect Bernard Madoff\u2019s massive Ponzi scheme. Brockmeyer oversaw a wide array of FCPA cases, including charges against hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC and its chief executive Daniel Och over bribery in Africa, charges against JPMorgan Chase & Co following the so-called \u201cprinceling\u201d investigation into hiring practices in China in order to win business and charges against Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer SA over bribes paid in a variety of countries. The SEC said that after Brockmeyer departs, the unit\u2019s current deputy chief Charles Cain will serve as acting chief until a permanent replacement is named. The SEC\u2019s enforcement of the FCPA is an area that is being actively watched by the defense bar, after President Donald Trump previously made disparaging remarks about the law and called for it to be changed. Trump\u2019s pick to lead the SEC, Wall Street attorney Jay Clayton, also previously chaired a committee at the New York City Bar Association which drafted a paper that was somewhat critical of how the law was being enforced. Clayton, whose nomination was approved by the Senate Banking Committee earlier on Tuesday, is still awaiting confirmation by the full Senate. Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee have previously raised concerns about whether he will actively pursue FCPA cases. In written responses to questions from the panel\u2019s top Democrat Sherrod Brown following his confirmation hearing, Clayton said he believes the law can be a \u201cpowerful and effective means\u201d to combating corruption.  He added, however, that it is more effective when international authorities are also willing to coordinate and take enforcement actions against bribery, as opposed to having the United States go at it alone.

        "title": "U.S. lawmakers want health agencies to lower prostate cancer drug cost",
        "text": "(Reuters) - A group of lawmakers is calling on the National Institutes of Health and Department of Health and Human Services to step in and reduce the cost of Medivation Inc\u2019s and Astellas Pharma Inc\u2019s prostate cancer drug Xtandi. In the letter signed by Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Reps. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) and Peter Welch (D-Vt.), the lawmakers urged NIH to hold a public hearing to consider overriding the patent on Xtandi to make the drug available at a lower price. The medication has an average wholesale price in the United States of more than $129,000 but is sold in Japan and Sweden for $39,000 and in Canada for $30,000, according to the lawmakers\u2019 letter, addressed to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell and NIH Director Francis Collins. They noted federal funds supported development of the drug, which was based on research at the University of California, Los Angeles, conducted with taxpayer-supported grants.  \u201cWhen Americans pay for research that results in a pharmaceutical, that drug should be available at a reasonable price,\u201d said Doggett, co-chair of the House Democratic Caucus Prescription Drug Task Force. \u201cAn unaffordable drug is 100 percent ineffective.\u201d A spokesman for Astellas said 81 percent of privately insured patients paid $25 or less out of pocket per month for the medication in 2015 and 79 percent of Medicare patients paid nothing out of pocket. For eligible patients who do not have insurance or are underinsured and have an annual adjusted household income of $100,000 or less, Astellas provides Xtandi for free, spokesman Tyler Marciniak said.  Of the 20,000 men treated with Xtandi last year, more than 2,000 received the drug for free, he added. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in America, affecting about one in seven men, according to the American Cancer Society. U.S. lawmakers and presidential candidates have in recent months stepped up criticism of U.S. drug price trends, raising investor concerns that future price cuts could hurt pharmaceutical and biotech companies.  \u201cThe United States government should use every tool available to lower outrageously high prescription drug prices,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cNIH has the power to stop this blatant profiteering and put the pharmaceutical industry on notice that the era of charging unconscionable prices must end.\u201d Medivation could not be reached for comment. Spokesmen for the NIH and HHS could not be reached. Also signing the letter were Sens. Al Franken (D-Minn.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as well as Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.).   ",

        "title": "Attacking Trump, Democrat Kaine makes campaign-trail debut",
        "text": "MIAMI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Tim Kaine made his first appearance on the campaign trail as Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate on Saturday, touting an optimistic view of America and leaping to attack Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s record. Joining Clinton at a rally in the battleground state of Florida, the bilingual Kaine peppered Spanish-language phrases into a speech focused on introducing himself to voters unfamiliar with the low-key U.S. senator from Virginia. Kaine criticized Trump\u2019s recent suggestion he might not honor U.S. security commitments to NATO in Europe, and the real estate mogul\u2019s history of casino bankruptcies and founding the failed Trump University. \u201cWhen Donald Trump says he has your back, you better watch out,\u201d Kaine said, with Clinton sitting at his side nodding. \u201cHe leaves a trail of broken promises and wrecked lives wherever he goes. We can\u2019t afford to let him do the same thing to our country.\u201d In contrast, he said, Clinton \u201cdoesn\u2019t insult people, she listens to them. What a novel concept.\u201d He said they shared a common creed: \u201cDo all the good you can.\u201d Clinton unveiled her choice of Kaine late on Friday, grabbing the political spotlight from Trump, who accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday night after a chaotic four-day convention. The former secretary of state will formally be nominated as her party\u2019s presidential candidate in the Nov. 8 election at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, which opens on Monday. In choosing the soft-spoken Kaine, a former Richmond mayor and Virginia governor with a long establishment resume, Clinton opted for a steady and experienced hand who she hopes will offer a clear alternative to Trump\u2019s volatile campaign and his Republican vice presidential choice Mike Pence. \u201cSenator Tim Kaine is everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not. He is qualified to step into this job and lead on day one,\u201d Clinton told the Miami crowd. Trump was unimpressed, saying on Twitter he had watched the joint appearance and \u201cISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don\u2019t look presidential to me!\u201d In his speech, Kaine said he was an optimist and described his childhood in Kansas City helping his father in his metal-working shop and his Catholic mission to Honduras, where he helped teenagers with carpentry and welding and they taught him Spanish. He said in Honduras he learned the values \u201cFe, familia, y trabajo\u201d \u2014 faith, family, and work. Kaine became emotional when he recalled the 2007 shooting deaths of 32 people at Virginia Tech University during his stint as governor, calling it the worst day of his life. He promised to take on the National Rifle Association and fight for \u201ccommon sense\u201d gun control. Judith Sweeney, 58, from West Park, Florida, said she knew little about Kaine before attending the speech but was impressed by his resume and liked his civil rights work and school reform efforts. \u201cWonderful, very experienced, an innovator,\u201d she said. Peter Daou, a former adviser to Clinton who now owns a media company, said Kaine\u2019s speech would turn around some of the doubters about the choice. \u201cThe combination of his tone, his demeanor, his life story -it just said a lot about her capacity to choose the right person and not listen to pressure from the outside,\u201d he said. Clinton is hoping Kaine will help her appeal to independents and moderates, but some supporters of Clinton\u2019s Democratic primary rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, were dismayed by the choice because of Kaine\u2019s past advocacy for an Asian free-trade pact. But in a nod to party liberals, the Clinton campaign said Kaine will not support the final version of the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership, which is pending in the Senate. A spokeswoman for Kaine confirmed his opposition to the pact. The decision drew cheers from liberal groups and labor leaders. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to see the Clinton-Kaine ticket taking steps to campaign on big, bold, populist ideas that voters want to hear from Democrats,\u201d said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progessive Change Campaign Committee. Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, said Kaine\u2019s decision to join Clinton in opposing the trade pact \u201csets an irretrievable, progressive path forward for America.\u201d In picking Kaine, Clinton passed over liberal candidates who would have generated more grassroots enthusiasm like U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Hispanic Cabinet members Julian Castro and Thomas Perez. Clinton tried to reassure party liberals, offering an extended list of Kaine\u2019s efforts on behalf of low-income workers, education and civil rights, and for expanded gun control laws and immigration reform. \u201cHe fights for the people he represents, and he delivers real results,\u201d Clinton said, applying one of her favorite self-descriptions to him. \u201cWhen I say he\u2019s a progressive who likes to get things done, I mean it.\u201d Sanders supporters lost their bid to eliminate or reduce the influence of superdelegates, party leaders who are not bound to any candidate, during a meeting of the convention rules committee in Philadelphia. Sanders had complained about the superdelegates, which overwhelmingly backed Clinton. But enough committee members backed the effort to let them take the fight to the convention floor during next week\u2019s convention, participants said.   ",

        "title": "Many 'lost' voters say they have found their candidate in Trump",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ted Wade hasn\u2019t cared about politics enough to cast a vote in a U.S. presidential election for almost a quarter of a century, back when he supported Ross Perot\u2019s independent candidacy in 1992. But Republican Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 White House bid has motivated Wade to get involved and he plans to support the real estate mogul in Nevada\u2019s nominating caucus next month. Trump is a \u201cnon-politician\u201d who can fix the \u201cchaos\u201d in Washington, he says. About one in 10 Americans who plan to cast a vote this election will do so for the first time in years, if ever, and Trump holds a decided edge with them, according to polling by Reuters/Ipsos. (tmsnrt.rs/1SgeLvi) These voters offer Trump a pool of voters who could be decisive either in the Republican primaries or a general election. They could be crucial for Trump in early-voting states such as Iowa and South Carolina, where his nearest rival, Senator Ted Cruz, is putting pressure on Trump and enjoys a strong base of support with more traditionally conservative voters. In Reuters/Ipsos polling from June to December 2015, 27.3 percent of these \u201cnew\u201d voters said they would vote for Trump, higher than his poll numbers among independents and Republicans who regularly vote. By way of comparison, Cruz captures just 3.4 percent of these voters. And Senator Marco Rubio of Florida snags only 4 percent. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the chaos between Democrats and Republicans and want to give somebody a try who I think can make a difference,\u201d said Wade of Trump. The 51-year-old has already switched his affiliation from Democrat to Republican and even attended a Trump campaign event in Las Vegas. He has told his three older children to get involved in the elections, although he did not say whether he wanted them to vote for Trump.  Trump, the Republican front-runner, has made targeting \u201clost\u201d voters such as Wade a focus of his campaign. His anti-immigrant rhetoric and protectionist trade proposals have helped him to fashion a message tailored to reach Americans alienated by the endless enmity between the political parties and who, because of declining economic prospects, may feel like neither party has done much for them. Trump\u2019s strategy is a gamble, given the lack of reliability of many of the voters with whom he is most popular. In interviews, some of those lost voters insist they will show up, saying they are drawn to Trump\u2019s outsider status and his willingness to upend the political system. Tucson, Arizona, resident Renay Cunningham, 56, said she had never paid much attention to politics in the past. She plans to cast her first ever vote for Trump after hearing his proposed policies to curb illegal immigration, which include building a giant wall on the southern border and making Mexico pay for it. \u201cWe need a piranha in there, and he\u2019s definitely a piranha,\u201d she said. Trump and his operatives are confident they can do what few of his rivals for the Republican nomination have shown they can do \u2014 expand the party\u2019s potential voter pool. But while Democrat Barack Obama did that eight years ago by largely registering new voters, including record levels of minorities, both male and female, in urban centers, Trump\u2019s campaign has instead largely sought out the disaffected, who tend to be overwhelmingly older, white, and less educated than the broader electorate. \u201cMy whole campaign has been focused on expanding the number of people who want to, and will, participate in this election cycle,\u201d Trump wrote in a recent op-ed in USA Today. When analyzing \u201clost\u201d or \u201cnew\u201d voters, Reuters compiled poll results from people who haven\u2019t voted in the previous two presidential campaigns and midterm congressional elections. The results focused only on those who said they were nearly certain to vote in the November election. It included responses from 3,440 \u201cnew\u201d Republican and independent voters \u2013 a sample that has a credibility interval of 2 percentage points. Jan Leighley, an expert on turnout at American University, said it\u2019s too soon to compare Trump\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d voters with the disenfranchised voters, especially minorities, who in 2008 turned out in record numbers to elect the first black president. Those voters didn\u2019t find their way to the polls simply because they were inspired to make history, Leighley said. \u201cHe also had a kick-ass mobilization structure.\u201d \u201cObama\u2019s campaign went door-to-door. They canvassed whole neighborhoods. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he (Trump) has the campaign infrastructure to make sure that the folks who are riled up are walked to the polls on Election Day,\u201d she said. Trump\u2019s campaign insists he does have the infrastructure, but won\u2019t provide specifics on how it intends to turn casual supporters into engaged voters. The campaign says it does follow up with the thousands of attendees who jam arenas for Trump\u2019s rallies. That\u2019s one significant advantage the reality star has over the other candidates in the Republican field, as the challenge in reaching voters who have fallen out of the political process often lies in simply locating them. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified a lot of people in early primary states who have not participated in the process before,\u201d campaign manager Corey Lewandowski told Reuters. Lewandowski resists the notion that Trump needs to turn out \u201cnew\u201d or reluctant voters to win states such as Iowa. Even if the Trump campaign isn\u2019t necessarily counting on them, it may be reassuring that his supporters among \u201cnew\u201d voters who responded to the Reuters/Ipsos survey appear motivated to cast a vote for him. At least for the time being. Ronald Thomas, a 49-year-old truck driver and Navy veteran in North Carolina, said he, too, has never voted in a presidential contest. His girlfriend would push him to vote but he would always say \u201cYeah, but the right one ain\u2019t come along yet,\u2019\u201d Thomas said. Trump is that man. His willingness to take on the government has set him apart as someone who would \u201cactually look out for the people,\u201d said Thomas. Now he wants to know how to register so that he can vote for the billionaire.  And there\u2019s Vince DiSylvester, a retired maintenance worker in Missouri, who, at 73, said has never cast a ballot for president. But Trump has inspired him to rethink that. \u201cHe\u2019s a businessman, he knows business, he knows how to get things done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he tells it like it is. If you don\u2019t like it - well, too bad.\u201d  (Editing by Ross Colvin) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate on Monday moved closer to confirming Dr. Robert Califf to lead the Food and Drug Administration, overriding opposition from several senators who had sought to block a vote on the issue. In a procedural move designed to prevent the opponents from blocking the confirmation indefinitely, the Senate voted 80 to 6 in favor of limiting further debate on the matter to no more than 30 hours, meaning a confirmation vote could take place as early as Tuesday. Democrats Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Joe Manchin of West Virginia among others had sought to block the confirmation vote citing disagreements with the FDA\u2019s process for approving opioid painkillers.  Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders also placed a hold on the nomination, saying he objected to Califf\u2019s close ties to the pharmaceutical industry. Under pressure, the FDA recently agreed to a number of changes to its opioid approval process, and said it would convene an advisory panel meeting before approving new opioid painkillers that do not include an abuse-deterrent feature. The opponents said the measures do not go far enough and that advisory panels should be called before any opioid is approved.  \u201cThe FDA has to be the cop on the beat,\u201d Markey said.

        "title": "Illinois governor undeterred by court ruling in union dues fight",
        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner vowed to pursue a legal challenge against union dues the state collects from non-unionized, rank-and-file government workers despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday that upheld the practice. In a victory for labor, a 4-4 deadlock by the nation\u2019s high court allowed a federal appeals court opinion to stand against 10 non-unionized California public school teachers who contended so-called fair-share dues should not be withheld from their paychecks if they chose against union membership. But the court move likely does not settle the issue, because nearly identical federal litigation in Illinois that Rauner helped launch last year remains viable. \u201cOur case is winding its way through the courts, and it will get to the Supreme Court probably at some point in the future,\u201d Rauner said during a stop in rural Illinois on Tuesday. \u201cAnd we will just continue the fight for the freedom of political expression and the right of free speech for government employees. It\u2019s a fundamental issue.\u201d Since taking office in 2015, the first-term Republican governor has waged war with public-sector unions in a bid to weaken their longstanding influence over state politics. During his first month in office, the governor signed an executive order to bar state agencies from withholding fair-share dues, which non-unionized employees must pay under Illinois law and collective-bargaining agreements to support non-political union activities that benefit all workers. Public-sector unions sued in Illinois state court to block Rauner\u2019s executive order from being implemented and persuaded a judge to allow the fees to continue to be collected while the case, which is still pending, was litigated. Simultaneously, Rauner sued in federal court to challenge the fees, but last May he was dismissed from the case by a judge, who ruled the governor lacked legal standing. Three non-unionized Illinois workers forced to pay between $19.75 and $60.86 in union dues per paycheck were allowed to proceed with their own complaint. A spokesman for the union representing the largest bloc of state workers called Tuesday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling a \u201cwin\u201d but acknowledged the Illinois case may become the next fair-share battlefront. \u201cThese attacks are political, and they\u2019re ideological. They\u2019re brought by people who want to rig the economy and our democracy in their favor. They\u2019re not going to stop because they lost this particular challenge. They\u2019ll bring another one,\u201d said Anders Lindall, a spokesman for AFSCME Council 31. ",

        "title": "Problems pile up for unlucky village near epicenter of Mexican quake",
        "text": "HUAUTLA, Mexico (Reuters) - Yesenia Vergara grabbed her two daughters and abandoned her home in the isolated Mexican hamlet of Huautla late last month when rain-swollen river waters burst through her window, flooding her house with branches, boulders and mud. Just two weeks later, Mexico s deadliest earthquake in a generation delivered a second blow to her simple riverside home, financed with money sent back by her husband from the United States.  This is the end of the world, I thought. Now is the time that God has called us to be judged,  Vergara said, recalling the moment when the quake struck in the early afternoon last Tuesday.  The village was just getting back on its feet and now another tragedy has come,  she said. The epicenter of the 7.1 magnitude tremor, which has claimed nearly 300 lives so far, leveled dozens of buildings in Mexico City, sparking a desperate search for survivors. The quake struck 70 km (45 miles) from Huautla, a charming settlement nestled amid the lime-green mountains of Morelos state.     While the Mexican capital has been over-run with eager volunteers amid an outpouring of support, the villages of Morelos and Puebla states that lie near the epicenter have received much less attention.     A growing cadre of well-wishers sought to rectify that on Friday, fanning out across the states  backroads, trudging through knee-high streams to deliver food, water and medicine to remote populations high up in the mountains.     Far outpacing the government response, the volunteers  patriotic reaction has cheered a traumatized country. It has also provided a sharp contrast to the increasingly politicized reaction to the tremor, which sparked a virtual arms race between political parties seeking to outdo each other with donations to relief efforts.      We feel very grateful,  Vergara said of the volunteers.  But also very disappointed with the government.  Although the quake didn t destroy any buildings in Huautla, Mayor Miguel Medina said 10 families out of roughly 1,000 people were evacuated because some 100 structures were damaged.     By Friday afternoon, Vergara said nobody had yet come to inspect the thick cracks menacing her home, exiling her and her young family to her mother s house.     Fortino Garcia, a 48-year-old taxi driver from the city of Cuernavaca, was among eight people who had driven from Mexico City to deliver aid to villages in the area.     Although he approved of the government s reaction to the quake, he criticized politicians who he said were trying to capitalize on the tragedy by placing stickers with their name or party on supplies collected by volunteers.      Lots of politicians are sadly jumping on this to campaign,  he said in Huautla s main square, after delivering diapers, sanitary towels and water.     A growing resentment over how the aid was being distributed by village officials was on display as residents accused officials of cherry-picking better quality donations of clothes and food and leaving less desirable ones for the villagers.     In a warehouse in the center of the village where hundreds of women were lining up for food and water, Medina denied he or any of his employees had been profiting from the aid, which he said came from all over the world.      People from other countries have come to give us their little grain of sand,  he said.  We re very surprised and thankful.      Still, rumors of official malfeasance could be found on every corner.     Like much of Mexico, crime and violence in Huautla had risen dramatically over the last few years, according to a shopkeeper who declined to give her name out of fear. She said some villagers took up arms last month and installed themselves at the entrance to the town to ward off outsiders.     In July, she said, an elderly woman was killed when she interrupted a burglary in her home, something previously unheard of in this quiet farming settlement.      Given the impact of the flood, the quake and rising violence, she said she was less optimistic for the future of her teenage daughter, who was listening by her side.      We re scared,  the shopkeeper said.  Things aren t like they used to be.  ",

        "title": "Merkel urges compromises as coalition talks enter final stretch",
        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday urged party leaders negotiating a tricky three-way coalition government to show more willingness to compromise, as support for her conservative bloc plunged to the lowest level in more than six years. Merkel s conservatives, who bled support to the far-right Alternative for Germany in a Sept. 24 election, are trying to forge an alliance with the pro-market Free Democrats (FDP) and the left-leaning Greens which is untested at the national level. Despite three weeks of exploratory talks, the unlikely partners still have to overcome differences over climate protection, energy, transport, immigration and euro zone policy. Speaking ahead of a meeting in which party leaders were expected to sum up progress made so far and bridge some gaps, Merkel said all parties had first exchanged their views and then consolidated the approaches by highlighting their differences.  Now in this third phase, the task is to find compromises,  Merkel said, adding that there was still a lot of work to do.  But from my point of view, a solution can be reached with goodwill,  Merkel said.  If this will be achieved, we ll not know before the end of the week, however.  FDP leader Christian Lindner put the onus on Merkel s  Christian Democrats (CDU) and her Bavarian CSU allies, saying his party and the Greens had already given ground.  The Greens and the FDP have moved. Now it s up to the conservatives to show some flexibility. I assume there is goodwill from all sides,  Lindner said. Katrin Goering-Eckardt from the Greens said she wanted to see a leap from the other negotiation partners. But CSU leader Horst Seehofer declined to comment when asked by reporters what compromises he was willing to offer. The Greens made concessions on Tuesday by no longer insisting on fixed dates to ban cars with combustion engines and to shut down coal-fired power stations. The FDP gave ground by accepting more modest income tax cuts than an election campaign pledge of up to 40 billion euros in relief. Lindner also dropped an election manifesto pledge to phase out the ESM euro zone bailout fund. Merkel wants to have an agreement in principle by Nov. 16 on moving ahead to formal coalition negotiations to form a black-yellow-green government   dubbed a  Jamaica coalition  because the parties  colours match those of that country s flag. With less than a week to go, the exploratory coalition talks are not only complicated by the differences between the parties, but also by splits within the political parties themselves   especially within the conservatives and Greens. A breakdown of the talks could mean fresh elections in Germany,  Europe s biggest economy, since the Social Democrats (SPD)   the second biggest party   have made clear they have no appetite for joining another  grand coalition  under Merkel. A survey by Emnid for Bild am Sonntag newspaper showed only 30 percent would vote for Merkel s CDU/CSU bloc if there were a federal election this Sunday, down 1 percentage point. This is the lowest reading for the conservatives in this survey since October 2011 and marks a slump in support since the Sept. 24 election, in which Merkel s bloc won 32.9 percent. Touching on one of the thorniest issues, Merkel said on Saturday that Germany should lead the fight against climate change and cut emissions without destroying industrial jobs. Merkel s comments, made in her weekly podcast and in the middle of talks on limiting global warming attended by about 200 nations in the western German city of Bonn, highlighted the dilemma facing the centre-right leader in the negotiations. While the CDU/CSU and the FDP want to spare companies from additional burdens, the Greens want to spell out which measures the next government will implement for Germany to reach its 2020 goal of lowering emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels. Due to strong economic growth and higher-than-expected immigration, Germany is at risk of missing its emissions target without any additional measures.  ",

        "title": "Kenyan President Kenyatta wins 98 percent of vote in repeat election",
        "text": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta won 98 percent of the vote in a repeated election in which an opposition boycott helped lower turnout to 39 percent, the electoral commission said on Monday. The announcement touched off small protests in a few opposition strongholds but also celebrations in pro-Kenyatta areas. Veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga said the Oct. 26 election was a farce. Civil society groups also cited problems with the vote. The violence has for the most part seen protesters clash with police but some Kenyans fear it is starting to take on ethnic overtones after two deaths in clashes between rival groups at the weekend. At least 66 people have died in overall election violence. On Monday, the U.S. ambassador said Washington was  profoundly concerned  by the outbreaks of violence since the re-run. Kenya is east Africa s richest economy and a key security ally of the West against militant Islam. It also a key regional trade, logistics and trade hub. In his victory speech, Kenyatta repeated his belief that his victory in the original Aug. 8 election was legitimate and said dialogue would have to wait if the opposition was going to lodge court cases again. The Supreme Court nullified the Aug. 8 vote on procedural grounds.  My victory today is just part of a process that is likely to once again be subjected to a constitutional test through our courts ... I will submit to this constitutional path regardless of the outcome,  Kenyatta said.   Those who are going to ask me:  Are you going to engage in dialogue?  ... Let them (the opposition) first and foremost exhaust all their constitutional options.   Kenyatta took 98 percent of the vote, results from 266 out of 291 constituencies showed. The electoral commission said 7,616,217 valid votes were cast, representing 39 percent of the 19.6 million registered voters.  Protests by Odinga s supporters prevented polling stations from opening in 25 constituencies.  The election commission said poor security prevented voting in those areas but the final announcement could go ahead as it would not  materially affect  the result.  In the pro-Kenyatta area of Dagoretti North in Nairobi, cars honked and crowds of supporters in red T-shirts ran through the streets.   I m so happy the president has got his seat back,  said Peterson Njau.  Now the economy is going to lift up again.   Another resident, Kennedy Okeyo, said he cared more about football than politics but that ethnic clashes in his home this weekend had unnerved him.   You can t get to work, and even if you get to work, you can get attacked because of who you are,  he said.  But just down the road in Nairobi s Kawangware slum, around 100 youths listening to the results on mobile phones chanted  No Raila No Peace . They lit a bonfire in the middle of the street and began taunting riot police with cries of  the people want teargas .  Earlier, police dispersed protesters there with teargas when they tried to block a visit by Interior Minister Fred Matiang i. Another Nairobi shanty town, Mathare, the scene of deadly clashes between police and protesters immediately after the August vote, was largely calm although a handful of protesters lit a small fire.  And in the western city of Kisumu, Odinga s political heartland, around 50 youths began to block the road at the Kondele roundabout, the epicenter of protests, while others banged metal poles together. But the protest was small.   What can I do? They ve already announced it. Even if I burn tires, nothing will change,  said 25-year-old laborer Kennedy Omondi as he watched young men set a barricade alight.  Odinga pulled out of last week s vote, saying the electoral commission had failed to institute reforms to forestall the kind of  illegalities and irregularities  that scuppered Kenyatta s victory in the August election.  Kura Yangu Sauti Yangu, a coalition of civil society organizations with 2,000 election observers, said there were  multiple  cases where results from polling stations differed from results on the forms posted on the election portal after last week s vote.  In a report, they supplied a photo taken by their observers of the tally sheet for Bashaal market center in Garissa. It showed 133 votes for Kenyatta while the form displayed online showed 433 votes. Another form posted on the election website, from Tumbeni primary school in Kakamega, showed four votes for Odinga and two for another minor candidate but recorded the total number of votes cast was 77 votes cast.

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Sally Jones, a British jihadi who recruited online for the Islamic State group, has been killed in Syria by a U.S. drone along with her 12-year-old son, The Sun newspaper reported on Thursday. A convert to Islam from southern England, Jones was nicknamed the  White Widow  by the British press after her jihadi husband Junaid Hussain, also an IS militant, was killed by a drone in 2015. Quoting a British intelligence source who had been briefed by U.S. counterparts, The Sun reported that Jones and her son had been killed in June close to Syria s border with Iraq, as she was attempting to flee the IS stronghold of Raqqa. U.S. intelligence chiefs were quoted as saying they could not be 100 percent certain that Jones had been killed as there was no way of recovering any DNA from the ground, but they were  confident  she was dead. Her son JoJo was presumed to be dead too, although his presence with her was not known at the time of the drone strike and he was not an intended target, according to The Sun. British Prime Minister Theresa May s spokesman declined to comment directly on the report, as did Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.  If you are a British national in Iraq or Syria, and if you have chosen to fight for Daesh, an illegal organization that is preparing and inspiring terror attacks on our streets, then you ve made yourself a legitimate target,  Fallon told reporters in London.   And you run the risk every hour of every day of being on the wrong end of an RAF or a United States missile,  he said. One Western security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Jones had not been heard of since earlier this year so the assumption was that she was dead, although the source refused to confirm the details of the Sun report.  Other IS militants have been reported dead only to reappear. A Central Intelligence Agency spokeswoman declined to comment. Jones, who before her jihadi days was once a singer in a punk band, has been the subject of years of fascination by the British press. She was believed to have left her home in Chatham, in the southern county of Kent, in 2013 to travel to Syria, where she married Hussain whom she had met online. She was active as an online recruiter and sometimes posted propaganda messages on social media, including a striking photograph of herself dressed as a nun pointing a gun toward the camera. ",

        "title": "'It's like kumbaya:' Trump's genial private meetings with CEOs jar with public attacks",
        "text": " WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When the bosses of some of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies headed to Washington in January to meet U.S. President Donald Trump, it had all the makings of a potentially hostile meeting.  Just weeks before, Trump had sent drug stock prices plummeting after accusing the companies of \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d by charging too much for medicines.  But the Trump who greeted chief executives of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), Novartis (NOVN.S), Merck (MRK.N), Eli Lilly (LLY.N), Celgene (CELG.O) and Amgen (AMGN.O) on Jan. 31 was a surprisingly genial host who even gave them a personal tour of the Oval Office, according to several participants in the breakfast.  \u201cThere is no question that it was better than it could have been or we thought it could be,\u201d said one industry insider familiar with the meeting.  Trump did not repeat his public attacks on the industry. Instead, he focused on \u201coutdated\u201d regulations that drive costs up for drugmakers, according to participants interviewed by Reuters. The CEOs left with Trump\u2019s word that he would streamline regulations and reform the high U.S. corporate tax rate.  Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has held at least nine meetings with groups of business leaders, including automakers, airlines, retailers and health insurers. On Wednesday, he was hosting lunch for a group of New York real estate developers and private equity CEOs, during which possible private-public partnerships on infrastructure would be discussed, according to a person briefed on the meeting. In early morning or late-night tweets and in speeches, Trump has lambasted many of these companies for cost over-runs, or high prices, or foreign manufacturing, often knocking down their share prices.  But Reuters interviews with nearly a dozen executives and lobbyists who have taken part in these meetings or have been briefed on them reveal a Trump who is very different from his uncompromising and demanding @realDonaldTrump Twitter handle.  When he meets the nation\u2019s top chief executives in person, he is a mix of charm and cajoling. This Trump is flexible and inquisitive, a schmoozer who remembers birthdays and often lavishes praise on their companies, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity so they could freely discuss private meetings.  This private side of Trump sheds light on why many CEOs have expressed confidence that the Republican president is good for business, despite his share-denting public attacks. As recently as Tuesday, Trump tweeted he was working on a system to increase competition in the health industry and lower drug pricing, sending pharma shares lower.  In the White House meetings, Trump focuses much of his talk on cutting regulations, the sources said, underscoring one of his administration\u2019s key priorities - getting rid of rules imposed by his predecessor Barack Obama. He typically asks which regulations are holding businesses back from adding new jobs and promises to resolve the issues, executives say.  \u201cHe said one thing for the cameras and the door shuts and then it\u2019s like kumbaya,\u201d said one person who was briefed on a meeting between Trump and a group of CEOs.  \u201cHe likes to be seen as engaging and buddy buddy with other big important business leaders,\u201d said this person.  A former businessman, Trump runs his closed-door meetings with CEOs as if they were a corporate board meeting, attendees said. In contrast to his doctrinaire tweets, he likes to seek input from everyone at the table, and compared to former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, conversations are less scripted.  Trump\u2019s approach to these meetings is \u201cone of listening and not lecturing\u201d, said a senior White House official who has participated in industry meetings. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a president who is listening and asking questions to get to how he can create a thriving economy,\u201d the official said.  An Amgen spokeswoman said Trump made it clear that he wanted to work with the company on U.S. job creation and biotech innovation. Representatives of the other drugmakers declined to comment.  Because so little is known about how Trump interacts privately with CEOs, trade groups and company officials have begun to swap tips on how to approach their meetings with him.  \u201cThere is this undercurrent of information sharing about what to expect, what to do,\u201d said one trade group official who prepared CEOs for a recent meeting with Trump. He said he has gotten a flurry of calls from other industries next in line for a White House visit.  At the end of most meetings, Trump leads CEOs into the Oval Office, showing off paintings, sculptures and the furniture, as well as the rug and curtains he has picked out. He also points out a bust of Martin Luther King Jr., which he inherited from Obama. Then he takes a group photo behind the desk.  \u201cHe becomes tour guide and brings them over to the Oval Office,\u201d the same official said. \u201cHe\u2019s very proud of the Oval Office.\u201d  The White House official said Trump recognized the \u201cawe\u201d of the Oval Office.  Chief executives of Detroit\u2019s top three automakers - General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) - were pleasantly surprised when they went to the White House for a breakfast with Trump on Jan. 24.  Since his election, Trump has frequently attacked the car companies for building in Mexico and warned U.S. firms would no longer be able to move U.S. jobs abroad \u201cwithout consequences.\u201d  When Trump entered the Roosevelt Room, he greeted GM CEO Mary Barra with a playful tap on the shoulder as he gently prodded her to add jobs in the United States and later pulled out her chair before the meeting started, a review of the video transcripts of the first part of the meeting shows.  He greeted Ford CEO Mark Fields with a \u201cHappy Birthday. It\u2019s his birthday ladies and gentlemen.\u201d Trump said it was a \u201cgreat honor\u201d to see Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne.  Trump did not specifically ask them to build plants in the United States - as he had tweeted he would before the meeting - but instead listened to their complaints about regulations and indicated a willingness to help them, people briefed on the meeting said.  Ford declined to comment and referred to Fields\u2019 comments to dealers in January that Trump had asked for a list of regulations that automakers wanted cut or kept.  GM CEO Mary Barra said in a speech last week that Trump \u201creally listened\u201d to the automakers, while Marchionne told reporters at the Geneva auto show on Tuesday that Trump was \u201cquite willing to make our lives easier\u201d in terms of compliance and taxes in order to encourage U.S. job creation.  Trump has been complimentary of his high-profile guests - and at times playful.  After Denise Morrison, chief executive of Campbell Soup (CPB.N), introduced herself in one of those meetings, Trump quickly responded: \u201cGood soup.\u201d  At another, after Target Corp (TGT.N) CEO Brian Cornell spoke, Trump responded by pronouncing the name of the company as \u201cTar-Jay,\u201d a common joke to make the retailer sound more fancy.

        "title": "Czechs pin hopes on billionaire Babis to fix their country",
        "text": "PRAGUE (Reuters) - The traffic jams and roadworks that snarl the 200 km main highway from the capital Prague to the southeast are a symbol of how many Czechs feel their government is broken - and how they are looking for a new champion to fix it. A ring road around Prague is nowhere near completion after decades of zoning setbacks, a rail link to Prague s airport has been debated for 20 years without a shovel going in the ground.  The World Bank ranks the country 130th in the world when it comes to efficiency in issuing building permits, the worst in the European Union. In the Oct 20-21 election, voters look set to hand power to a man who says he can sort it all out: billionaire businessman Andrej Babis, whose anti-establishment rhetoric is reminiscent of U.S. President Donald Trump.   I see results, the others are only talkers,  said Erwin Heinl after meeting Babis at a pensioners club in Varnsdorf, 125 km (75 miles) north of Prague.  It is the only possible choice.  The central European country joined the EU in 2004 and has made great strides in economic development. But people feel wages and public services have been slow to catch up with the richer West while business sharks made billions in often murky privatizations and public contracts.  Babis, whose ANO party is far ahead of rivals in the polls, has been able to sell himself as a man fighting obstacles from coalition partners, while taking credit for popular decisions such as pension hikes during his time as finance minister. The bet on Babis is not straightforward. As the second richest Czech, he grew his chemicals, food and media empire in the same environment he and voters criticize. He is also not a new face, having governed as junior partner to the center-left Social Democrats since 2014.   Social Democrats still stand for the old rule and ANO is a symbol of the new rule, hence its credit for the economic success, government stability and so on,  said Daniel Prokop from the Median polling agency.  Many people respect Babis for his business approach to management which he says politicians lack.  He is skillful as a businessman, he could show that also running the state,  Karina Brtinska, 63, said after meeting Babis at a campaign stop at the main square in Varnsdorf. His successes include a budget surplus last year. Babis, as finance minister until May this year before he was removed by the prime minister, raised revenue by introducing value-added tax cross-checks and real-time reporting of shop sales.  But the budget was chiefly helped by economic growth, low interest rates, and a drop in public investments resulting from issues such as slow preparation of road building that meant less spending.  His ANO has held the Transport Ministry for the past four years. Czechs built close to 160 km of highways in the past 10 years, compared with 2,300 km in Poland 250 km in Slovakia.  The Czechs also pledged to raise defense spending, but under ANO running the Defence Ministry it dropped below 1 percent of GDP before a small pick up this year, still far away from the NATO goal of 2 percent.  Babis has also shaken off the impact of investigation for alleged fraud in tapping a 2 million euro subsidy - a charge that could carry a jail sentence. He denies any wrongdoing and portrays it as an attempt by adversaries to block him from sweeping out graft.  He is not afraid of anyone. He is honest,  said Anna Havelkova, an ANO supporter in Varnsdorf. Babis put his Agrofert group of more than 250 companies into a trust fund this year but remains the fund s beneficiary. Agrofert has been receiving farming and investment subsidies and also has numerous deals with the public sector, raising criticism from rivals and media of conflicts of interests.  Babis had acknowledged having conflicts of interest prior to moving Agrofert to the trust funds but said he never abused it.  Forbes puts Babis s net worth at 88 billion crowns ($4.01 bln), up from 40 billion in 2013 just before he joined the government. ANO voters are also unfazed by Babis  membership of the Communist party before a democratic revolution in 1989, or his contacts with secret police at the time.  Success is always accompanied by envy. Everyone has a past, but I am interested in the present. He has a vision and I believe he can fulfill it,  said businessman Slavomir Svitana attending Babis  rally in downtown Prague.    ",

        "title": "Trump sold all his shares in companies in June: spokesman",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump sold all of his shares in companies in June, aides said on Tuesday, a move that likely raised substantial cash ahead of the presidential election and could now ease some concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Trump\u2019s stock portfolio included shares of companies including Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co and a host of others, according to a financial disclosure form filed in May. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in an email that Trump sold all of his shares, but he did not respond to questions about what Trump did with the sales proceeds or whether he withdrew from any other investments at the same time.  The Republican\u2019s transition team did not provide documentation of the sales. Trump will not have to file a new financial disclosure form until May 2018, according to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. Presidents typically provide some such information voluntarily during their first year in office. Selling his shares would reduce some potential for conflicts for the businessman-turned-politician as he prepares to take over the White House from Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20. It would not address concerns about Trump\u2019s personal and family business activities, which include hotels and golf resorts from Panama to Scotland. Trump has said he will step back from running his business, but he has not given any detail about the arrangements. During the presidential campaign, Trump indicated he had pulled back from the stock market. \u201cI did invest, and I got out, and it was actually very good timing,\u201d he told Fox Business in an August interview. The issue arose after Trump urged the government to cancel an order with Boeing Co for a revamped Air Force One presidential plane. The New York real estate developer, who defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election, said, without citing proof, that costs for the aircraft were out of control.\t Trump had previously said he owned Boeing shares. Asked earlier on Tuesday whether the president-elect still owned them, Miller said Trump sold all his shares in June, but it was not clear at the time whether he was speaking only about Boeing stock.

        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was \u201ctotal nonsense\u201d that Russian officials had assembled a file of compromising information on U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Two U.S. officials said on Tuesday evening that the heads of four U.S. intelligence agencies had last week presented Trump with classified documents which included unverified claims that Russian intelligence operatives had compromising information about him. Addressing reporters on a conference call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the dossier containing the claims was a hoax which had been dreamt up to further harm U.S.-Russia relations, which are already at their lowest level since the Cold War.  \u201cIt is an attempt to damage our bilateral relations. It is pulp fiction,\u201d said Peskov, who also roundly dismissed as false assertions in the dossier that he himself was heavily involved in running a Russian campaign to undermine defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \u201cYou have to react to this with a certain humor, but there\u2019s also a sad side to this. Hysteria is being whipped up to maintain a political witch hunt.\u201d Peskov said the Kremlin did not engage in compiling compromising dossiers on anyone and was focused on building relations with Russia\u2019s foreign partners instead. On Tuesday evening, Trump dismissed the reports that Russia had compromising information on him. \u201cFAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\u201d he wrote in a Twitter post. Asked to respond to the prospect of new U.S. sanctions affecting Russia\u2019s oil and gas sector, Peskov said such measures, if they happened, would damage Russia, bilateral ties, and the global economy. The Russian energy sector would definitely get compensation if such sanctions were imposed, he added. Peskov said the Kremlin was unfazed by reports that Trump\u2019s pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, would say at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday that Russia posed a danger. It has previously praised Tillerson, who has experience of working with top Russian officials in the oil sector. Peskov said the Kremlin stood by its assessment of Tillerson as someone who was willing to listen and was constructive, but was aware he was likely to be a tough operator too. \u201cWe understand that Tillerson will continue to be quite tough in pursuing his line,\u201d said Peskov, saying the Kremlin was not wearing rose-tinted glasses when it came to the former U.S. oilman.

        "title": "Duterte berates Canada's Trudeau at end of Philippines summit",
        "text": "MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte attacked Canada s Justin Trudeau at the end of a summit of Asian and Western nations for raising questions about his war on drugs, a topic skirted by other leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump. At the traditional news conference by the host nation at the end of the summit on Tuesday, Duterte was asked how he had responded to the Canadian prime minister raising the issue of human rights and extra-judicial killings in his anti-drugs drive.  I said I will not explain. It is a personal and official insult,  the Philippines president said in the course of a rambling answer, although he did not refer to Trudeau by name.  I only answer to the Filipino. I will not answer to any other bullshit, especially foreigners. Lay off.  Earlier in the day, Trudeau told a news conference that during his meeting with Duterte  the president was receptive to my comments and it was throughout a very cordial and positive exchange . Human rights activists had been hoping that leaders at the summit, including Trump, would raise the issue of the thousands of users and small-time pushers killed in the campaign that was launched by Duterte after he took office in mid-2016. His government says the police act in self-defense during drug-busts, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability. There was no pressure from Trump on the drugs war when he met Duterte on Monday and the U.S. president later said the two had a  great relationship . A joint statement after the meeting only said the two sides  underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs.  Duterte cursed Trump s predecessor, Barack Obama, last year for raising concerns about the war on drugs and he subsequently declared that he was breaking ties with the United States, a close ally of the Philippines since World War Two. The relationship appears to have got back on track after the bonhomie between him and Trump. Trudeau also said that he raised the issue of the exodus of Rohingya during a meeting with Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, another sensitive topic bypassed by most other leaders, although he did not mention the Muslim minority by name.  This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,  he said. The government in mostly-Buddhist Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and does not recognize the term. Over 600,000 Rohingya have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh since military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on Aug. 25.  The plight of the Rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and the United Nations has called the operations ethnic cleansing. There have been calls for democracy champion Suu Kyi to be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the military s actions. Some countries in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), particularly Muslim-majority Malaysia, have voiced strong concern over the issue recently. However, in keeping with ASEAN s principle of non-interference in each others  internal affairs, it appeared to have been put aside at the summit, which brought Southeast Asian nations together with the United States, Russia, Japan, China, India, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Duterte reported that China had agreed at the summit to work on a code of conduct in the South China Sea with ASEAN nations to ease tensions over disputed claims to the busy and resource-rich waterway. The group also signed agreements on protecting migrant labor and fighting terrorism and cybercrime. Trump skipped the plenary session of the summit because of scheduling delays, but he said his marathon trip to Asia had been a  tremendous  success. He told reporters on Air Force One that he had delivered his prepared remarks during a lunch before the summit meeting.  Trump said at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure, of deals had been agreed in the trip. He did not elaborate.  We ve explained that the United States is open for trade but we want reciprocal, we want fair trade for the United States,  he said. Trade and concern about possible protectionism under Trump s  America First  agenda have come up during his visit to the region, which included stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam before concluding in the Philippines. After Trump left Manila, a group of Asia-Pacific nations pursuing a separate Beijing-backed trade deal that does not include the United States agreed to  intensify efforts  in 2018 to bring their negotiations to a conclusion. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) appeared to have been given new impetus at the summit by Trump s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, to which China is not party. The two trade deals are not mutually exclusive. ASEAN is joined in the RCEP talks by China, India, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. ",

        "title": "Obama says reducing leaker Chelsea Manning's prison term serves justice",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Wednesday that former military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning had served a tough prison term and his decision to commute her 35-year sentence to about seven years served would not signal leniency toward leakers of U.S. government secrets. Obama told his final news conference as president that he felt it made sense to commute Manning\u2019s sentence because she went to trial, took responsibility for her crime and her sentence was disproportionate to those received by other leakers. \u201cChelsea Manning has served a tough prison sentence,\u201d Obama said of his decision to reduce her sentence, which was announced Tuesday in a batch of 209 commutations and 64 pardons granted. \u201cI feel very comfortable that justice has been served.\u201d  Manning gave classified information of more than 700,000 documents, videos, diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks in 2010, the biggest such breach in U.S. history.  Congressional Republicans criticized the commutation as a dangerous precedent for leakers. Sean Spicer, the press secretary for President-elect Donald Trump, told reporters Wednesday it sent a \u201cvery troubling message.\u201d Obama said the commutation was done without regard to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who said on Twitter last Thursday that if Manning was freed, he would accept extradition to the United States, where there is an open criminal investigation into the activities of WikiLeaks.  \u201cI don\u2019t pay a lot of attention to Mr. Assange\u2019s tweets,\u201d Obama said, adding that he did not see a contradiction with his administration\u2019s approach to Assange and Manning and referring more questions on WikiLeaks to the Justice Department. \u201cWhat I can say broadly in this new cyber age, we\u2019re going to have to continually work to find the right balance of accountability and openness and transparency that is the hallmark of our democracy, but also recognize that there are adversaries and bad actors out there who want to use that same openness in ways that hurt us,\u201d Obama said. Barry Pollack, a U.S.-based lawyer for Assange, said in an email Wednesday that Obama\u2019s commutation of Manning fell \u201cwell short\u201d of what Assange sought because he had called for her \u201cto receive clemency and be released immediately.\u201d A U.S. official said the Justice Department was  investigating \u201ccivilian\u201d individuals associated with the leaking of government secrets via WikiLeaks. \u201cThe Department of Justice is conducting an investigation and it remains ongoing. I am not able to provide any further information,\u201d said Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Alexandria, Virginia. WikiLeaks returned to prominence during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, publishing hacked emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and the accounts of senior Democrats.  U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian intelligence agencies were responsible for the hacks and that they were carried out as part of a campaign by Moscow to help Republican Donald Trump win and discredit Democrat Hillary Clinton. Obama said the intelligence agencies were not conclusive in their assessment of the hacks \u201cwhether WikiLeaks was witting or not in being a conduit\u201d for Russia\u2019s efforts to use cyber attacks to influence the election. Assange has said the Russian government was not the source of the emails. Manning, formerly known as U.S. Army Private First Class Bradley Manning, was born male but revealed after being convicted of espionage that she identifies as a woman. The White House said on Tuesday that her sentence would end on May 17 this year. Manning twice tried to kill herself last year and has struggled to cope as a transgender woman in the Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, men\u2019s military prison. Her case became a rallying cause for civil liberties advocates who saw the punishment as too severe and an attempt to chill whistleblowers from speaking up about government misdeeds. ",

        "title": "What we know about U.S. probes of Russian meddling in 2016 election",
        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. intelligence agencies have alleged that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to benefit President Donald Trump. Law enforcement agencies and congressional committees are investigating Russian meddling and possible collusion with members of Trump\u2019s campaign. Here is what is publicly known and not known:   How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the  election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017. What did the intelligence agencies find?  The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome. The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a clear preference for Trump to win the White House. Putin\u2019s  associates hacked information, paid social media \u201ctrolls\u201d and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said.  The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. How many U.S. investigations are there into Russian election meddling? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscow\u2019s role in the election, including possible collusion with Trump\u2019s campaign. The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it had appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe. Mueller would, if the evidence merits, work in tandem with the FBI to handle any related criminal prosecutions. In addition, there are multiple committees in the Senate and House of Representatives investigating various aspects of Russian election meddling. What has Trump said about Russia\u2019s role in the election? He has not taken a clear public position. At a July 2016 news conference, Trump addressed an FBI probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted by saying: \u201cI will tell you this, Russia: if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d He subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf.    The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration. \u201cAs far as hacking, I think it was Russia,\u201d Trump said, although he added: \u201cIt could have been others also.\u201d Trump said in May that China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials. Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed. \u201cThe Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?\u201d he wrote on Twitter on May 8. On May 30, Trump tweeted: \u201cRussian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.\u201d Did the FBI probe continue after Comey\u2019s dismissal? There is no evidence that the FBI ended or paused its investigation after Comey\u2019s departure. Andrew McCabe, who is leading the agency as acting director, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comey\u2019s firing would not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it.  Trump on June 6 chose former U.S. Justice Department official Christopher Wray, who represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, to be the next FBI director. Wray will need Senate confirmation. Why was Comey fired? The White House cited a May 9 letter to Trump from Attorney General Jeff Sessions that attached a memo from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on \u201cRestoring Confidence in the FBI\u201d that recommended Comey\u2019s dismissal. Rosenstein\u2019s memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosenstein\u2019s view was that Comey\u2019s decision to make a public statement broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch. Trump called Comey a \u201cshowboat\u201d and \u201cgrandstander\u201d in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosenstein\u2019s recommendation. Was Comey\u2019s firing related to the FBI\u2019s Russia probe? Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believes his dismissal was directly related to the FBI\u2019s Russia probe. \u201cI know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation, was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that,\u201d Comey said in his June 8 testimony. Trump asked Comey to end the agency\u2019s investigation of Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, and also to make some sort of public statement that he was not personally under investigation in order to clear \u201cthe cloud\u201d hanging over his presidency, according Comey\u2019s testimony. Comey said he found it concerning that Trump would ask him to drop the agency\u2019s probe of Flynn and declined to state publicly that Trump himself was not under investigation, in part because it would create a \u201cduty to correct\u201d if that changed. \u201cI need loyalty, I expect loyalty,\u201d Trump told Comey at a Jan. 27 dinner, according to Comey. Less than a week before he was fired, Comey told a congressional panel that it made him \u201cmildly nauseous\u201d that he may have affected the outcome of the election by publicly re-opening and then re-closing the Clinton email probe days before the election. In an unorthodox move, Great America Alliance, an offshoot of a pro-Trump super PAC devoted to promoting the White House agenda, developed a television ad called \u201cShowboat\u201d to air as Comey testified. The ad claims Comey was \u201cconsumed with election meddling\u201d at the expense of fighting terrorism. Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Flynn was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. He provided the first batch on June 6. Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Rosenstein is handling matters related to Russia and it is he who appointed Mueller as special counsel. Is Trump himself under investigation?  Mueller\u2019s probe has expanded to include examining whether Trump obstructed justice by attempting to curtail the FBI\u2019s probe of Russian meddling, the Washington Post reported on June 14. In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he had thanked Comey for informing him that he was not under investigation. Comey has confirmed that Trump was not personally under investigation at any point before his dismissal from the FBI. The Post reported the scope of the probe expanded to include Trump shortly after Comey\u2019s dismissal, citing government officials. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Roadside apartments, industrial lots and a trailer park in New Jersey counted among the sources of wealth for Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law, before he took up his new role as a senior White House adviser. A lengthy financial disclosure form released on Friday by the White House, along with scores of others for senior White House staffers, showed the downscale New Jersey roots of the family business run until recently by Ivanka Trump\u2019s husband. For instance, in the 12 months before he began his White House employment, Kushner made more than $2,500 in rental income from tenants of Union, New Jersey\u2019s Park Lane Mobile Home Park. A small, industrial lot nearby brought in no more than $5,000. In the town of Wayne, New Jersey, Kushner disclosed ownership of a block of street-level apartments that returned more than $15,000, according to the paperwork. Kushner\u2019s stakes in such holdings were among the smallest he reported. White House ethics officials said the legally required disclosure document gave a snapshot of the assets and positions Kushner held when he entered his new job as adviser to his father-in-law, and before he would have started selling assets that could pose conflicts of interest. Kushner\u2019s 54-page report also included most of the assets and income of his wife. It covered scores of assets worth six- and seven-figures. The New York Times reported the couple\u2019s real estate and investment empire was worth as much as $741 million. As reported, Kushner\u2019s property portfolio did not rival the collection of glitzy hotels, casinos and golf courses owned, controlled or licensed by the president. But Kushner reported an interest in the Puck Building, a landmark in New York City. It was one of his most valuable holdings and delivered millions of dollars in income. Kushner\u2019s grandfather anchored the family real estate business in northern New Jersey. His father, Charles, built that empire until 2004 when he pleaded guilty to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and making unlawful campaign donations and was sentenced to two years in prison.

        "title": "Jailed Kremlin critic calls on Russians to protest on Putin's birthday",
        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny called on his supporters on Wednesday to hold street protests this weekend across Russia, in defiance of an official ban, to demand that Navalny be allowed to run in next year s presidential election. Navalny, a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin, was jailed for 20 days on Monday for repeatedly violating laws governing the organization of public meetings and rallies. His arrest, the third this year, means that he will miss a campaign rally planned in Putin s hometown of St Petersburg on Oct. 7 - the Russian leader s birthday. Appealing to his supporters via his Facebook page, Navalny called on them to attend protests in both St Petersburg and Moscow on Saturday, adding that 80 of his support groups were meanwhile organizing protests across Russia.  Our task is to make Oct. 7 the day when every decent person will pronounce aloud or to himself at least these two demands: political competition and Navalny s admission to the polls,  he said in the appeal, which he said he had dictated from jail. The authorities have banned the planned weekend rallies in Moscow and St Petersburg, and the Kremlin warned on Tuesday that those calling for the protests would be prosecuted. Putin said earlier on Wednesday that he had not yet decided whether he would run for re-election in March 2018, something he is widely expected to do. Opinion polls show that if both Putin and Navalny were running, the incumbent would win by a wide margin. ",

        "title": "U.S. Senator McCain opposes Obamacare repeal bill, a possible fatal blow",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain said on Friday he opposes the latest Republican bill to dismantle Obamacare, dealing the measure what could be a fatal blow given the party\u2019s slim Senate majority. With several other Republicans still undecided on the measure, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said earlier this week he intended to bring it to the Senate floor for a vote next week, though he did not promise to do so. A vote would set the stage for another dramatic Capitol Hill decision on the 2010 law that brought health insurance to millions of Americans and became former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement. For seven years, Republicans have hammered Obamacare as an unwarranted government intrusion into American healthcare. President Donald Trump made repealing Obamacare one of his top campaign promises in 2016. Democrats have fiercely defended it. The announcement by McCain, a Republican who has often been at odds with Trump and who cast a crucial \u201cno\u201d vote in July that helped defeat an earlier Republican repeal bill, had the potential to up-end McConnell\u2019s plans. McConnell\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. At a rally in Alabama, Trump said McCain\u2019s decision was \u201ctotally unexpected, terrible.\u201d Despite the setback, Trump said: \u201cWe still have a chance. We\u2019re going to do it eventually.\u201d Republicans have only a narrow Senate majority and cannot afford to lose many votes on the bill. They are also on a tight timetable. McConnell has been trying to schedule a vote on the bill by Sept. 30, the last day on which the bill could pass with only a simple majority of 51 votes in the Senate. A vote taken any later than that would have to garner at least 60 votes for passage. Weeks after the humiliating defeat in July, when the Obamacare repeal fight seemed to be over, the current bill was introduced by Republican Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham, a close friend of McCain\u2019s, and seemed to gain momentum. But McCain on Friday laid out his opposition in a statement: \u201cI cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal.\u201d He said he took no pleasure in announcing his opposition and noted that the bill\u2019s authors \u201care my dear friends.\u201d McCain complained about the rushed process Republicans used to push the bill forward. He said he would consider supporting a bill like it if it had emerged from extensive hearings, debate and amendment. \u201cBut that has not been the case,\u201d he said.  McCain, who cast his \u201cno\u201d vote in July just days after being diagnosed with an aggressive brain cancer, said he could not support the bill without knowing how much it would cost, how it would affect insurance premiums and \u201chow many people will be helped or hurt by it,\u201d information that will not be available until the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office provides a full assessment at the end of September. The Graham-Cassidy bill would take federal money spent on the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, as well as subsidies to help Americans buy private insurance, and divvy it up to the states in block grants. Advocates say that would give states more discretion to manage their own healthcare schemes. Although the CBO has not yet fully assessed the bill\u2019s effects, independent analyses indicate it would fundamentally redistribute federal healthcare money, generally with Republican-leaning states benefiting and Democratic-leaning states losing, largely because a majority of the states that opted to expand Medicaid under Obamacare were Democratic-leaning. A Washington Post-ABC News opinion poll said Americans prefer Obamacare to the Graham-Cassidy alternative by 56 percent to 33 percent. Graham said in a statement he was not giving up. \u201cWe press on,\u201d he said. Shares of health insurers turned up after McCain announced his oppositions. Centene ended 1.6 percent higher while Humana closed up 0.2 percent, reversing earlier losses.  State-by-state impacts from Graham-Cassidy would vary, the Axios news website reported on Friday, citing a study by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the unit of the Department\u00a0of Health and Human Services that oversees Medicaid and the Obamacare program. The CMS study found that by 2026, Alaska would lose 38 percent of its federal funding for insurance subsidies and Medicaid; Arizona would lose 9 percent; Maine would gain 44 percent; Ohio would lose 18 percent; and West Virginia would lose 23 percent, Axios reported. These states are home to Republican senators who are under pressure on healthcare. Both of Alaska\u2019s Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, are still on the fence over Graham-Cassidy. The CMS had no immediate comment on the Axios report. Besides McCain, Kentucky\u2019s Rand Paul is the only other Republican senator who has publicly said he opposes the bill. Maine\u2019s Susan Collins said she was leaning against the bill, the Portland Press-Herald newspaper reported on Friday. Kansas\u2019 Jerry Moran is also undecided. No Democrats support the bill. To pass Graham-Cassidy, the Republicans need at least 50 votes in the 100-seat Senate, which they control 52-48, with Vice President Mike Pence casting a potential tie-breaking vote. The insurance industry, hospitals, medical advocacy groups such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and American Cancer Society, the AARP advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists oppose the bill. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Washington, estimated the bill would cause more than 30 million people to lose insurance. ",

        "title": "Temporary U.S. government funding bill hits snag in Senate",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday overwhelmingly passed legislation to keep federal agencies funded until April 28 and avert government shutdowns at the end of this week when existing appropriations expire. By a vote of 326-96, the House passed the legislation that is now before the Senate where it has encountered opposition from Democrats who are upset over the refusal by Republicans to include a long-term extension of expiring healthcare benefits for retired coal miners and their families. Instead, the bill would continue the benefits only until next April. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything this callous in my life,\u201d said West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. As a result, the Senate might not be able to vote on the spending bill until sometime this weekend, technically putting the U.S. government into a partial shutdown mode on Saturday. Flint, Michigan, which has endured a two-and-a-half-year struggle with lead-contaminated drinking water, would get access to a $170 million fund for infrastructure improvements and lead poisoning prevention under the bill. The stop-gap funding bill reflects the inability of the Republican-controlled Congress to pass the dozen regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 and runs through Sept. 30, 2017, freezing most spending at current levels. Congress was unable to pass them in part because of internal disagreements among Republicans on some of those measures and because Democrats held firm to an earlier budget deal that aims to restrain spending caps on defense as long as those caps were imposed on other domestic programs.          Congress likely will end up arguing well into 2017 over spending priorities for the current fiscal year even as it must begin considering funding government operations in fiscal 2018. Congress\u2019 delay in finishing its work also means that President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, will have some say in government spending priorities for the period of April 28-Sept. 30, instead of President Barack Obama. A provision is also embedded in the spending bill to make it easier for Trump to win confirmation of General James Mattis to be defense secretary early next year. Republicans demanded it to help Mattis get around a requirement that the defense secretary be a civilian for seven years before taking the job. Mattis retired from the military in 2013. The bill moving through Congress, as lawmakers try wrapping up their work for the year, contains $5.8 billion for waging military operations against the Islamic State worldwide. ",

        "title": "Erdogan says Turkey will close Iraq border and air space soon",
        "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday that Turkey would soon close its border with northern Iraq and shut its air space in response to last week s Kurdish independence referendum. Erdogan, who held talks in Tehran on Wednesday with Iranian leaders, also said Turkey would decide jointly with Iran and Iraq s central government in Baghdad whether to cut oil exports from Kurdish northern Iraq. His comments came 10 days after Kurds in northern Iraq voted overwhelmingly for independence, alarming Baghdad, Iraq s neighbors and Western powers who fear the vote could trigger further conflict in the Middle East. Turkey tightened controls at its main border crossing into Iraq in the immediate aftermath of the vote and suspended flights to northern Iraq. It has also held joint military exercises with Iraqi troops on the border. But it has not yet implemented threats to impose wider sanctions on the Kurdish region or to cut off the hundreds of thousands of barrels of Kurdish oil exported daily via Turkey to world markets.   Flights to northern Iraq have already been suspended, the air space and borders will also close soon,  Erdogan said in a speech in the Turkish capital, Ankara. He said the decision to hold the referendum showed the  perfect ingratitude  of the Kurdish Regional Government in northern Iraq, after years of close commercial and political ties with Turkey. Earlier, Erdogan told Turkish media on his return from Iran that Ankara, Tehran and Baghdad would jointly decide on whether to close the taps on the Kurds  oil export pipeline, adding that it was time for the KRG to take a step back.  The northern Iraqi leadership is drunk with the result of the referendum, it s not aware of what it is doing or what kind of steps it s taking,  he said. Erdogan also criticized the inclusion of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk in the referendum, saying that Kurds had no legitimacy there and that they were  invaders  in the region. During a joint news conference with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday, Erdogan said Turkey was considering further measures against northern Iraq, and the two leaders promised to work together against the independence drive. The Kurds are the region s fourth-largest ethnic group, spread across Iran, Turkey, Syria and Iraq. All of those oppose any moves toward a Kurdish state, but the Kurds have been building strong international ties. Last month, Russian oil major Rosneft clinched a gas pipeline deal in Iraq s autonomous Kurdistan to help it become a major exporter of gas to Turkey and Europe. The pipeline will be constructed in 2019 and exports will begin in 2020. On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that it was in no-one s interest to cut off oil supplies from Iraq s Kurdistan, which would raise oil prices. Erdogan, however, brushed off those concerns, saying the final decision would be made by Turkey, Iran and Iraq. ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - When U.S. Senate Republicans unveil their plan to overhaul America\u2019s healthcare system, they will face a skeptical public that already does not buy the justification for an earlier version that passed the House of Representatives, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.\u00a0  The June 9-13 poll shows that a majority of the country thinks the American Health Care Act would be harmful for low-income Americans, people with pre-existing health conditions and Medicaid recipients.  Overall, 41 percent of American adults oppose the House plan, while 30 percent support it. Another 29 percent said they \u201cdon\u2019t know,\u201d according to the poll.  \u201cIt\u2019ll make people\u2019s deductibles skyrocket\u201d said Shannon Sowards, 39, of Memphis, Tennessee, a Trump supporter who took the poll. \u201cSo I\u2019m not for this healthcare act. I\u2019m for insurance for everyone.\u201d The Senate is expected to release its full plan on Thursday. (Click here to view the poll's topline results: tmsnrt.rs/2sqhmM3) The gap between what Republicans say their plan will do and what people think it will do further complicates matters for Senate Republicans, who already have been criticized for drafting their bill in secret. \u201cIt would be great if a politican had the nerve to be brutally honest\u201d and tell people that healthcare costs are going up, said Joseph Antos, a healthcare expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cNone of them seem to.\u201d For years, Republicans have promised voters they would replace Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law, which they say is too costly and intrusive. When House Republicans pitched their health plan earlier this year, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan boasted that it would lower premiums, protect people with pre-existing conditions and improve public \u201caccess\u201d to high-quality, low-cost healthcare. U.S. Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, who helped shape the House bill, said it \u201cwould make coverage of pre-existing conditions sacrosanct for all Americans.\u201d The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, however, presented a different view of the bill. It estimated that under the House plan 23 million people would lose their health coverage by 2026 in an effort to cut the federal deficit. According to the poll, nearly 60 percent of adults said they thought it would make insurance more expensive for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing conditions. Fifty-seven percent said it would make Medicaid less available, and 69 percent said it would cut federal money for Planned Parenthood. Thirteen percent felt that the House plan would improve the quality of their healthcare, and 9 percent said it would make their healthcare cheaper. About 28 percent of Americans said they would be \u201cless likely\u201d to support their congressional representative if he or she supported the House plan. Another 16 percent said they would be \u201cmore likely\u201d to support their representative and 33 percent said it would make \u201cno difference.\u201d Republican respondents were more supportive of the House plan than others. And even those Republicans who did not like the House plan said that it is probably an improvement over the current healthcare system. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change my political views\u201d said Barb Huntington, 64, of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, a Trump supporter who took the poll.  Huntington, who buys health insurance through her state\u2019s Obamacare exchange, said her premiums went up by $25 per month this year. Huntington said she would not be surprised if they keep going up no matter what the Republicans do. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like that every year, and we\u2019ll be lucky to have what we have,\u201d she said. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It gathered responses from 1,492 adults, including 671 Democrats and 501 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group, 4 percentage points for Democrats and 5 percentage points for Republicans.

        "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkey s Tayyip Erdogan spoke on Saturday and agreed to continue to work toward stronger ties and regional security, Erdogan s office said, a day after he lashed out at U.S. authorities for indicting one of his ex-ministers. Ties between the United States and its NATO ally have been strained by Washington s support for the YPG Kurdish fighters in the battle against Islamic State in Syria. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group. Ankara has also been frustrated by what it sees as Washington s reluctance to extradite the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkey blames Gulen, who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999, for last year s failed coup.  Noting the strategic partnership between Turkey and the United States, the two leaders emphasized the importance of continuing to work together to further strengthen bilateral relations and increase stability in the region,  the Turkish Presidency said in a statement. The two leaders agreed to meet in New York at the United States General Assembly, scheduled for this month. The call was notable for its timing, coming a day after Erdogan described a U.S. prosecutor s indictment against Turkey s former economy minister as being politically motivated and tantamount to an attack on Ankara. The former minister, Zafer Caglayan, and the ex-head of a state-owned Turkish bank were charged this week with conspiring to violate Iran sanctions by illegally moving hundreds of millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on Tehran s behalf. The indictment marked the first time an ex-government member with close ties to Erdogan had been charged in the on-going U.S. investigation, which has strained ties between the two countries.  For the moment, it is impossible to evaluate this within legal logic,  he told reporters on Friday.  I see this step against our former economy minister as a step against the Turkish Republic. He had also called on Washington to re-think the charges.  I hope we ll get a chance to discuss this issue in the United States. You may be a big nation, but being a just nation is something else.

        "text": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian human rights lawyer and opposition leader Khaled Ali said on Monday he would challenge President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in the 2018 presidential election, provided he is not barred from the contest. Ali is the first person to announce he is running against Sisi, a former military commander who led the ouster of former President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood over four years ago. Ali told a news conference he would have a socialist platform, aiming to end austerity and redistribute wealth, and fight terrorism without compromising freedom. He criticized Sisi s administration, accusing it of suppressing freedoms and causing deteriorating economic and security conditions.  In spite of all the darkness, there is still hope. I call on all segments of society to unite in collective struggle to reclaim this hope and to rescue this nation,  he said.   It is because of this that I have decided today to launch a presidential campaign.  Sisi himself has yet to declare if he will run but is widely expected to do so. He won 97 percent of the vote in 2014. Many in Egypt see him as vital to stability in a country where unrest since 2011 has battered the economy. Under Sisi s presidency, thousands of dissidents have been jailed. The government has shut down independent media and heavily restricted the conducting of opinion polls. Ali said earlier on Monday security forces had raided a printing press and seized materials for his campaign, after media reports that he was expected to announce his candidacy. Security forces accused the owner of the press of printing  documents that harm national security , Ali told Reuters.    State news agency MENA said a  high ranking security source  denied police had raided a printing press. If it appeared elections were being rigged, Ali said, he would call for a boycott by opposition candidates, forcing Sisi to be the sole contender. Egypt s presidency could not be reached for comment on Ali s plan to run. State-owned newspaper al-Gomhuriya ran an article on Monday with the headline  Khaled Ali and the ploys of dwarves , attacking him as an attention-seeker. It said Ali had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and received illegal foreign funding. It did not provide evidence for its claims, which Ali denies. A Cairo court sentenced Ali in September to three months in jail for public indecency, over an allegedly rude hand gesture.  Ali has appealed, denying the charges which he says are politically motivated. If the guilty verdict is upheld he will not be allowed to run, even if he is not jailed. The 45-year-old gained prominence in January when he won a case that nullified a government transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, a deal that had prompted mass protests. It was after winning that case that Ali is alleged to have made the gesture. Egypt s reclaiming of the islands would be a cornerstone of his campaign, he said. He told Reuters in an interview in June the case had swayed the opinion of many former Sisi supporters who oppose ceding sovereign territory. Ali ran for president in 2012 and came seventh. He was the youngest candidate at 40, the minimum age required to run.  He now leads the leftwing Bread and Freedom Party, at least eight of whose members have been arrested since April on charges including  misusing social media to incite against the state  and insulting the president.

        "text": "(Reuters) - President Donald Trump opened the door on Tuesday to a broad overhaul of the U.S. immigration system and vowed to pursue massive tax relief for the middle class in a speech to Congress as he sought to rebound from a chaotic start to his presidency.     Trump said he was open to a broad overhaul of the U.S. immigration system, a shift from his hardline campaign rhetoric. He emphasized his desire to focus on problems at home by boosting the U.S. economy with tax reform, a $1 trillion infrastructure effort and an overhaul of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law, known as Obamacare.    BRIAN REYNOLDS, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NEW ALBION PARTNERS, NEW YORK \u201cThe speech showed the softer side of the President, but I think the media had let investors know this would be the case, so no surprise for markets on that front. \u201cThe speech lacked specifics as it related to financial markets. Again I don\u2019t think that is a surprise. \u201cWith no surprises and few financial specifics, it is likely that equity investors will focus on how many of his themes can be passed by Congress given how late it is getting in the legislative calendar. Skepticism over the likelihood of policy enactment may create a brief pullback in stocks at some point. \u201cThere was nothing in the speech, or in the President\u2019s agenda, that is likely to alter the behavior of corporate bond investors, who have been driving this equity bull market for eight years via debt-fueled buybacks. They bought a strong $18 billion of new corporate bonds on Tuesday in advance of the speech, and they will likely be back at work on Wednesday, putting their cash flows to work. I believe that these flows are likely to keep any stock market pullback brief and shallow.\u201d BUCKY HELLWIG, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, BB&T WEALTH MANAGEMENT, BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: \u201cThe speech was a summary of Trump\u2019s policies.  Stocks could move higher tomorrow as nothing has changed and stock investors are still expecting infrastructure build out, tax and regulatory relief, and changes in Affordable Care, but the timetable has not been clarified for these. Republican constituents may pressure Congress to step up the pace in moving the Trump agenda forward. \u201cSome specifics: pressure on drug margins, completion across state lines for healthcare organizations, military expenditures increasing \u2013 but nothing new here. \u201cFed policy will get more attention this week and next.  Manufacturing PMI tomorrow and employment report next Friday (March 10) will be watched.  Yellen will be speaking this Friday.  Fed funds futures showing a higher probability of  an increase at the FOMC March 15 meeting.\u201d J.J. FELDMAN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT MIRACLE MILE ADVISORS IN LA: \u201cThere was nothing really new,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good speech in that it was more uniting than divisive but from the market perspective it was status quo,\u201d \u201cThis probably wasn\u2019t the venue but if new details on tax reform are not coming soon there\u2019s going to be disappointment for sure.\u201c JUAN PEREZ, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON: \u201cTrump said a lot of things that are positive for financial markets such as spending a huge amount for infrastructure. Overall there were no real surprises as these are pronouncements that we have heard before. However, I expect that market gains from his speech would be subdued by the continued tone of protectionism in his statements. Anytime, you attack trade deals as Trump did, the market gets nervous.\u201d PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST  AT WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE IN ST. LOUIS, MO.  \u201cI was impressed though, or at least relieved, that it wasn\u2019t like his inauguration speech, it wasn\u2019t a challenge or a gauntlet thrown down to the opposition or to other countries. It was a speech that was more balanced and more presidential-sounding.  \u201cBut even as a state of the union address, which it sounded a lot like, it wasn\u2019t very specific. It especially and could have and didn\u2019t prioritize all of these different things he was talking about. Some of the policies are going to be very expensive - a trillion dollars for infrastructure, $100 billion a year, extra defense spending - the budget may not have room for all of that.  \u201cHe didn\u2019t talk at all about how they were going to fund any of that. He also didn\u2019t talk about tax reform, which I expected he would give Congress some marching orders in terms of what he wants - he hardly said anything about tax reform.  \u201cHe talked about the Affordable Care Act but again he didn\u2019t talk about any of the directives of are we going to repeal and replace now or repeal and replace later. He did say he wanted continuity but moderate Republicans are not convinced the conservative Republicans have that as a priority. So it may be even difficult to pass the ACA repeal in this budget bill.  \u201cHe was effective at reaching out to the other side, he was effective at times in being able to connect items. For example, connecting education as the way to break the cycle of poverty and then morphing or transitioning into violent crime and cutting down on that. Those were effective points and effective transitions.  But again not enough detail for investors and certainly the markets were chopping around while he was speaking. It wasn\u2019t a big market mover and we still have to wait for the details. I don\u2019t think we are going to see much change.  \u201cThere is no reason to sell, he didn\u2019t throw water on any of the agenda, he simply didn\u2019t clarify it any.\u201d \u201cI think the market is going to be positive. The market continues to see him as a good-for-business president. He\u2019s very pragmatic when it comes to business. In terms of getting these grand visions done, I don\u2019t think the market gives so much importance to that. When he spoke about cost cutting, that immediately resonates with everyone on Wall Street. That\u2019s easy stuff. That\u2019s low hanging fruit. It\u2019s really hard to grow revenues. But it\u2019s really easy to cut costs. There is so much fat. It\u2019s so over regulated. This is easy stuff. He said enough of that during the speech that he will resonate well. \u201cI think some people were probably looking for some meat on the bones. He definitely covered everything. It was more of a laundry list. There wasn\u2019t a lot of details. \u201cTo me, the tax reform is something everybody wants. Repatriation of money abroad is something that ever wants. Why not take care of those and then take care of the dicey things? Like Obamacare and immigration.\u201d OMER ESINER, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN EXCHANGE IN WASHINGTON DC \u201c(Trump\u2019s) mention of historic treaties and NATO specifically was reassuring for our allies globally, and in that sense it was probably reassuring for global financial markets as well.\u201d \u201c(The speech) was still probably light on actual details on the fiscal side of things. We got mention of a trillion dollar infrastructure spending package. I think it\u2019s very early so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily hang my hat on that number. It was largely absent of any major focus on the tax side of things. In terms of overall details, on the fiscal side of the equation, it was probably pretty light. But I think despite that on some level the market might be reassured by the more or less balanced tone of the speech. It was much more presidential than some of the previous speeches and commentary we\u2019ve gotten from the president.\u201d PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT IN CHICAGO \u201cThe devil is going to be in the details and I think that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t see the futures move too terribly much. The markets are still, show me what you are going to do, how is this all going to work and how are we paying for it. That\u2019s going to take probably a couple weeks to a couple months to get laid out.\u201d \u201cEverybody is looking for more details and we\u2019re still waiting.\u201d  \u201cI think expectations right now are really high all the way around and it\u2019s going to be a process. We\u2019re going to have to wait to see some of this develop.\u201d STEVE MASSOCCA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT WEDBUSH SECURITIES IN SAN FRANCISCO  \u201cI thought it went pretty well, certainly no land mines or explosions.\u201d \u201cFrom an investor\u2019s perspective there was no new information, no surprises good or bad. From the perspective of where money goes tomorrow, I don\u2019t see what we have learned that\u2019s new or different. ... But he burnished his image, so there\u2019s a positive there. He\u2019s a pro business president so that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d RANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING AND DERIVATIVES FOR CHARLES SCHWAB IN AUSTIN, TEXAS \u201cHe pretty much didn\u2019t say anything he hadn\u2019t said before so markets have no reason to react overly positively or overly negatively ... Would the market have liked details sure, but I don\u2019t think it was expecting them.\u201d  \u201cIf anything the market might move moderately higher tomorrow. It pulled back moderately today. The uptick in volatility today was a preparation for the potential for a downside move ... It was a little bit of hedging going on before an event that could move the market.\u201d  A key focus for Wednesday will be Personal Consumption Expenditures, a key inflationary measure that the U.S. Federal Reserve watches, Frederick said. BRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST AT WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT IN MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN:  \u201cHe was surprisingly detailed about what to replace Obamacare with. It\u2019s likely Congress will be able to take that up shortly as part of the 2017 budget and then quickly pivot to the 2018 budget which will deal with tax reform. That plan is much less developed, but he has time.\u201d On taxes, Jacobsen said: \u201cEvery deduction and credit that would need to be eliminated to lower tax rates in a budget-neutral way has strong defenders. That\u2019s how those deductions and credits got there. So, we\u2019ll just have to watch and wait to see which special interests President Trump will take on.\u201d TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF SOLARIS GROUP IN BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK. \u201cIt seemed to be a somewhat kinder and gentler Trump. He wasn\u2019t attacking individuals like he often does.\u201d \u201cThis remains a very pro-growth agenda and the markets like that, but I didn\u2019t hear anything new that would make it necessarily move ahead, except that he stuck to his guns to make his agenda items happen.\u201d STOCKS: U.S. stock futures were stronger at the start of Trump\u2019s address, with major indices 0.3 percent higher. They eased those gains as he spoke, with the S&P 500 E-mini futures last up 0.2 percent.  BONDS:  U.S. Treasury futures TYv1 dipped slightly ahead of his speech, and were last down 0.4 percent. FOREX: The dollar erased its earlier gains in Asia, with the market jittery as Trump\u2019s speech was short on details on his economic stimulus. The dollar/yen eased to around 112.80 yen JPY= from the day\u2019s high of 113.375 yen hit earlier, on hopes the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates this month.  ",

        "title": "Maltese journalist's son says she was murdered for exposing corruption",
        "text": "VALLETTA (Reuters) - The son of Malta s best-known investigative journalist said on Tuesday his mother had been killed by a car bomb because of her work exposing political corruption, as hundreds of people demonstrated to demand justice after her death. Daphne Caruana Galizia, who wrote about graft across Malta s political divides on her blog, died when explosives ripped through her car minutes after she left her home in the north of the island on Monday afternoon. Maltese authorities were waiting for the arrival of Dutch forensic experts and American FBI agents to help the investigations.  My mother was assassinated because she stood between the rule of law and those who sought to violate it, like many strong journalists,  Matthew Caruana Galizia said on Facebook.  She was also targeted because she was the only person doing so,  he added. He described rushing to the scene, only to find the burning car and her remains. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who was accused of wrong-doing by Caruana Galizia earlier this year and had been suing her over some of her allegations, denounced her killing and pledged to track down those responsible. But a small group booed Muscat on Tuesday evening when he left his office, and the opposition is calling for him to resign.  The prime minister and his government have been responsible for diminishing the rule of law in Malta,  opposition leader Adrian Delia told Reuters.  They have created an environment where people are afraid to speak out.  On Tuesday afternoon, several hundred people demonstrated in front of the law courts demanding justice for Caruana Galizia s killers.  The state did not defend Daphne,  shouted Andrew Borg Cardona, addressing the crowd. He said those who accused her of  going over the top  with her investigations  are all guilty . One woman carried a votive lamp with the murdered journalist s picture in it and another carried a sign that read  Looks like we can t have freedom of speech but we want justice . Recently, Caruana Galizia had been following up leads from information in the so-called Panama Papers, a large collection of documents from an offshore law firm in the Central American nation that were leaked in 2015. She was tracing alleged links between Maltese officials and offshore banks and companies used as tax havens. Half an hour before the explosion, Caruana Galizia wrote on her blog:  There are crooks everywhere you look now. The situation is desperate.  The European Commission told journalists it was horrified by the murder in the bloc s smallest state and called for justice. Spokesman Margaritis Schinas was asked if the Commission would open a procedure to check if Malta was meeting the EU s standards for the rule of law, a process now being applied to Poland over judicial reforms there. He replied:  We never speculate on these questions. These are very serious subjects ... This is an outrageous act that happened, and what matters now is that justice will be brought.   This is what we need to see.  The killing near the village of Bidnija stunned the Mediterranean island. Authorities said it was the first murder of a journalist there.  I saw a small explosion coming from the car and I panicked. A few seconds later, around three to four seconds, there was another, larger explosion,  said resident Frans Sant, who was driving in the other direction.  The car continued coming down the hill, skidding at high speed, full of fire. The car missed me by around 10 feet. I tried to help, but the fire was too much and the car ended up in the field,  he told Reuters Television. ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michelle Obama will be ceding the title of first lady to Melania Trump next month, but she may hold for some time the other distinction she earned during her time in the White House: America\u2019s best known advocate for healthy food. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The non-profit organization she helped create as first lady, Partnership for a Healthier America (PHA), where she is honorary chair, will continue its work convincing food companies to improve nutrition content and labeling of products, the group said. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMichelle Obama has been a tremendous leader in this space,\u201d said Larry Soler, president and chief executive of the group. \u201cThat legacy is going to continue for a long time after this.\u201d When President-elect Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress take over on Jan. 20, lawmakers are expected to take aim at what one of them has called \u201cburdensome new rules\u201d on food. School lunches and menu labeling standards are likely to be among the changes that may come under fire.  Trump, a self-professed fan of junk food, has not been explicit on what he plans to do with food policy, although he campaigned for the Nov. 8 election on a broad promise to undo regulations on business.  Nutrition advocates believe that, regardless of regulatory changes, private sector partnerships forged under Michelle Obama\u2019s time at PHA are likely to endure.  The first lady helped launch PHA in 2010, in conjunction with her broader \u2018Let\u2019s Move!\u2019 effort to tackle childhood obesity in the United States. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Since then, the organization has inked voluntary deals with scores of food companies, universities, hospitals and hotel chains aimed at improving nutritional content in food offerings. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Companies that have made such agreements, like the world\u2019s No.1 retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc and convenience store chain Kwik Trip, say they expect to uphold the commitments they have made regardless of any policy changes in Washington. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOur commitment to provide healthy food \u2013 specifically for young people \u2013 will not only continue but it will grow,\u201d said a spokesman for Wisconsin-based Kwik Trip, which agreed with PHA this year to offer more fruit, vegetables and whole-grain foods at its stores at low cost. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 PHA said its work will continue unabated after the Obamas leave the White House, and expects that consumer demand will continue to drive companies to participate. The first lady expects to continue her work on the issue, though it is unclear exactly what her role will be. \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI will always be here as a partner in this effort \u2013 always,\u201d she said earlier this year.  Michelle Obama took her healthy eating agenda from the White House - where she built an organic vegetable garden - to the halls of Congress, where she lobbied lawmakers in the passage in 2010 of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Republicans balked at renewing elements of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2015 and the House of Representatives introduced legislation that critics say would dial back access to the program.  Republican Representative Todd Rokita from Indiana this year introduced legislation to overhaul the school lunch program, in part to make sure that \u201cthe First Lady Michelle Obama-inspired nutrition standards are revised so that school food is more edible.\u201d He has also said he plans to work toward reforms of \u201cburdensome new rules\u201d with the new president.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0      Also under threat may be another measure to usher in more detailed labeling requirements for menus at restaurants and grocery stores, which passed as part of the 2010 health overhaul known as the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. Trump has said he will repeal Obamacare.  \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe have a sense of (Trump\u2019s) personal eating habits, but not his view of food policy. But given his anti-regulatory, anti-science rhetoric, we\u2019re on high alert,\u201d said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A spokesman for Trump\u2019s transition team did not respond to requests for comment. Melania Trump, who last month pinpointed cyber-bullying as her cause as first lady, has not mentioned interest in the healthy eating issue. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trump\u2019s early choices in building his administration have also triggered some concerns among healthy food advocates. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He has nominated Representative Tom Price of Georgia to head the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the National Institutes of Health and works to develop dietary guidelines with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Price is an opponent of Obamacare and voted for a bill that would have banned state labeling of genetically-modified ingredients. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trump has yet to select an agriculture secretary. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regardless of legislative repeals, supporters of Michelle Obama\u2019s efforts to get healthier food into mainstream America believe the impact of her work cannot be undone. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere was very little positive industry action before she got there. Health and obesity issues weren\u2019t on their agendas,\u201d said Sam Kass, a chef and former executive director of \u2018Let\u2019s Move!\u2019 who also served as President Barack Obama\u2019s nutrition policy advisor.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow it is the top priority for every CEO.\u201d ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has abandoned plans to create an infrastructure advisory council, the White House said on Thursday, the day after two other advisory groups were dismantled over the furor caused by Trump\u2019s remarks on white supremacists. \u201cThe President\u2019s Advisory Council on Infrastructure, which was still being formed, will not move forward,\u201d a White House official said. The decision to drop the planned council was first reported by Bloomberg. Trump signed an executive order last month establishing the council, with members to be drawn from real estate, construction, transportation and other sectors of the economy. Trump has proposed spending $1 trillion to fix aging U.S. roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure, a major part of his legislative agenda along with healthcare and tax reform. On Wednesday, Trump disbanded two high-profile advisory groups after several chief executives quit in protest over his remarks blaming violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend on anti-racism activists as well as white nationalists. Trump said he dissolved the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum \u201crather than putting pressure\u201d on its members, although both groups were preparing to disband on their own when Trump made his announcement on Twitter. The snubs from chief executives raised questions about Trump\u2019s ability to marshal the business community behind his policy goals. A Wall Street analyst, Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said that because the infrastructure panel had yet to get off the ground, its demise was less important than the scrapping of the other two groups. \u201cBut it contributes to the uncertainty that\u2019s creeping in\u201d about Trump\u2019s agenda, Hellwig said.

        "title": "Trump signs order aimed at upgrading government cyber defenses",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to bolster the government\u2019s cyber security and protect critical infrastructure from cyber attacks, marking his first significant action to address what he has called a top priority. The order seeks to improve the often-maligned network security of U.S. government agencies, from which foreign governments and other hackers have pilfered millions of personal records and other forms of sensitive data in recent years. The White House said the order also aimed to enhance protection of infrastructure such as the energy grid and financial sector from sophisticated attacks that officials have warned could pose a national security threat or cripple parts of the economy. The directive, which drew largely favorable reviews from cyber experts and industry groups, also lays out goals to develop a more robust cyber deterrence strategy, in part by forging strong cooperation with U.S. allies in cyberspace. White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said the order sought to build on efforts undertaken by the former Obama administration.  Among the notable changes, heads of federal agencies must use a framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to assess and manage cyber risk, and prepare a report within 90 days documenting how they will implement it. The Obama administration had encouraged the private sector to adopt the voluntary NIST framework. But it did not require government agencies to do so, which opened it up to criticism as it frequently scrambled to respond to major hacks, such as the theft of more than 20 million personnel records from the Office of Personnel Management. Government agencies would now \u201cpractice what they preach,\u201d Bossert told reporters during a White House briefing. \u201cA lot of progress was made in the last administration, but not nearly enough.\u201d Michael Daniel, who served as White House cyber security coordinator under former Democratic President Barack Obama, generally praised the order but said it was largely \u201ca plan for a plan.\u201d Trump, a Republican, has also asked agencies to review their federal workforce\u2019s cyber talent, an area where the government has faced a growing shortfall of qualified personnel in recent years. The order calls for an examination of the impact of moving agencies toward a shared information technology environment, such as through cloud computing services. It also urges voluntary cooperation with the private sector to develop better strategies to fend off and reduce attacks from botnets, or  networks of infected devices. Trump nearly signed a cyber security measure just days into his presidency in January, but it was pulled back to allow for more input from federal agencies and consultation with experts. Before taking office, Trump said he intended to make cyber security a priority of his administration. But he has raised alarm among cyber security experts by frequently using a personal Twitter that could be hacked by an adversary. His skepticism of the conclusion by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia hacked Democratic emails during the election to help him win has drawn criticism. Russia has repeatedly denied assertions it used cyber means to meddle in the U.S. election. Bossert said Russia\u2019s alleged hacks were not a motivation for the order, adding that \u201cthe Russians are not our only adversary on the internet.\u201d ",

        "title": "Japan's Abe to push pacifist constitution reform after strong election win",
        "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, buoyed by a huge election win for lawmakers who favor revising Japan s post-war, pacifist constitution, signaled a push towards his long-held goal on Monday but will need to convince a divided public to succeed. Parties in favor of amending the U.S.-drafted charter won nearly 80 percent of the seats in Sunday s lower house election, media counts showed. That left the small, new Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) as the biggest group opposed to Abe s proposed changes. Formed by liberal members of the Democratic Party, which imploded before the election and no longer exists in the lower house, the CDPJ won 55 seats, a final count by public broadcaster NHK shows. That is a fraction of the ruling bloc s two-thirds majority of 313 seats in the 465-member chamber. Abe said he wanted to get other parties on board, including Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike s new conservative Party of Hope, and was not insisting on a target of changing the constitution by 2020 that he floated this year.  We won a two-thirds majority as the ruling bloc, but it is necessary to strive to form a wide-ranging agreement among the ruling bloc and opposition (to revise the constitution),  Abe told a news conference on Monday.  And then we aim to win the understanding of the people, so that we can gain a majority in a referendum,  Abe said. He stopped short of claiming to have won a mandate for amending the constitution in Sunday s election. Amending the charter s pacifist Article 9 would be hugely symbolic for Japan. Supporters see it as the foundation of post-war democracy but many conservatives view it as a humiliating imposition after Japan s defeat in 1945. It would also be a victory for Abe, whose conservative agenda of restoring traditional values, stressing obligations to the state over individual rights and loosening constraints on the military, centers on revising the constitution.  Mr. Abe is trying to create a legacy. His first legacy project was to get the economy out of deflation,  said Jesper Koll, head of equities fund WisdomTree Japan.  The second legacy is to change the constitution,  he said.  You can debate whether he has a mandate but what will make or break him ... is the constitutional issue.  Any revision of the constitution requires support from two-thirds of the members of both chambers of parliament and a majority in a public referendum, with no minimum quorum.  I think that debate in parliament will begin,  said Zentaro Kamei, a senior researcher at think tank PHP Institute and a former lawmaker of Abe s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).   But the reason given for this snap election was Abe s proposal to change what sales tax hike revenues would be used for. If he starts talking about the constitution, people will say,  You didn t ask me that ,  Kamei said. Abe proposed last May adding a clause to Article 9 to legitimize Japan s Self-Defence Force. Read literally, Article 9 bans a standing military but has been interpreted to allow armed forces exclusively for self defense. Parliament enacted laws in 2015 allowing Japan to exercise collective self-defense, or aid allies under attack, based on a reinterpretation of the constitution rather than a formal revision. Critics, including CDPJ leader Yukio Edano, say those laws violate the constitution. The LDP s junior partner, the Komeito, is cautious about revising Article 9, perhaps even more so after signs that some of its dovish supporters had voted for the CDPJ. It also believes the biggest opposition party should agree with the proposed changes. Opinion polls show the public is divided on Abe s proposal. An NHK survey before the election showed 32 percent in favor, 21 percent opposed, and 39 percent unsure. Media exit polls showed that, despite the LDP s big win, 51 percent of voters do not trust the prime minister, a hangover from suspected cronyism scandals that eroded his support this year and a potential risk in case of a referendum.

        "title": "Make Hillary Likable Again: Democrats seek to recast Clinton",
        "text": "PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - When Hillary Clinton first ran for president in 2008 she was badly stung by a backhanded compliment from rival Barack Obama, who called her \u201clikable enough\u201d before going on to win the Democratic nomination and the White House. Eight years later, with her party\u2019s nomination to succeed Obama firmly in hand, the question of her likability, trustworthiness and honesty still hangs over her bid to become America\u2019s first woman president, this time in a Nov. 8 election against Republican Donald Trump. The Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this week is, in part, an effort to reintroduce her to American voters, more than half of whom view her unfavorably, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. The criticisms have dogged her for years: She can appear stiff in front of crowds, struggling to show off the compassion her supporters say she shares in private and leaving some voters with the impression she is not giving straight answers to tough questions. Clinton recognizes the problem, aides say. \u201cShe knows that she has work to do to earn people\u2019s trust,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton\u2019s communications director. \u201cShe also realizes there aren\u2019t some magic words you can say to earn that trust overnight.\u201d Speaker after speaker at the convention took the stage on Monday and Tuesday to offer testimonials on her behalf, including her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who filled his prime-time speech on Tuesday with anecdotes and private moments shared by America\u2019s best-known political couple. Gay basketball player Jason Collins told of the support she offered when he went public with his homosexuality; a grandmother described how her daughter\u2019s battle with drug addiction inspired Clinton to address the drug crisis. A parade of others offered behind-the-scenes glimpses of the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state, describing how she drove through a blizzard to attend a funeral, planned birthday parties and visited survivors of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.  Clinton\u2019s personal image, which has fluctuated during her 25 years in the public eye, slumped after a divisive Democratic primary, a lingering controversy over her use of a private email system while serving as the top U.S. diplomat, and repeated Republican attacks on \u201ccrooked Hillary.\u201d Reuters/Ipsos polling showed 55 percent of Americans had an unfavorable view of Clinton. Trump is even less popular, with 61 percent holding an unfavorable view. Many Americans think both candidates struggle with the truth. Some 59 percent of Americans believe she is not \u201chonest and truthful,\u201d while 53 percent think the same of Trump, according to the poll. Republican strategist John Feehery said it was too late to rehabilitate Clinton\u2019s image. \u201cYou only get one decade to make a first impression,\u201d he said.  Instead, a  better strategy would be to focus on tearing down Trump, given that his negatives surpass her own, Feehery added. Clinton\u2019s campaign appears to be trying just that, running an ad in which Trump can be seen in newsclips, as children watch, swearing, condemning Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers, and mocking a disabled journalist. Clinton, 68, has been a lightning rod for conservative attacks for more than two decades and Republicans serenaded speakers at their convention in Cleveland last week with chants of \u201cLock Her Up\u201d and signs touting \u201cHillary for Prison.\u201d  For many Democrats who back Clinton, the poor polling numbers are the result of those relentless attacks - along with a strong dose of sexism toward a woman seeking power. \u201cIf you have somebody who is out there pounding you and pounding you and pounding you, eventually it\u2019s going to take a toll,\u201d Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO labor federation, said. \u201cI\u2019ve said this and I\u2019ve said it publicly: Hillary Clinton has to do A+ work to get a C-.\u201d For Democrats, this week affords perhaps their best chance before the election to fortify her against inevitable attacks by Trump that could further dent her image. Praise came from invitees ranging from party superstars (First Lady Michelle Obama) to unknowns (former White House interns).    In one video broadcast to delegates, Clinton embraces and comforts an 11-year-old girl who fears her parents will be deported. In another, shown before the appearance of the Mothers of the Movement - mothers who lost children to gun violence or in police-involved incidents - she encourages them in a private meeting to band together and speak out. \u201cA 30-minute meeting turned into two hours because she listened to us. Nobody else listened to us,\u201d said Sybrina Fulton, mother of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old whose fatal shooting death by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012 launched a series of protests around the country. Actress Eva Longoria said it was time for Democrats to rally to Clinton\u2019s defense. \u201cShe\u2019s had a 25-year smear campaign run against her. It\u2019s understandable Americans are confused about what is true and what is not,\u201d she told a women\u2019s delegate caucus on Tuesday. ",

        "title": "U.S. senators seek ban on pesticide chlorpyrifos",
        "text": " (This version of the July 25 story corrects paragraph 11 to show that bill calls for banning chlorpyrifos and reviewing other similar pesticides, not reviewing effects of chlorpyrifos) By Emily Flitter NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of Democratic senators hopes to ban a pesticide the U.S. government has greenlighted for use, according to a bill unveiled on Tuesday in a challenge to Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s push to loosen environmental regulations.  The bill, introduced by Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico, would outlaw chlorpyrifos, an agricultural insect-killer that has been found to cause brain damage in children. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency denied a petition to ban the chemical on March 29, and a federal appeals court on July 18 denied a petition by green groups to force the agency to reverse its decision and enact the ban. The bill is called the Protect Children, Farmers and Farmworkers from Nerve Agent Pesticides Act of 2017. Seven other senators are co-sponsoring it: Ben Cardin of Maryland, Kamala Harris of California, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Richard Durbin of Illinois and Ed Markey of Massachusetts.  Chlorpyrifos, produced by a variety of manufacturers, including a subsidiary of Dow Chemical, is listed as a neurotoxin by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. \u201cCurrent regulatory safety standard for chlorpyrifos rests on five decades of experience in use, health surveillance of manufacturing workers and applicators, and more than 4,000 studies and reports examining the product in terms of health, safety and the environment,\u201d a Dow spokesman said on Tuesday. \u201cAuthorized uses of chlorpyrifos products, when used as directed, offer wide margins of protection for human health and safety.\u201d   The EPA considered whether to ban it for roughly a decade before Trump appointed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a Republican from Oklahoma, to lead the agency. In denying the petition to ban chlorpyrifos, Pruitt said the EPA had previously relied on \u201cnovel and uncertain\u201d scientific study methods to conclude the substance was dangerous. The agency said it was still reviewing the chemical\u2019s registration.  \u201cEPA will continue to evaluate the potential risks posed by chlorpyrifos as part of the ongoing registration review,\u201d said EPA spokeswoman Amy Graham. Trump and Pruitt have vowed to roll back environmental regulations they say are harming business growth in the United States.  Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician who is dean for global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said three long-term, independently funded studies showed the substance was toxic. \u201cChlorpyrifos has been shown beyond any shadow of a doubt to damage the brains of children, especially those of fetuses in the womb,\u201d he said. Udall\u2019s bill also calls for the EPA to conduct a broad review of the use of other pesticides similar to chlorpyrifos to determine which groups are most vulnerable to their harmful effects. If the review shows any people are being exposed to harmful levels of the chemicals, called organophosphates, the EPA administrator must take \u201cappropriate regulatory action\u201d within three months by either suspending or revoking the their registration or lowering the amount that can legally be used.  \u201cCongress must act because Administrator Pruitt has shown that he won\u2019t,\u201d Udall said in a statement on Monday.

        "title": "Srebrenica's Muslim defender cleared of crimes, Serbs protest",
        "text": "SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Naser Oric, the Bosnian Muslim commander who led the defense of Srebrenica during the 1992-95 war, was cleared of war crimes against Serbs on Monday, a ruling greeted by both celebration and condemnation in the divided state. Bosnian Muslims, who largely see Oric as a hero, broke into applause as he and a fellow soldier left the courtroom free men. Cheering crowds massed around them outside.  Families of Bosnian Serbs killed in the war, who see Oric and his troops as criminals, walked out of the hearing in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo in protest.  This is horrific, this is a scandal. Everybody expected that he will be punished. Is this a justice? I am speechless,  said Radojka Filipovic from Bratunac, near Srebrenica. She said Oric s forces killed at least six of her relatives. Milorad Dodik, the president of Bosnia s autonomous Serb Republic, called on Serb lawyers to withdraw from the shared national legal system. The justice minister of neighboring Serbia, Nela Kuburovic, called the ruling  shameful . The case went to the heart of fractured Bosnia, haunted by ethnic divides and long-running grievances that have blocked its progress to joining the European Union and NATO. Bosnia was hit by a devastating war in the 1990s after the Bosnian Serbs, helped by Serbia, tried to carve out a separate statelet following the break up of Yugoslavia. Bosnian Serbs have accused Oric and his men of killing about 3,000 of their people in the Srebrenica area during the conflict.  Bosnian Muslims, or Bosniaks, hailed his role in defending Srebrenica, where Bosnian Serb forces later killed more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys - widely seen as Europe s worst atrocity since World War Two. After the war, the country was divided into two autonomous regions, the Serb Republic and the Bosniak-Croat Federation, linked via a weak central government.  Serbs cannot accept this and this proves this country and its judiciary should not exist,  Serb Republic President Dodik said in the town of Banja Luka after the verdict.  I call on all Serbs in the court and prosecution to pull out from these institutions.   Dodik has long disputed the authority of the national legal system, which he says was established on the order of Bosnia s Western peace envoys, and has repeatedly threatened to secede if his region s autonomy is undermined.     Dodik said the verdict would likely  revive the idea of holding a referendum on the state court  - the last attempt to hold a referendum on the status of the state court, in 2015, was halted amid Western warnings. Bosnia s three-man presidency chairman Dragan Covic, a Bosnian Croat, said negative rhetoric over the case could be a setback for Bosnia s progress. Oric was acquitted of war crimes against Serbs by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 2008, but was arrested again in June 2015 in Switzerland on a warrant from Serbia accusing him of killing three Bosnian Serb prisoners of war early in the conflict.  It was only just to acquit Oric of war crimes charges,  Hatidza Mehmedovic, a Bosnian Muslim who lost her husband and two sons in the Srebrenica massacre, told the Fena news agency.  It was a great injustice to drag him in courts from The Hague to here.  Oric did not speak to reporters outside the court. Dozens of Bosnian Serbs, including senior political and military leaders, have been sentenced by the ICTY and a Bosnian war crimes court over the Srebrenica massacre, which was declared genocide by two international courts. Millions of people were displaced and more than 100,000 died in the war. ",

        "title": "Republicans act to curb U.S. regulation; Democrats poised for fight",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans lawmakers on Thursday pressed ahead in trying to strip down U.S. regulations, with the House of Representatives passing a bill that requires Congressional approval of major rulemakings that could affect areas ranging from the environment to education. The House voted 237 to 187 on legislation known as the \u201cREINS Act\u201d that is intended to keep agencies from pumping out new rules.  \u201cExcessive regulation means higher prices, lower wages, fewer jobs, less economic growth and a less competitive America,\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said before the vote, echoing the anti-regulation sentiment popular in his party. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to roll back regulation, saying it would boost economic growth. The Judiciary Committee\u2019s senior Democrat, John Conyers, called the REINS Act \u201cgumming-the-works legislation\u201d that imposes unworkable deadlines and prescribes convoluted procedures in order to \u201cend rulemaking as we know it.\u201d \u201cWithout question, it was the lack of regulatory controls that facilitated rampant predatory lending, which nearly destroyed our nation\u2019s economy,\u201d Conyers said, referring to the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession. \u201cIt led to millions of home foreclosures and devastated neighborhoods across America.\u00a0In fact, it nearly caused a global economic meltdown.\u201d\u00a0  On Wednesday, the House passed a bill giving Congress the power to kill dozens of new rules at once. On Thursday Republican Senator Ron Johnson introduced an identical companion bill in the Senate. The legislation would allow lawmakers to bundle a variety of rules finalized since May together for a single vote of disapproval. Under a law known as the Congressional Review Act, Congress currently can only vote to void rules one-by-one. That could take days, given the high number of recently enacted rules that rankle Republicans on energy, the environment, transportation, finance, education and communications. Disapproval votes require simple majorities to pass. Senate Democrats, however, are poised to block Johnson\u2019s bill and most other anti-regulation legislation. Many in the party believe regulations benefit and protect individuals. While Republicans control Congress, and in a couple of weeks will take over the White House, Democrats can cripple their efforts through Senate filibusters and possibly start a protracted fight over regulations. \u201cThis legislation would make the process much quicker, but I\u2019m committed to working as long as we need to in order to take advantage of the Congressional Review Act,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe ought to work 24-7 if necessary to bring regulatory relief to American consumers and businesses.\u201d ",

        "title": "Trump scrambles to find top national security aide",
        "text": "NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, scrambling to find a new top security aide after firing his first one and being spurned by another candidate, said on Friday he has four people under consideration including acting national security adviser Keith Kellogg. Trump ousted Michael Flynn on Monday in a controversy over the retired lieutenant general\u2019s contacts with Russia. Retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward on Thursday turned down the Republican president\u2019s offer to replace Flynn. \u201cGeneral Keith Kellogg, who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA - as are three others,\u201d Trump said on Twitter, without naming the other candidates. Former CIA chief David Petraeus was previously identified as a candidate by a White House official. Former U.S. National Security Agency head Keith Alexander and former supreme allied commander in Europe James Jones, who held the national security adviser post under former Democratic President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2010, were also thought to be under consideration. Both are retired generals. Two others also thought to be in contention were former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton and Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, who holds a senior post with the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general who is currently chief of staff of the White House National Security Council, accompanied Trump on a trip to South Carolina on Friday before heading to Florida. He stepped into the national security adviser role on an acting basis after Flynn\u2019s firing. Trump may meet with candidates for the post during his weekend visit to Florida, a White House official told reporters. Petraeus held command posts in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and served as CIA director under Obama. He quit as CIA chief in 2012 and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified materials relating to documents he had given his biographer, with whom he had an affair. Harward, a senior executive at Lockheed Martin and former Navy SEAL, declined Trump\u2019s offer in part because he wanted to bring in his own team, according to two sources familiar with Harward\u2019s decision. The White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, told Fox News on Friday that Harward\u2019s family \u201cdidn\u2019t sign off\u201d on him taking the job. \u201cThat\u2019s all it is,\u201d Priebus said. Richard Haass, who held senior White House and State Department posts under Republican presidents and now heads the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Twitter the new national security advisor should insist on the right to choose staff members and have unlimited access to the president. Haass, who Trump considered for a job in his administration, also called for rescinding a directive from the president that gave Trump\u2019s chief White House strategist, Steve Bannon, a seat on the National Security Council, a move condemned by Democrats. Trump\u2019s administration has been dealing with the fallout from Flynn\u2019s departure for much of the week. Flynn, a close adviser to Trump during his presidential campaign last year, was seen by Moscow as a leading advocate of friendlier ties with Russia. Trump said on Thursday he fired Flynn because he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States, before Trump took office, about sanctions imposed by Obama\u2019s administration. Trump has defended Flynn\u2019s actual contact with the ambassador, saying what he did \u201cwasn\u2019t wrong.\u201d The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Flynn told FBI agents last month that he had not discussed sanctions with the ambassador. Flynn\u2019s Jan. 24 interview with the FBI could expose him to charges, since lying to the agency is a felony, but any decision to prosecute would lie with the Justice Department. ",

        "title": "In demanding Hariri's return, Lebanese find rare unity",
        "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - A country long divided by sectarian conflicts, Lebanon has found a rare point of unity since Saad al-Hariri s shock resignation as prime minister: Lebanese of all stripes want him to come back from Saudi Arabia and to continue his work as premier. Hariri left Beirut for Riyadh on Nov. 3 and resigned the following day in a speech that caught even his closest aides off guard. He cited fear of assassination and blamed Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah for sowing strife in the Arab world. The Lebanese authorities believe Saudi Arabia forced Hariri to resign and is holding him against his will, say top Lebanese state officials and politicians close to Hariri. While some in Lebanon believe Hariri s decision was his own and blame Iran and Hezbollah for the crisis, many others, including some of his longtime supporters, think he was forced to quit. Billboards and posters demanding his return have gone up across Beirut.  We want our PM back,  declared a huge billboard near the Beirut waterfront. Runners in the annual Beirut marathon on Sunday echoed the demand. Some wore T-shirts printed with Hariri s face and the message:  We re all waiting for you.   This year, there are definitely many telling him  we are waiting for you , and God willing he will come back safe and sound,  May al-Khalil, the founder and president of the Beirut Marathon Association, said. Hariri ran in the Beirut marathon last year, shortly after he was installed as prime minister of a coalition government that generated hope of stability after years of political tension and paralysis.     Thousands of runners turned out, defying security concerns that have grown since Hariri resigned and Saudi Arabia declared both Lebanon and Hezbollah as hostile parties.  Sheikh Saad al-Hariri represents all Lebanese people,  said Beirut Mayor Jamal Itani, wearing a cap that read  Running for You . Lebanese wanted Hariri  to return as Prime Minister , he said. Saudi Arabia has denied reports Hariri, a long time ally of Riyadh, is being held against his will and coerced into resigning. It says he is a free man and quit because Hezbollah was calling the shots in his government. Ashraf Rifi, a hawkish Sunni politician who is fiercely critical of Hezbollah and Iran, has welcomed Hariri s resignation, saying  it pulled the official cover away from Iran s project in Lebanon .  Tension between Hariri and Hezbollah has been a defining feature of Lebanese politics since the 2005 assassination of his father, Rafik al-Hariri. A U.N.-backed tribunal has charged five Hezbollah members over the killing. Hezbollah denies any role. But Hariri has twice set aside his differences with Hezbollah to lead coalition governments including the group.   We all love him, even those who weren t sympathetic to him are now sympathetic, because as you know he s the prime minister of all of Lebanon, not just prime minister for us Sunnis,  said Yousef Saad al-Deen, 40.  No one is allowed to decide for us, neither who our president is nor who we will elect,  he added, speaking in the staunchly pro-Hariri Beirut neighborhood of Tariq al-Jdideh, where newly erected posters pledged loyalty to Hariri. Munir Khatib, a man in his late 60s, said Iran was to blame.  He is not being held, as they are saying,  he said.  Hezbollah, the strongest group in Lebanon thanks to its vast arsenal, has declared Saudi Arabia s detention of Hariri as an insult to all Lebanese. At a rally on Friday, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said he must return. The Future Movement, Hariri s political party, also says Hariri must come back to Lebanon, calling him a national leader whose presence is vital to upholding the Lebanese system. It has also taken aim at criticism of Saudi Arabia, on Saturday rejecting  campaigns targeting  the Kingdom. Lebanon, which fought a civil war from 1975-90, is governed according to a carefully balanced system that parcels out the state along sectarian lines. Many say now is the time for unity.  The war had taught us that if we don t have our ranks united and on the same ground, the country cannot succeed,  said Arlette Dakkash, a resident of Beirut. ",

        "title": "Trump pleads with Republicans to roll back Obamacare",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump made a last-ditch plea to U.S. Senate Republicans on Monday to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and fulfill seven years of campaign promises to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law. The Senate will vote on Tuesday on whether to open debate on an overhaul of the law, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promising an open amendment process and a \u201crobust\u201d debate. \u201cTo every member of the Senate I say this: The American people have waited long enough. There\u2019s been enough talk, and no action. Now is the time for action,\u201d Trump said on Monday at the White House. Standing in front of families who he said had been hurt by the law popularly known as Obamacare, Trump said, \u201cSo far, Senate Republicans have not done their job in ending the Obamacare nightmare.\u201d Even as it remained unclear on Monday whether McConnell had enough votes in the Senate to open debate, he said the vote would take place regardless. \u201cI know many of us have waited years for this\u00a0moment to finally arrive. And, at long last, it finally has. I would urge every colleague to join me,\u201d McConnell said. Senator John McCain, who has been battling brain cancer in his home state of Arizona, is expected to return to the Senate to cast a vote, his office said on Monday.      Moderate Senator Susan Collins, who has vocally opposed McConnell\u2019s efforts so far, said on Monday she would vote \u201cno\u201d on a motion to proceed.  Republicans have been under heavy political pressure to make good on their longstanding campaign promises to gut the 2010 law, which they view as a government intrusion in the healthcare market. But the party is deeply divided between moderates concerned the Senate bill would eliminate insurance for millions of low-income Americans and conservatives who want to see even deeper cuts to the Obamacare legislation. Senate Republicans have been unable to reach consensus on an approach, with McConnell failing to secure enough votes for either a repeal and replacement of Obamacare or a straight repeal. Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the 100-member Senate. With Democrats united in opposition, McConnell can only afford to lose two Republican votes.  \u201cThe question for every senator, Democrat or Republican, is whether they will side with Obamacare\u2019s architects, which have been so destructive to our country, or its forgotten victims?\u201d Trump said. While Trump has repeatedly called on Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare, he has shown little interest in the policy specifics. Trump last week initially suggested he was fine with letting Obamacare collapse, then urged Republican senators to hash out a deal. His remarks on Monday were among the lengthiest statements he has made regarding healthcare. \u201cObamacare is death. That\u2019s the one that\u2019s death,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd besides that, it\u2019s failing so you won\u2019t have it anyway.\u201d McConnell will ask senators whether to begin debate on the healthcare bill passed in May by the House of Representatives. If that procedural vote succeeds, the House bill would then be open for amendment on the Senate floor. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the Senate\u2019s replacement bill could lead to as many as 22 million fewer Americans being insured. A plan to repeal Obamacare without replacing it could cost 32 million Americans their health insurance by 2026, CBO estimated. At the same time, premiums on individual insurance plans would rise 25 percent next year and double by 2026 if Obamacare is repealed, CBO said. Uncertainty over the future of healthcare has left health insurance companies and U.S. states as well as hospitals and doctors unclear about future funding and coverage. Public opinion polls also show Americans worried about potential changes to the healthcare system.       ",

        "title": "Rohingya Muslims flee as more than 2,600 houses burned in Myanmar's Rakhine",
        "text": "COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - More than 2,600 houses have been burned down in Rohingya-majority areas of Myanmar s northwest in the last week, the government said on Saturday, in one of the deadliest bouts of violence involving the Muslim minority in decades. About 58,600 Rohingya have fled into neighbouring Bangladesh from Myanmar, according to U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, as aid workers there struggle to cope. Myanmar officials blamed the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) for the burning of the homes. The group claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks on security posts last week that prompted clashes and a large army counter-offensive.  But Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh say a campaign of arson and killings by the Myanmar army is aimed at trying to force them out. The treatment of Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi, accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the Muslim minority that has long complained of persecution. Former colonial power Britain said on Saturday it hoped Suu Kyi would use her  remarkable qualities  to end the violence.  Aung San Suu Kyi is rightly regarded as one of the most inspiring figures of our age, but the treatment of the Rohingya is, alas, besmirching the reputation of Burma,  foreign minister Boris Johnson said in a statement. The clashes and army crackdown have killed nearly 400 people and more than 11,700  ethnic residents  have been evacuated from the area, the government said, referring to the non-Muslim residents. It marks a dramatic escalation of a conflict that has simmered since October, when a smaller Rohingya attack on security posts prompted a military response dogged by allegations of rights abuses.  A total of 2,625 houses from Kotankauk, Myinlut and Kyikanpyin villages and two wards in Maungtaw were burned down by the ARSA extremist terrorists,  the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar said. The group has been declared a terrorist organisation by the government.  But Human Rights Watch, which analysed satellite imagery and accounts from Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, said the Myanmar security forces deliberately set the fires. New satellite imagery shows the total destruction of a Muslim village, and prompts serious concerns that the level of devastation in northern Rakhine state may be far worse than originally thought,  said the group s deputy Asia director, Phil Robertson. Near the Naf river separating Myanmar and Bangladesh, new arrivals in Bangladesh carrying their belongings in sacks set up crude tents or tried to squeeze into available shelters or homes of locals.   The existing camps are near full capacity and numbers are swelling fast. In the coming days there needs to be more space,  said UNHCR regional spokeswoman Vivian Tan, adding more refugees were expected.  The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar and regarded as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots that date back centuries. Bangladesh is also growing increasingly hostile to Rohingya, more than 400,000 of whom live in the poor South Asian country after fleeing Myanmar since the early 1990s. Jalal Ahmed, 60, who arrived in Bangladesh on Friday with a group of about 3,000 after walking from Kyikanpyin for almost a week, said he believed the Rohingya were being pushed out of Myanmar.   The military came with 200 people to the village and started fires...All the houses in my village are already destroyed. If we go back there and the army sees us, they will shoot,  he said.  Reuters could not independently verify these accounts as access for independent journalists to northern Rakhine has been restricted since security forces locked down the area in October. Speaking to soldiers, government staff and Rakhine Buddhists affected by the conflict on Friday, army chief Min Aung Hlaing said there is no  oppression or intimidation  against the Muslim minority and  everything is within the framework of the law .  The Bengali problem was a long-standing one which has become an unfinished job,  he said, using a term used by many in Myanmar to refer to the Rohingya that suggests they come from Bangladesh.  Many aid programmes running in northern Rakhine prior to the outbreak of violence, including life-saving food assistance by the World Food Programme (WFP), have been suspended since the fighting broke out.  Food security indicators and child malnutrition rates in Maungdaw were already above emergency thresholds before the violence broke out, and it is likely that they will now deteriorate even further,  said Pierre Peron, spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Myanmar. More than 80,000 children may need treatment for malnutrition in northern Rakhine and many of them reported  extreme  food insecurity, WFP said in July. In Bangladesh, Tan of UNHCR said more shelters and medical care were needed.  There s a lot of pregnant women and lactating mothers and really young children, some of them born during the flight. They all need medical attention,  she said. Among new arrivals, 22-year-old Tahara Begum gave birth to her second child in a forest on the way to Bangladesh.   It was the hardest thing I ve ever done,  she said.  ",

        "text": "KABUL (Reuters) - Gunmen disguised as police killed a security guard and opened fire on staff at a private television station in the Afghan capital Kabul on Tuesday and Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. After a sporadic gun battle lasting about two hours, Afghan special forces suppressed the attack on Shamshad TV, a private Pashto-language broadcaster based close to the national stadium. Police said at least two people were killed and 20 wounded.  People dressed in police clothes came in and initially threw hand grenades, which killed one of our guards and wounded another,  Abed Ehsas, Shamshad s news director told broadcaster Tolo News TV.  Others got into our building and started firing. Some of our colleagues were hit, though, thank God, many others managed to get out. Some were wounded by gunshots, falling glass and when they jumped from higher floors.  Some two hours later the station, which had replaced regular programs with a still picture as the fighting went on, resumed normal service, its newsreader appearing with a bandage on a hand injured in the attack.. The attack, which underlined insecurity in Kabul, came on the day NATO announced an increase of some 3,000 troops in its Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan as part of a bid to break the stalemate with Taliban insurgents. Amid the crack of gunfire, a special forces unit blasted a hole in the concrete wall around the compound and entered the site as police blocked off surrounding streets. At least one attacker was killed during the operation, while another died at the compound entrance. In a statement on its news agency Amaq, Islamic State claimed responsibility, without giving evidence. The group, based mainly in the eastern province of Nangarhar, has claimed a number of attacks on civilian targets in Kabul but uncertainty remains over whether all the attacks the group claims are actually its work. Shortly after the beginning of the attack, the Taliban s main spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, issued an immediate denial of involvement. Suicide bombings are part of life in Kabul but the latest attack on journalists and media workers was described by human rights group Amnesty International as an  horrific crime .  The Afghan authorities must do what they can to protect the country s media, allowing them to work freely and without fear,  the group said in a statement. Last year a Taliban suicide bomber killed seven members of Afghanistan s largest private television station, Tolo. In May, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on state broadcaster RTA in the eastern city of Jalalabad.. Tuesday s attack took place about three weeks after a series of attacks including one on a Shi ite mosque in the city in which more than 50 people were killed. ",

        "title": "Before Putin talks, Trump plays down interference in U.S. election",
        "text": "WARSAW (Reuters) - One day before his first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that no one knows for sure whether Moscow intervened in the 2016 U.S. election but that he suspected Russian involvement. Speaking to reporters in Poland, Trump played down the assessment of his own intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the election by hacking Democrats\u2019 emails and distributing online propaganda.     \u201cI think it was Russia, but I think it was probably other people and/or countries, and I see nothing wrong with that statement. Nobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure,\u201d Trump told a news conference.  Investigations by a special counsel, Robert Mueller, and several U.S. congressional committees are looking into whether Russia interfered in the election and colluded with Trump\u2019s campaign. Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscow\u2019s actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials say, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries.  Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Trump, who defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the November election, will meet Putin on Friday at a G20 summit in the German city of Hamburg for their first official encounter.  It was not clear whether the Republican president would bring up the issue of election interference when the two men meet.  In a speech in Warsaw, Trump affirmed U.S. commitment to the defense of NATO allies and gently criticized Russia. Trump frequently praised Putin as a strong leader during the election campaign and called for better U.S. relations with Moscow but he has since tempered that rhetoric. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives\u2019 Intelligence Committee, said Trump\u2019s remarks in Poland about the election only propagated \u201chis own personal fiction.\u201d      \u201cThe President\u2019s comments today, again casting doubt on whether Russia was behind the blatant interference in our election and suggesting \u2013 his own intelligence agencies to the contrary \u2013 that nobody really knows, continue to directly undermine U.S. interests,\u201d Schiff said in a statement.             Trump cast doubt at his news conference over media reports that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia had meddled in the election.     \u201cLet me just start off by saying I heard it was 17 agencies.  I said, boy, that\u2019s a lot, do we even have that many intelligence agencies, right?  Let\u2019s check it. And we did some very heavy research. It turned out to be three or four. It wasn\u2019t 17,\u201d Trump said.            The U.S. intelligence report in January accusing Russia of meddling in the U.S. election was issued by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the 17 U.S. intelligence agencies.  But the report acknowledges that it is based on an assessment by the CIA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency, which held the key classified information on Russian activities. Trump said the CIA told his predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama, last August about Russian interference in the election but he did nothing to stop it.     \u201cI think what happened is he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election, and he said let\u2019s not do anything about it. Had he thought the other way, he would have done something about it,\u201d Trump said. ",

        "title": "Protesters gather in Kiev after police recapture ex-Georgia leader Saakashvili",
        "text": "KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian police recaptured the former president of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili on Friday, prompting further protests in central Kiev by his supporters who freed him from police custody earlier this week. The development is the latest twist in a long feud between Ukrainian authorities and Saakashvili, who has turned on his one-time patron President Petro Poroshenko, accusing him of corruption and calling for his removal from office. General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko, who says Saakashvili is suspected of assisting a criminal organization, said the opposition leader had been detained by police and was in a temporary detention facility.  As promised, security officers did everything to avoid extreme violence and bloodshed,  he said in a post on Facebook. Saakashvili s recapture follows a surreal game of hide-and-seek that saw him clamber on a roof to avoid law enforcement, before being broken out of a police van by protesters amid clashes with hundreds of riot police on Tuesday. Ally and fellow Georgian, Davit Sakvarelidze, who was fired in March from his post as a senior prosecutor for Ukraine, called on Kiev residents to take to the streets to protest Saakashvili s recapture.  Today Poroshenko broke all records and went down in history as a dictator who does this to political opponents,  he told channel NewsOne near the detention centre in central Kiev. As of 2200 GMT, a few hundred protesters had gathered near the facility not far from the parliament, shouting  Shame!  and  Kiev, get up!  while a large number of police in riot gear stood guard. Saakashvili became a regional governor in Ukraine in 2015 at Poroshenko s invitation but they later fell out. Saakashvili denies the allegations against him. The saga threatens to embarrass the pro-Western authorities at a time when they face a chorus of criticism from reformers and foreign donors over perceived backtracking on reforms and attacks on anti-corruption institutions. On Friday, Poroshenko said the case against Saakashvili was legitimate and that he should cooperate with investigators.  If he flees from the investigation, this undermines his credibility,  he said. After escaping police custody, Saakashvili called for a rally against Poroshenko in Kiev to be held on Sunday, although he has kept a low profile in recent days after reportedly  catching a cold while sleeping in makeshift protest camp outside parliament. The politician s latest detention followed a failed attempt by police to recapture him in a raid on the camp on Wednesday, which led to violent clashes with protesters. While Saakashvili has a core base of supporters, he enjoys limited support across Ukraine. Only 1.7 percent of voters would support his party, the Movement of New Forces, in elections, according to an October survey by the Kiev-based Razumkov Centre think-tank. His backers see him as a fearless crusader against corruption but critics have said that there is little substance behind his rhetoric. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lobbyists and Republican lawmakers are gearing up for battle over a new U.S. regulation that is likely to dent profits in the $6 billion short-term, high-interest \u201cpayday\u201d loan industry.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is expected in coming days to release a long-anticipated rule curbing payday lending, now that a final review by other regulatory agencies has concluded, three people familiar with the matter said. The rule pits the country\u2019s consumer financial watchdog against payday lenders who say the new regulation will wipe out much of their established industry, currently overseen by the states, and push poor and rural customers to use illegal loan sharks.  \u201cWe are likely, on our part, to take the appropriate actions that we can to see this rule never becomes effective, and that includes a possible lawsuit,\u201d said Dennis Shaul, chief executive of the Community Financial Services Association of America (CFSA), a payday lending trade group. The group says the rule-drafting process was flawed because the agency did not listen to borrowers or properly process comment letters - an argument that could form the basis of potential litigation. The CFPB has declined to comment on its procedure or on the final rule, but public records show it closely followed the law throughout the rulemaking process. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump\u2019s Republican party, which says the CFPB goes too far in its regulations, wants to undo the rule through legislation. Recently, Republicans in the House of Representatives added a \u201crider,\u201d or amendment, to a spending bill banning the CFPB from regulating the payday loan industry. They are also poised to repeal the rule under the Congressional Review Act and bar the CFPB from ever drafting a similar regulation, according to aides and lobbyists. Borrowers take out the small, short-term loans to cover emergencies and traditionally repay them with their next paychecks. Because the loans can carry interest rates as high as 390 percent, borrowers can become trapped in devastating cycles of taking out new loans to pay outstanding ones, the CFPB said.  The agency began drafting the rule last summer to end this \u201cdebt trap,\u201d by requiring lenders to conduct background checks showing borrowers can afford the loans and to limit the number of loans made to a single borrower.  \u201cThe rule that we\u2019re expecting will do a lot to combat the debt cycle,\u201d said Karl Frisch, head of Allied Progress, a consumer advocacy group.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. senators on Wednesday delayed a committee vote on President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency after the panel\u2019s Democrats boycotted the meeting, saying that nominee Scott Pruitt doubts the science of climate change. The boycott in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee delayed the transition to a new administrator for the agency. Senator Ben Cardin, a Democrat, said he could not support Pruitt, a Republican and the attorney general of Oklahoma, for a public health position because he \u201cdenies the sum of empirical science and the urgency to act on climate change.\u201d At a committee confirmation hearing last month Pruitt, who has sued the agency he intends to run more than a dozen times on behalf of the oil-drilling state Oklahoma, expressed doubt about climate change science. But Pruitt said he would be would be obliged for now to uphold the agency\u2019s 2009 \u201cendangerment finding\u201d that carbon dioxide emissions harm public health. The finding is the agency\u2019s basis for regulations on those emissions.  Senator Tom Carper, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, said Pruitt had provided \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d answers to written questions and had not named one agency regulation that he supported. \u201cIf Mr. Pruitt is serious about leading this important agency, he should be more than willing to provide straightforward answers to our fundamental questions,\u201d Carper said. Republicans decried the move by the Democrats. \u201cThis is simply a senatorial temper tantrum,\u201d said Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska, another oil state. Trump, like Republican Senator Jim Inhofe on the panel, has called climate change a hoax. Trump has promised to make changes at the agency including doing away with previous President Barack Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan that cracks down on emissions from coal-fired electricity generators. The plan was suspended by the Supreme Court last year. John Konkus, a spokesman for Pruitt\u2019s confirmation team, said Democrats and the EPA under Obama had \u201cput politics and rhetoric ahead of their core work and ahead of the welfare of the American public.\u201d In 2013, Republican senators on the panel boycotted then- Obama\u2019s second term pick for the agency, Gina McCarthy, saying they were \u201ccompletely unsatisfied\u201d by her answers to more than 1,000 written questions they had asked her.

        "title": "No proof Russian hacking influenced U.S. election: Trump spokesman",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - No evidence has emerged to suggest Russian hacking influenced the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and it would be irresponsible to jump to conclusions before receiving a final intelligence report, Donald Trump\u2019s spokesman said on Monday. \u201cThere is zero evidence that they influenced the election,\u201d Sean Spicer told Fox News. Due to become White House press secretary when Trump enters the White House on Jan. 20, Spicer told CNN the president-elect would see the intelligence report once it was completed later this week. On Saturday, Trump warned against being quick to pin the blame on Russia for the hacking of U.S. emails. \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re jumping to conclusions before we have a final report is irresponsible,\u201d Spicer told CNN.     President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian suspected spies and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies last week for alleged Kremlin involvement in hacking that intelligence officials said aimed to help the Republican Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. Leading lawmakers from both parties have voiced alarm at the suggestion of Russian interference, whether or not it made a difference in the outcome. Republican John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has scheduled a Thursday hearing on foreign cyber threats. The new Congress, elected on Nov. 8, takes office on Tuesday. Calling for closer ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump has repeatedly played down the hacking affair. Over the weekend Trump said he knew \u201cthings that other people don\u2019t know\u201d and would disclose some information on the issue on Tuesday or Wednesday. He gave no further detail. \u201cHe\u2019s going to talk about his conclusions and where he thinks things stand,\u201d Spicer told CNN. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to reveal anything that was privileged or shared with him classified.\u201d  On Sunday Spicer said the White House may have disproportionately punished Russia.     \u201cIt\u2019s baffling,\u201d U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC on Monday. \u201cPresident-elect Trump does not have any better information than President Obama.\u201d A Gallup Poll released on Monday showed less than half of Americans were confident in Trump\u2019s ability to handle an international crisis, to use military force wisely or to prevent major scandals in his administration.  The poll said at least seven in 10 Americans were confident in presidents Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton in those areas before they took office. ",

        "title": "Connecticut governor vetoes budget as spending cuts loom",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy on Thursday vetoed the $40.7 billion biennial budget passed by lawmakers earlier this month, saying the bill would undermine the state\u2019s fiscal stability, education system and economic development. Malloy, a second-term Democrat who is not running for reelection, had said he would not approve the Republican-supported budget.  Without a budget, which is now nearly three months overdue, the state could implement severe cuts on Oct. 1 under an emergency spending plan put in place by Malloy. Republican lawmakers, who do not control the legislature but won support for their budget from a handful of Democrats, have said they may try to override the governor\u2019s veto, which was expected. As the state continues to wrangle over how to close a 2-year, $3.5 billion budget gap, some Connecticut cities are in the firing because of reduced state aid. Credit ratings agency S&P Global Ratings on Thursday put nine cities and a school district on alert for possible downgrades. The warning \u201creflects Connecticut\u2019s ongoing budget impasse and brinkmanship, which could reduce significant amounts of municipal aid payments to local governments,\u201d said S&P analyst Victor Medeiros. \u201cThe credit quality of these municipalities could deteriorate further due to weaker reserves and liquidity concerns.\u201d The cities - which include its largest, Bridgeport, and New Haven - are likely to dip into their reserves to offset losses in state aid. The drain on reserves would \u201cmake their financial position all the more precarious,\u201d Medeiros said. The capital city, Hartford, was not on the list but has been downgraded four times in the last few weeks. On Wednesday, it fell multiple notches deeper into junk territory as it faces a potential bankruptcy.     Under the Republican plan, Hartford would have lost $6.8 million dollars of state support \u201cat a time when its financial future is in peril, almost certainly forcing it into bankruptcy,\u201d Malloy said in his veto message. Malloy also took issue with proposals to cut state public pension benefits, which could lead to expensive court challenges from public employee unions, and an education funding plan that he said was inequitable. State Senate Republican President Pro Tempore Len Fasano said in a statement that the veto had \u201cput Connecticut in chaos.\u201d The veto means that cuts under Malloy\u2019s \u201cdraconian executive order will remain in effect and create destruction for low and middle income families\u201d unless lawmakers vote to override it, Fasano said.

        "text": "RIYADH (Reuters) - A large Saudi public university announced it would dismiss employees suspected of ties to the banned Muslim Brotherhood, adding to concerns that the government is clamping down on its critics in academia and beyond. Activists and rights groups say security forces have rounded up some 30 clerics, intellectuals and others in the past 10 days, in what Human Rights Watch has described as  a coordinated crackdown on dissent . Authorities have not explicitly acknowledged the detentions, which come amid widespread speculation - denied by officials - that King Salman will abdicate in favor of his son as well as deepening tensions with neighboring Qatar, which is accused by Riyadh of supporting Islamists, including the Brotherhood. The governing council of Al-Imam Mohammed Ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh advised against renewing contracts for employees it said were  influenced by the ideology of the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood organization . The statement, posted online on Tuesday, did not name the employees or specify their number, but said they included Saudis and foreigners. The employees  removal  aims to protect the minds of students and university employees from those deviant, partisan ideas and dangerous, destructive trends , it added. Saudi Arabia designated the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization in 2014. Hardline groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State are also blacklisted. The ruling Al Saud family has always regarded Islamist groups as a major internal threat to its rule over a country in which appeals to religious sentiment resonate deeply and an al Qaeda campaign a decade ago killed hundreds. Since the kingdom s founding, the Al Saud have enjoyed a close alliance with clerics of the ultra-conservative Wahhabi school of Islam who have espoused a political philosophy that demands obedience to the ruler. By contrast the Brotherhood advances an active political doctrine urging revolutionary action, which flies in the face of Wahhabi teaching.  A political Islamist organization founded in Egypt nearly a century ago, it says it is committed to peaceful activism and reform through elections, and its adherents span the region, holding elected office in Arab countries from Tunisia to Jordan. Brotherhood members fleeing repression in Egypt, Syria and Iraq half a century ago took shelter in Saudi Arabia, some taking up roles in the kingdom s education system and helping to establish the Sahwa or  Awakening  movement which agitated in the 1990s for democracy. The Sahwa mostly fizzled, with some activists arrested and others coaxed into conformity, though admirers and its appeal lingered. ",

        "title": "Kansas lawmakers to hash out fiscal 2017 budget fix",
        "text": "(Reuters) - A committee of Kansas lawmakers will be charged with reconciling differences in legislation passed to plug a $280 million hole in the state\u2019s fiscal 2017 budget after the Senate passed a revised version of a House-approved bill late on Thursday. Both versions would allow the state to borrow money from a long-term investment fund and delay a payment to the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System. But the monetary amounts and plans to repay the cash differ, J.G. Scott, assistant director for fiscal affairs at the Kansas Legislative Research Department, said on Friday. Tax cuts enacted in 2012 have gouged a hole in the Kansas budget as revenue failed to meet monthly estimates, although February marked a fourth straight month that collections met or exceeded projections. Kansas also faces higher education spending in the wake of a recent state supreme court ruling. Scott said the bills to fix the budget will head to a legislative conference committee probably next week. The Senate on Thursday rejected three attempts to amend the bill with across-the-board spending cuts of 2 percent, 1 percent and 0.5 percent. Republican Senate President Susan Wagle contended spending cuts, which would have included primary and secondary public schools, would ease tax hikes the legislature is expected to take up to tackle a $755 million projected budget shortfall over the next two fiscal years. A move in the state legislature last month to boost revenue by raising tax rates and eliminating a business exemption failed when the Senate was unable to override Republican Governor Sam Brownback\u2019s veto. Complicating Kansas\u2019 finances is a March 2 state supreme court ruling that found the school funding system falls short of a constitutional requirement for adequacy. The ruling, which set a June 30 deadline for the enactment of a constitutional funding method, could require Kansas to increase school funding by more than $500 million each year. Moody\u2019s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings have said the ruling will put increased pressure on the state\u2019s already shaky finances.  Meanwhile, resolutions are pending in the House and Senate to put a constitutional amendment on the November 2018 ballot that would require a two-thirds vote by both legislative chambers to pass any state tax increase. The measure also seeks an annual cap on state spending and creates funds for debt payments and a budget reserve. Scott said previous attempts to put similar measures on the ballot were not successful. ",

        "title": "France's Le Maire heads to Berlin to test Eurogroup waters",
        "text": "BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire will meet German officials in Berlin this week to discuss the future of the euro zone and assess his own prospects of becoming the next chairman of the Eurogroup forum of finance ministers. French and German officials confirmed Le Maire would be in Berlin on Wednesday, when he will meet acting Finance Minister Peter Altmaier, a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Le Maire is also due to see Christian Lindner, leader of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), and Cem Oezdemir, co-leader of the Greens party. Both are in discussions with Merkel s conservatives on forming a coalition government. France s Emmanuel Macron has made euro zone reform a central goal of his five-year presidency. But any changes will require the support of Merkel and her new government, which is not expected to be in place before Christmas. Lindner has been critical of Macron s idea to create a budget for the euro zone.   We want to follow up on the president s Sorbonne speech and exchange views on the future of the euro zone,  a French finance ministry official said, referring to a speech by Macron in September when he laid out his vision for EU reform. While Le Maire s visit - his first to Berlin since the German election - is about strengthening contacts with likely members of the new government, officials indicated that it would also be an opportunity to sound out Berlin on the Eurogroup presidency, a powerful position that will be elected next month. Since it was created in 2005, the Eurogroup, which brings together the euro zone s 19 finance ministers, has had only two presidents: Luxembourg s Jean-Claude Juncker, who served from 2005 to 2013, and former Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is due to step down in January. The position involves chairing monthly meetings and driving policy around economic and monetary union, including ensuring that all member states stick to strict targets on deficits and debt. The post has been dubbed  Mr Euro . Le Maire, 48, is regarded as sharp, ambitious and more than capable of leading the group. But some euro zone officials are wary about the presidency ending up in the hands of either Germany or France, the two largest economies in the single currency bloc and already dominant forces in policymaking. A further complication for Le Maire is France s poor record of meeting its own deficit targets over the past decade. German officials are not ruling out Le Maire, but they have also expressed a preference for giving the post to a smaller country. Last week, one official in Berlin mentioned two possible alternatives: Pierre Gramegna of Luxembourg and Peter Kazimir of Slovakia. The official also floated the idea of extending Dijsselbloem, seen as a close ally of Berlin, even though he is not part of the new Dutch government.  It is still quite unclear who will come forward,  the German official said when asked about the presidency.  At this stage there does not seem to be one candidate everyone is rallying behind. There is no natural candidate.  The Eurogroup president will be chosen on Dec. 4, an EU official said last week, with the formal call for candidates opening in mid-November.  It is not a done thing,  the German official said of Le Maire s candidacy.  He will only apply if he gets the impression that he is the one.     The talks in Berlin on Wednesday could be decisive in determining whether he does throw his hat into the ring. If Le Maire were to get the job, it could have repercussions for other top euro zone jobs. Mario Draghi will end his term as president of the European Central Bank on Oct. 31, 2019, and Germany s Jens Weidmann is already being mentioned as a potential successor. Euro zone watchers say that if the French secure the presidency of the Eurogroup, it may be harder for them to argue against a German candidate taking over the ECB. Still, as one senior French official told Reuters on condition of anonymity last month, Weidmann at the helm of the ECB  would be a problem for a lot of countries, not just for France . ",

        "title": "U.S. Congress passes legislation to protect firms' trade secrets",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress on Wednesday passed and sent to President Barack Obama legislation strengthening legal protection for companies\u2019 trade secrets, including manufacturing processes and computer methods. The House of Representatives voted 410-2 to approve the \u201cDefend Trade Secrets Act\u201d on the heels of it being unanimously passed by the Senate earlier this month. The legislation, which is backed by the White House, would open the door for companies to sue in federal court for damages related to theft of trade secrets. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said the measure \u201cwill help American innovators protect their intellectual property from criminal theft by foreign agents and those engaging in economic espionage.\u201d In urging its passage, Goodlatte rattled off iconic U.S. products including fried chicken from the fast food restaurant KFC and Coca Cola, saying the legislation would provide further protections for their secret recipes.  Theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets, is estimated to cost American firms more than $300 billion a year, according to a 2013 report by the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property. Trade secret theft already is a federal crime, but without the right to sue in federal court, companies must seek redress in state courts amid a patchwork of state laws. Corporations such as Boeing Co and Johnson & Johnson, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and computer software lobbyists representing companies such as Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, have pushed for the enhanced protections. Backers of the legislation have cited a case last year in which a South Korean company, Kolon Industries, was found guilty in U.S. federal court of conspiracy to steal trade secrets from DuPont. The foreign firm was ordered to pay $85 million in criminal fines and $275 million in restitution for illegally obtaining information on the chemical company\u2019s Kevlar body armor, which resulted in nearly $1 billion in economic losses for DuPont, according to lawmakers. In allowing civil suits in federal court for illegal procurement of trade secrets including manufacturing processes, formulas, computer algorithms, industrial designs, business strategies and customer lists, the legislation aims to create uniform standards for what constitutes trade secret theft. \u201cIn today\u2019s digital environment, it has never been easier to transfer trade secrets across the globe with the click of a cell phone, tablet, or computer key,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler, the leading Democratic co-sponsor of the legislation.

        "title": "White and male: broader bureaucracy mirrors Trump cabinet's profile",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Donald Trump faced criticism from advocacy groups for not including more women and minorities in his cabinet last January, the incoming administration promised that the lower rungs of the bureaucracy would ultimately look more diverse.  Now, recently available government data on the ethnic and gender make-up of the broader Trump administration shows that with over 1,000 mid-level political jobs filled by mid-year the appointees look much like the top leadership: mostly white and male. Office of Personnel Management numbers analyzed by Reuters show that 88 percent of such appointees were non-Hispanic white and 62 percent were men.  By comparison, in the final year of Barack Obama's Democratic administration, non-Hispanic whites made up 67 percent of that group and men accounted for 47 percent - closer to what the U.S. population looks like. Non-Hispanic whites account for 61 percent and men make up 49 percent, according to 2016 census data. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2xOf1ip) \u201cThis administration so far has not in any direct sense prioritized diversity,\u201d said Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, a non-partisan group that tracks federal hiring, when presented with Reuters\u2019 findings. Out of the Trump administration\u2019s 24 top cabinet-level positions, 17 are filled by white men.  Asked to comment on the mid-level personnel data, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said Trump had a long history of promoting women and pointed to last week\u2019s nomination of Kirstjen Nielsen to lead the Department of Homeland Security.  \u201cHe will continue to elevate and empower women to top posts in his administration,\u201d Walters said. She declined to discuss Trump\u2019s views on the ethnicity of political appointees. One day before Trump took office on Jan. 20, his then-spokesman Sean Spicer responded to criticism of the cabinet\u2019s lineup by saying that members were picked on their merits and  appointments across the broader federal bureaucracy would satisfy demands for more diversity.  \u201cPeople (will) look at and respect the level of diversity throughout his entire administration,\u201d he told reporters. The mid-level political positions, known as \u201cSchedule C\u201d and \u201cnon-career SES\u201d posts, numbered 1,051 in June, according to most recent data published in late September. How many more of those jobs have been filled since and whether their demographics has changed will be known at the end of the year, when third quarter numbers are expected. The positions include office managers, aides, policy experts and schedulers who are hired by top appointees, such as cabinet secretaries and their deputies. The mid-level bureaucrats act as a link between political leadership and over two million career civil servants who tend to work for multiple administrations.  In recent decades, such jobs would account for about half of some 4,000 positions that get filled anew with every change of administration. The OPM does not publish data on the more senior positions. The personnel office has published data sorted by gender that goes back to 1998 and by ethnicity since 2006, allowing comparisons with only two past administrations. Some political analysts say the profile of the new group of mid-level officials largely reflects a lower share of minorities among Republican voters and the fact that the Republican party has weaker ties to organizations that promote diversity and gender equality. \u201cIt\u2019s just a smaller set of folks who organize around those things and are connected to the Republican party,\u201d said David Lewis, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University who studies presidential appointments. In fact, this administration\u2019s numbers are similar to those under the previous Republican administration of George W. Bush. Between 2006-2008, the only Bush years covered by OPM gender, race and ethnicity data, men made up 60 percent of mid-level staff and 88 percent described themselves as non-Hispanic white. However, the United States has become more diverse over the past decade, making the numbers for this administration less representative of America\u2019s demographic makeup than was the case under Bush. In 2008, the last full year of the Bush administration, non-Hispanic whites made up 65 percent of the general population. Now that share is 4 percentage points lower, U.S. Census figures show.  Among Republican registered voters, the share of those identifying themselves as non-Hispanic white has edged down from 88 percent in 2008 to 86 percent just before the 2016 presidential election, according to the Pew Research Center. Women also have a larger share of overall U.S. jobs than during the Bush years. Their 38 percent share of mid-level political jobs in the current administration is a notch below the 40 percent average they had in 2001-2008. In 1998-2000, the final years of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency captured in the OPM data, that share averaged 51 percent. ",

        "title": "Pope, in change from predecessors, condemns nuclear arsenals for deterrence",
        "text": "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis appeared to harden the Catholic Church s teaching against nuclear weapons on Friday, saying countries should not stockpile them even for the purpose of deterrence. His remarks, at the start of a disarmament conference that brought 11 Nobel Peace Prize winners to the Vatican, appeared to go further than previous popes. They have said that while nuclear weapons should never be used, holding arsenals solely to deter other countries from using them could be morally acceptable as a step toward achieving a nuclear-free world. Addressing the group in the 16th century frescoed Clementine Hall of the Vatican s Apostolic Palace, Francis spoke of  the catastrophic humanitarian and environmental effects of any employment of nuclear devices . He added:  If we also take into account the risk of an accidental detonation as a result of error of any kind, the threat of their use, as well as their very possession, is to be firmly condemned.  As tensions between the United States and North Korea have increased, the pope has often warned that a nuclear conflict would destroy a good part of humanity and called for a third country to mediate the dispute. In his address, Francis did not directly mention the North Korea tension, but spoke in general of a  climate of instability and conflict  and a  mentality of fear  in the world today.  International relations cannot be held captive to military force, mutual intimidation, and the parading of stockpiles of arms,  he said. He also said international laws against proliferation of nuclear weapons had not kept new states from acquiring them. Money used to develop or modernize weapons should instead be spent on helping the poor and protecting the environment. Douglas Roche, Canada s former Ambassador for Disarmament and a former senator, told the conference the pope s remarks against possession of nuclear weapons were  historic  and asked  national conferences of Catholic bishops to work to make it known. Another participant suggested the pope should write an encyclical letter addressed to all Catholics on the moral imperative to ban nuclear weapons. Among those who met the pope were Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) and Mohamed El Baradei, director general emeritus of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Fihn, whose group won the Nobel this year, told Reuters she asked the pope to lead all 1.2 billion Catholics around the world in prayer for an end to the threat of nuclear weapons on Sunday, December 10, when her group is due to collect the prize.  Tensions are really high and the risks for nuclear weapons  use is higher than at the height of the Cold War, the Cuban missile crisis. I think that s really serious and we need to urgently do something about this,  she said. El Baradei, who won the peace prize in 2015, was asked how he would respond to U.S. President Donald Trump s threat to use unprecedented  fire and fury  against North Korea if it threatened the United States.  I go to pray,  he said. ",

        "title": "Trump says won't divest from his business while president",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would maintain ownership of his global business empire but hand off control to his two oldest sons while president, an arrangement that watchdogs said would not prevent conflicts of interest in the White House. Trump told a news conference he would resign from all positions overseeing his hotels, golf courses and hundreds of other businesses and move his assets into a trust to help ensure that he will not consciously take actions as president that would benefit him personally. Trump, a Republican, is under pressure to distance himself from his businesses before he moves into the White House on Jan. 20. Unlike other U.S. government officials, the president is not required by law to steer clear of conflicts of interest. \u201cI could actually run my business and run government at the same time. I don\u2019t like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to,\u201d Trump said. Ethics experts said the arrangement did not go far enough. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s ill-advised course will precipitate scandal and corruption,\u201d said Norman Eisen, a former White House ethics adviser under Democratic President Barack Obama. Walter Shaub, director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, said on Wednesday in a speech at a Washington think tank that his office recommends Trump \u201cdivest his conflicting assets\u201d to avoid conflicts. Trump appears to be still involved with his business while preparing to take office, saying he had turned down a $2 billion development deal in Dubai he had been offered over the weekend. The company that made the proposal, DAMAC, confirmed the discussions had taken place. The Trump Organization will not enter into any new overseas deals while Trump is president and will only undertake domestic projects after a company ethics adviser has approved them, said Trump adviser Sheri Dillon. Details of how the ethics adviser would operate, as well as several other aspects of the arrangements, were not immediately clear. Trump will only know of those deals if he hears about them through the news media, said Dillon, a lawyer at Morgan Lewis who focuses on tax and ethics. Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, will have no further involvement in managing the organization or her own clothing brand. Ivanka Trump said on her Facebook page that she would take time off to settle her family into their new home in Washington. The president-elect has named her husband, Jared Kushner, to a senior advisory role in the White House. Since Trump sold all his stocks last year, the Trump trust will hold only business assets and liquid assets such as cash, Dillon said.  A financial disclosure document he filed in May also showed loans from lenders such as Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Ladder Capital (LADR.K). Trump will not have to file a new disclosure form until 2018. Many other ethics experts, including the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, have urged Trump to completely divest or set up a blind trust for his assets. In a blind trust, the owner does now know what the holdings are or how the assets are managed. Trump\u2019s oldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr., will be running his business, so the arrangement does not meet that standard. Dillon said that was not a realistic possibility for a family-owned company and any sudden divestment would hurt Trump financially. Unlike liquid assets like stocks and investment funds, much of Trump\u2019s wealth comes from office towers and other real estate that cannot be sold easily, as well as licensing deals that could be difficult to unwind. Stripped of the Trump name, many of these assets would lose much of their value, Dillon said. \u201cPresident-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built,\u201d she said. Dillon dismissed concerns that Trump could violate an anti-bribery provision in the U.S. Constitution, known as the Emoluments Clause. That applies to gifts, but not business transactions like renting a hotel room, she said. Nevertheless, profits generated at Trump\u2019s hotels by foreign governments will be donated to the U.S. Treasury, she said. ",

        "text": "TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Gunmen killed at least four people and wounded nearly 40 on Wednesday in a suicide attack on a court complex in the Libyan city of Misrata, officials and a witness said. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, saying in a statement run by the group s Amaq news agency it had targeted  one of the most prominent strongholds  of Libya s U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). The attack shows the enduring militant threat in Libya after a Misrata-led coalition under nominal GNA command battled for more than six months last year to oust Islamic State from its former stronghold in Sirte, about 230 km (140 miles) southeast of Misrata. Since then, militants have been trying to regroup in the desert south of Sirte. They have stepped up their presence in remote areas, though attacks in urban centers have been rare.             Wednesday s attack was launched by several assailants who drove up to the complex in central Misrata in a black vehicle, a witness said.  One of them blew himself up at the gate and the other two with Kalashnikovs opened fire at random,  he said.  Shooting could be heard all over the city center after the attack.  The witness, who asked not to be named, said he believed the attackers had used rocket propelled grenades. The military alliance from Misrata that led the campaign in Sirte said two suicide attackers were involved in the operation, and that there had been an explosion after a gun battle lasting about 20 minutes. The attackers killed four and wounded 39, Misrata hospital said in a statement, listing names of victims. Two of the attackers blew themselves up and a third was killed during the gun battle, said a local security source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Bomb disposal experts also defused a booby-trapped car that had been packed with explosives to be used in the attack, he said. Misrata, a large commercial port about 190 km east of Tripoli, is one of Libya s major military power bases but the city itself has been largely immune from armed clashes and attacks in recent years. Dozens of Islamic State suspects are being held in the city. Libya slid into turmoil after a NATO-backed uprising that toppled long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi six years ago. It remains divided between loose political and military alliances based in the east and west, resulting in a security vacuum in the center of the country. As militants increased their activity in recent weeks to the south and east of Sirte, the United States launched two sets of air strikes against jihadist desert camps. The U.S. also provided air support for the Misrata-led campaign last year. ",

In his annual State of the European Union speech, Juncker sketched out a vision of a post-2019 EU where some 30 countries would be using the euro, with an EU finance minister running key budgets to help states in trouble. French, German and eastern European officials have made positive comments about the speech. Kern, who is running against Kurz in parliamentary elections on Oct. 15, told ORF radio there was no point in expanding the euro and Schengen zone as long as tax fraud, the practice of contracting out work to lower-cost eastern European firms and breaches of limits for government debt had not been vanquished.  It simply makes no sense to enlarge the euro zone before this has not been dealt with, because (otherwise) problems would get bigger,  Kern said, pointing to Greece s struggle for years on the verge of bankruptcy as a prime example of such problems.  If you like this is an expansion of the problems at the end of the day and not a plus in European cooperation. I think this concept is not thought through.  Kurz also pointed to Greece as a bad example of including countries which do not fulfil the conditions for public finances the EU has set for itself.  The euro and the Schengen zone is open for everybody, but only for those that fulfill the criteria... We must avoid another situation like the one in Greece,  Kurz said. ",

        "title": "Senate proposal on encryption gives judges broad powers",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators has begun circulating long-awaited draft legislation that would give federal judges clear authority to order technology companies like Apple to help law enforcement officials access encrypted data, according to sources familiar with the discussions. The proposal from Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, does not spell out how companies must provide access or the circumstances under which they could be ordered to help. It also does not create specific penalties for noncompliance, leaving that determination to judges, the sources said. Previous legislative efforts have focused on requiring technology products to have a built-in \u201cback door\u201d for law enforcement. The latest approach would not mandate any specific technology, but rather would require companies to figure out how to access the data. Congress has tried and failed for years to pass legislation that could prevent criminals and spies from \u201cgoing dark,\u201d or hiding from law enforcement by using encrypted computer and communications services. The latest effort died when the Obama administration signaled last fall that it would not support it. But Apple\u2019s high-profile showdown with the government over a federal magistrate judge\u2019s order that it unlock an iPhone connected to the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, has reopened the debate. Apple and the Justice Department are set to face off in court on Tuesday. \u201cThe going-dark issue has been gathering momentum (in Congress) like a train coming down the tracks, but it still seemed for a while like it was going to be a long time before it got to the station,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told Reuters in an interview. \u201cBut it arrived with a fury with this lawsuit.\u201d Apple and many of its allies argue that the court is over-reaching its authority in the San Bernardino case and that Congress should ultimately resolve the encryption debate. President Obama warned a tech conference earlier this month against \u201cfetishizing\u201d phones and made it clear that he supports law enforcement efforts to gain access to encrypted information. Administration officials have reviewed the legislation from Burr and Feinstein and offered suggested edits, the sources said, signaling that the White House may now be more open to a legislative approach. Still, the Burr-Feinstein effort is expected to face a steep climb in a gridlocked Congress wary about tackling such a complex and controversial issue during an election year. \u201cWe have previously been quite skeptical of legislative handling of this particular matter,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters last month after the Apple case began. \u201cI don\u2019t know at this point whether or not (conversations with lawmakers) will result in a piece of legislation that we will embrace.\u201d In an attempt to break the congressional stalemate on encryption, Democratic Senator Mark Warner and Republican Representative Michael McCaul, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, introduced legislation earlier this month to form a national encryption commission to further study the issue.  That effort has been criticized by some privacy advocates who believe its composition would be skewed to favor law enforcement. Others have complained that it would give Congress an excuse to continue postponing action on encryption.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s foreign minister warned during a trip to Washington on Tuesday about a rise in the use of populist fear tactics by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic, describing this as a threat to Europe, the United States and transatlantic relations. Speaking at George Washington University on Super Tuesday, the biggest\u00a0single day of state-by-state presidential nominating contests, Frank-Walter Steinmeier did not refer to Donald Trump or other candidates by name but he said he was concerned about the tone of the U.S. campaign. \u201cIn Germany and in Europe, something is gaining momentum in our domestic politics - and to be honest, I am also seeing it here in the United States during the primary campaigns. It\u2019s the politics of fear,\u201d Steinmeier said. Politicians in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have watched nervously as businessman and reality TV star Trump has moved from a long shot to the front-runner among Republicans seeking the party\u2019s nomination to run in the Nov. 8 general election. Trump has described Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s welcoming policy towards refugees as \u201cinsane\u201d and predicted it would cause rioting in Germany. He has also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been at odds with Europe since Moscow\u2019s annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region two years ago. Germany does not face a federal election until next year. But a new anti-immigrant party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), has emerged as a threat to Merkel\u2019s conservatives. The AfD wants Germany to shut its border to migrants and use force to repel them if necessary. \u201cThey pretend that we can seal ourselves off and leave the world outside to deal with its own problems. But that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Steinmeier said, referring to politicians in Europe and the United States. \u201cThe worst thing we could do is seal ourselves off,\u201d he said. In a subtle dig at Trump, who has promised to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and make the Mexicans pay for it, the German foreign minister added: \u201cSo if you ask me: building walls is a very bad idea - no matter who pays for them.\u201d ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan called on Wednesday for an end to Obamacare\u2019s financial protections for people with serious medical conditions, saying these consumers should be placed in state high-risk pools.  In election-year remarks that could shed light on an expected Republican healthcare alternative, Ryan said existing federal policy that prevents insurers from charging sick people higher rates for health coverage has raised costs for healthy consumers while undermining choice and competition. The rule, a cornerstone of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, has been praised by patient advocates for providing access to medical care for people who previously could not afford private health insurance. The Affordable Care Act also bars insurers from excluding coverage for pre-existing conditions. \u201cLess than 10 percent of people under 65 are what we call people with pre-existing conditions, who are really kind of uninsurable,\u201d Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told a student audience at Georgetown University.  \u201cLet\u2019s fund risk pools at the state level to subsidize their coverage, so that they can get affordable coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cYou dramatically lower the price for everybody else. You make health insurance so much more affordable, so much more competitive and open up competition.\u201d Charging the same rates to individuals regardless of their medical history is also a key part of group health plans in the private sector. House Republicans, after repeated votes to repeal Obamacare, have promised to produce their own alternative to the Affordable Care Act as part of a broader policy agenda intended to attract voters in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The policy document is expected just ahead of the Republican presidential nominating convention in July. High-risk pools, which existed before the healthcare law, are state-level entities that guarantee coverage for people with health problems. Analysts say they can be prohibitively expensive and offer less than optimal health coverage.  Republicans have proposed state-based risk pools as an Obamacare alternative in the past. Last week, the conservative Republican Study Committee recommended risk pools as part of the House policy agenda, saying premiums should be capped at 200 percent of a state\u2019s average.  ",

        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - Bangladesh called on Myanmar on Monday to allow nearly 1 million Rohingya Muslim refugees to return home under safe conditions, saying that the burden had become  untenable  on its territory. About 600,000 people have crossed the border since Aug. 25 when Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts were met by a counter-offensive by the Myanmar army in Rakhine state which the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.  This is an untenable situation,  Shameem Ahsan, Bangladesh s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told a U.N. pledging conference.  Despite claims to the contrary, violence in Rakhine state has not stopped. Thousands still enter on a daily basis.  Vital humanitarian aid must continue, Ahsan said, adding:  It is of paramount importance that Myanmar delivers on its recent promises and works towards safe, dignified, voluntary return of its nationals back to their homes in Myanmar.  Bangladesh s interior minister was in Yangon on Monday for talks to find a  durable solution , he said. But Myanmar continued to issue  propaganda projecting Rohingyas as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh , Ahsan said, adding:  This blatant denial of the ethnic identity of Rohingyas remains a stumbling block.  Myanmar considers the Rohingya to be stateless, although they trace their presence in the country back generations. Filippo Grandi, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, later told journalists that the two countries had begun talks on  repatriation . Conducive conditions have to be  recreated  in Rakhine, he said.  This must include a solution to the question of citizenship, or rather lack thereof for the Rohingya community,  Grandi said. Khaled al-Jarallah, deputy foreign minister of Kuwait, called on Myanmar authorities to  cease the practice of stripping the Rohingya minority of their right of citizenship, which as a result deprives them of the right to property and employment . Jordan s Queen Rania visited Rohingya refugee camps on Monday and called for a stronger response from the international community to the plight of the Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh to escape  systematic persecution  in Myanmar.   One has to ask, why is the plight of this Muslim minority group being ignored? Why has the systematic prosecution been allowed to play out for so long?  she asked after touring the camps. The United Nations has appealed for $434 million to provide life-saving aid to 1.2 million people for six months. A total of $344 million has been raised so far, a final U.N. statement said.  We need more money to keep pace with intensifying needs. This is not an isolated crisis, it is the latest round in a decades-long cycle of persecution, violence and displacement,  U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told the talks. An estimated 1,000-3,000 Rohingya still enter Bangladesh daily, William Lacy Swing, head of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. He called them:  these most rejected and vulnerable people in the world.  Joanne Liu, president of the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) or Doctors Without Borders, described them as  the walking dead .  There are only 210 hospital beds for 1 million refugees, malnutrition is on the rise and latrines are lacking to prevent contamination, she said.  The camp is a time-bomb, ticking towards a full-blown health crisis.  ",

        "title": "Leftists on cusp of power as weary Icelanders go to polls",
        "text": "REYKJAVIK (Reuters) - Angry over a string of political scandals, Icelanders may usher a long dominant center-right party out of the exit door in national elections on Saturday, handing power to a charismatic center-left opposition leader. Katr n Jakobsd ttir, 41, of the Left-Green Movement, has campaigned on a platform of restoring trust in government and leveraging an economic boom to increase public spending. With hair slick down, red lipstick, black coat and heels, Jakobsd ttir cast her vote in sunny Reykjavik.  I m feeling very good about today, and I ll have to be optimistic,  she told Reuters after casting her vote. Accompanied by her husband and three sons, she cheerfully took time to mingle with voters, who headed to polls on a   for Iceland   warm autumn day of about 7 Celsius (45 Fahrenheit).  In the second snap parliamentary election in a year, the latest opinion polls showed her trailing Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson s pro-business Independence Party by a small margin. Both parties have polled around 20 percent for most of October. Whichever wins will likely nominate a prime minister who will then be invited to form a coalition government.   I think this will be an exciting election night as there has been a lot of movement in the polls,  Jakobsd ttir said.  We ll be waiting until the morning hours, I won t go to bed until six in the morning.  The Independence Party has been part of every government since 1980, except the coalition that served during the crisis years of 2009-2013, which included the Left-Greens, with Jakobsdottir as education minister.  In her favor this time is the fact that the left-leaning Social Democrats are likely to become the third-biggest party., and that Icelanders appear as primed for change as at any time in recent memory. The Nordic island of 340,000 people, one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 global financial crisis, has staged a remarkable economic turnaround spurred by tourism.  But scandals, a growing sense of inequality and worries over immigration threaten stability in one of the world s most homogeneous nations. Benediktsson has been weakened by fallout from an attempt by his father to vouch for the character of a convicted pedophile. The previous snap election took place late in 2016, after the Panama Papers revelations showed several government figures  involved in an offshore tax haven scandal. That gave a boost to the anti-establishment Pirate Party but its support has since waned. Forming a government this time could take months, as polls show a further five parties winning more than the five percent of votes needed to enter parliament.  I just hope something changes, and there ll be more cooperation,  said Ingunn Erlendsd ttir, 73, a retired ministry employee.  We are only a small nation of just over 300,000, and we need to stand together,  said the pensioner, adding that she has traditionally voted for the right but this time cast her ballot for a left-wing party. Known for her even temper, Jakobsdottir quickly became a popular figure in Iceland after being elected to parliament in 2007, and is one of the few high-profile politicians who have avoided scandal.  Our campaign has been fun, and we ve taken it you could say back to the roots. Walking door to door, having meetings and meeting people in the real world,  she said.  While most parties agree that investment is needed in areas like welfare, infrastructure and tourism, the debate is around how it will be financed. The left-leaning parties, including Jakobsd ttir s, want to finance spending by raising taxes on the wealthy, real estate and the powerful fishing industry.  Having presided over the privatization of banks, financial sector liberalization and the economy s collapse and eventual economic recovery during its several stints in power, the Independence Party has said it wants to fund infrastructure spending by taking money out of the banking sector.

        "text": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - African National Congress (ANC) MP Makhosi Khoza, a strident critic of scandal-plagued President Jacob Zuma, quit South Africa s ruling party on Thursday, labeling Nelson Mandela s 105-year-old liberation movement  alien and corrupt . The 47-year-old Zulu linguistics expert, an ANC supporter since the age of 12, denounced Zuma in July as a  dishonorable and disgraceful leader  due to the litany of scandals he has attracted during his eight years in power. Her comments earned her death threats and a provincial party disciplinary hearing, but Khoza said she was not prepared to sit around and wait for the verdict from a party she said was willfully blind to the failings of its leader.  Why haven t we charged Zuma? Why are we charging Makhosi Khoza? We are making a mockery of the rule of law. We are making a mockery of the ANC constitution,  she said in an interview on the SABC, the state broadcaster.  Charge Zuma. Fire Zuma from the ANC, then I will know that you are serious about self-correcting.  Khoza is believed to have been one of around 30 ANC members of parliament who voted against Zuma in an ultimately unsuccessful Aug. 8 parliamentary no-confidence vote conducted by secret ballot. ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa did not answer calls to his mobile phone. The most serious allegations against Zuma relate to his friendship with the Guptas, a family of Indian-born businessmen accused of using political influence to secure lucrative contracts with state-run companies and remain above the law. Zuma and the Guptas, who employ Zuma s son, Duduzane, as a director of at least one of their companies, have denied any wrongdoing and say they are the victims of a politically motivated witch-hunt. Zuma s time at the helm of the ANC comes to an end in December when the party chooses a new leader, although he will remain head of state until 2019 unless the ANC removes him early, as it did with President Thabo Mbeki in 2008. As Khoza fulminated on air, Zuma s former wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma was sworn in behind closed doors as a member of parliament, cementing the belief she is his preferred successor against challengers led by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. The parliamentary seat gives Dlamini-Zuma, ex-chairwoman of the African Union Commission in Addis Ababa, a platform from which to raise her profile ahead of December s party leadership conference. Separately, the Pretoria High Court delivered a blow to the Gupta s media-to-mining commercial empire, throwing out its attempt to block India s Bank of Baroda, the last bank in South Africa prepared to handle its money, from pulling the plug. Judge Hans Fabricius dedicated eight pages of his verdict to the allegations against the Guptas, questioning why police and prosecutors had failed to act despite years of stunning media revelations and numerous formal criminal complaints.  I could not help wonder whether, unbeknown to me, democracy and the rule of law had somehow been suspended,  he said, lamenting the decline from the optimism and idealism of the self-styled  Rainbow Nation  immediately after apartheid ended.  Could it be possible that the future, so bright in 1994, was now only history?  he continued.  Do the various investigating bodies of the police service ... still remember their constitutional duty to combat and investigate crime?  Gary Naidoo, editor of the Gupta-owned New Age newspaper and the family s de facto spokesman, was not available for comment. ",

        "title": "In new blow to campaign, Trump's foundation ordered to halt fundraising",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York\u2019s attorney general ordered Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s charitable foundation to immediately stop fundraising in the state, warning that a failure to do so would be a \u201ccontinuing fraud.\u201d For Trump, the cease-and-desist order was the latest in a series of blows that has sent his campaign reeling. The New York businessman and his aides spent much of the weekend dealing with the fallout from a New York Times report that said Trump may have avoided paying federal income taxes for almost 20 years. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\u2019s office said the Donald J. Trump Foundation was violating a state law requiring charitable organizations that solicit outside donations to register with the office\u2019s Charities Bureau. The order followed a series of reports in The Washington Post that suggested improprieties by the foundation, including using its funds to settle legal disputes involving Trump businesses. \u201cThe failure immediately to discontinue solicitation and to file information and reports required under Article 7-A with the Charities Bureau shall be deemed to be a continuing fraud upon the people of the state of New York,\u201d according to a letter dated on Friday that the office posted online on Monday. Trump\u2019s campaign has suggested that the probe launched by Schneiderman, a Democrat, was politically motivated. While again putting Trump\u2019s campaign on the defensive, the order could also undercut his efforts to make the Clinton Foundation, the family charity of Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton, a primary target in his campaign against her for the Nov. 8 election. Trump has sought to paint the Clinton Foundation as a \u201cpay-to-play\u201d operation under which the former U.S. secretary of state and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, rewarded big donors to the foundation with access. The Clinton Foundation, which has $354 million in assets and almost 500 staffers, is a radically different charitable vehicle from the small-scale Trump nonprofit. It has worked to reduce the cost of drugs for people with HIV in developing countries, eradicate childhood obesity in the United States and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There has been no evidence that foreign donors to the foundation obtained favors from the State Department while Clinton headed the agency. While some donors were able to obtain meetings with her or senior State Department officials, Clinton has said the fact that they had donated to the foundation did not play a role in her decision to meet with them. The scrutiny of the Trump Foundation came as the Republican candidate was dealing with a torrent of bad news, including his shaky performance in his first debate with Clinton on Sept. 26 and the release by the New York Times of tax records that showed Trump taking an almost $1 billion loss in 1995 that may have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years. In its series on the Trump Foundation, The Washington Post reported that Trump may have violated U.S. Internal Revenue Service rules against \u201cself-dealing\u201d by using foundation money to purchase two portraits of himself, which were then hung at his private golf clubs in New York and Florida. The newspaper also said that Trump may have improperly used the foundation to settle legal disputes, including one at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, diverted income from his business to the charity to avoid paying income tax, and donated foundation money to support Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Republican, who was considering launching an investigation into Trump University, Trump\u2019s for-profit education venture. The foundation ended up paying a $2,500 fine to the IRS for that donation. A Trump Organization representative told the Post the donation was meant to be from Trump\u2019s personal account, and that it came from his foundation\u2019s account by clerical error. In response to the Post\u2019s reporting, Schneiderman\u2019s office began a probe into the Trump Foundation. The Trump campaign said in a statement on Monday that the charity would cooperate with the investigation. \u201cWhile we remain very concerned about the political motives behind AG Schneiderman\u2019s investigation, the Trump Foundation nevertheless intends to cooperate fully with the investigation,\u201d said Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks. \u201cBecause this is an ongoing legal matter, the Trump Foundation will not comment further at this time,\u201d she added. The New York Attorney General\u2019s Office is the sole regulator of charities in the state. A spokesman for the office said it was not unusual for the regulator to send notices to charities whose filings were overdue or incomplete but that a cease-and-desist letter was more serious. While letters such as the one the Trump Foundation, which is based in Woodbury, New York, on Long Island, received are not judgments of wrongdoing, they are sent only after the office gets \u201ca clear indication of wrongdoing,\u201d the spokesman said. Trump established the charitable foundation in 1988, but it runs no programs of its own. Instead, it donates money to other nonprofit groups such as the Police Athletic League for youths. Once the foundation began soliciting money from other donors beyond the Trump family, it was required by New York law to register with the state and file regular reports. ",

        "title": "Trump's jobs homecoming a long shot even in manufacturing hot spots ",
        "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla (Reuters) - When U.S. manufacturing employment peaked, Jimmy Carter was president, inflation was 11 percent, and craftsmen at Frontier Contact Lenses made the company\u2019s products one at a time on diamond-tipped lathes. As presidential candidates promise to reclaim jobs lost in the intervening decades, they might want to visit the company now. Bought by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in 1981, the fully automated factory allows four workers to produce in a 12-hour shift what more labor-intensive methods produced in a year. The Jacksonville plant and one in Ireland make 4 billion soft contacts a year, and between the robots and lasers and computer algorithms no worker touches the product from the start of the process through final packaging. \u201cI don\u2019t think you could even make 4 billion lenses\u201d using the old method, said David Turner, vice president of research and development for Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc. \u201cYou\u2019d need a guy with a lathe in every town.\u201d Since peaking at 19.5 million in 1979, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs has fallen 37 percent to around 12.2 million as of March, or just over 10 percent of the private sector workforce. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1WqpioK) That may be as good as it gets. Despite the promises made on the campaign trail by Republican frontrunner Donald Trump and other candidates, the next president will find it hard to raise manufacturing\u2019s share of a U.S. labor force that keeps shifting toward services. While much of the jobs debate has centered on trade pacts  that Democrats and Republicans have backed over the last quarter century, both successful and struggling companies and sectors offer evidence of long-term trends that neither sharp trade negotiators nor aggressive political leaders can easily reverse. Even critics of trade deals acknowledge that labor intensive industries, such as textiles, which once employed hundreds of thousands of less-skilled workers, are probably gone for good. Technology continues to diminish the share of labor in production and its spread around the world has made other nations - notably China, but also Korea, Brazil, Mexico and former Soviet bloc countries - competitive both as exporters and in their own markets. Investment worldwide is drifting steadily toward services, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and Americans are spending relatively less of their income on manufactured goods.     A Reuters analysis of federal data for 1,267 categories of goods shows that the United States has been running a trade deficit in more than 500 of them since at least 1992 - before the North American Free Trade Agreement came into force or China joined the World Trade Organization, events often cited as turning points for U.S. manufacturing. Since the 2007-2009 recession manufacturing has added about 800,000 jobs, but that has lagged overall job growth. As a result manufacturing\u2019s share of private employment has continued to fall, from about 11 percent since the recession ended. \u201cThe move toward a more global market hurts the marginal, low-skilled worker, but it was inevitable and you cannot roll it back,\u201d said Brookings Institution senior fellow Barry Bosworth. At CareerSource Northeast Florida, a job development group, President Bruce Ferguson, Jr. said by necessity he focused on finding a \u201cpath\u201d for entry level service sector employees to move up a career ladder, because services are where the growth is.   \u201cThe raw (manufacturing) numbers don\u2019t look anything like the service sector and they never will,\u201d he said.  A majority of 6,500 Americans surveyed in March as part of Reuters/Ipsos 2016 campaign polling acknowledged that free trade brings lower prices, but also saw it as a drag on wages and jobs and an \u201cimportant\u201d issue for the next president to confront. Tapping such concerns, Trump has promised punitive tariffs to \u201cbring back\u201d jobs for those left behind in the current recovery, particularly the roughly two thirds of Americans without a college degree.    Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton switched gears as a candidate to oppose a major Pacific trade deal and promises billions in public support for manufacturing. Her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders calls for worker protection against what he considers unfair trade, while Republican Ted Cruz has focused on trimming government red tape. However, playing tough on trade carries some risks and there are limits to what trade talks and tariffs can accomplish. The U.S. steel industry is a case in point. The American Iron and Steel Institute estimates around 12,000 jobs were lost to a recent jump in imports, mainly from China. It reckons those jobs could be recovered with steps, such as the anti-dumping duties imposed by Washington late last year. That pales, however, in comparison with more than 200,000 jobs that the sector has lost since the early 1980s, some because of imports, but some because the amount of labor needed to produce a ton of steel has fallen from 10 hours to less than two.  \u201cThere has been a short term loss that is definitely attributable to imports, while a longer term trend reflects technological innovation,\u201d said Kevin Dempsey, the institute\u2019s senior vice president.  Such dynamic is not limited to old industries like steel. Florida is home to successful manufacturers big and small in a wide range of sectors, which export nearly half of their output - double the national average. Yet, as is the case nationally, the share of jobs available to those with a high school degree has been shrinking since 2000, according to federal data, and wages have been stagnant. Johnson & Johnson Vision Care\u2019s recent approval of a $300 million expansion, which added some 100 jobs, cements the company\u2019s U.S. presence, but also shows how technology and innovation reshape the landscape. The company\u2019s local workforce has risen to around 1,700, but about 60 percent of that are white collar and non-manufacturing jobs - from research positions for PhD scientists to those in sales and a highly automated shipping operation. Florida development officials say the trend is clear: manufacturers keep cutting the labor content of their products and each round of investment tends to drive up the skill levels that workers need. That may benefit the state\u2019s economy, but acts as a reality check for workers who hope that the November 8 presidential vote can reverse decades-old trends. \u201cHow do you evaluate a company that says we will spend a lot of money and make the workforce more qualified but not create many jobs?\u201d said Aaron Bowman, senior vice president for business development at JAXUSA Partnership, a regional economic development agency and division of the local chamber of commerce. \u201cOver time you see more projects that bring in fewer jobs but a bigger bang.\u201d     ",

        "title": "U.S. senator probes Pentagon on Russian source code reviews",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. senator on Tuesday asked the Defense Department to explain how it manages the risks when it uses software that has been scrutinized by foreign governments, saying the practice may represent a national security threat. Reuters reported earlier this month that Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co allowed a Russian defense agency to review the source code or inner workings of cyber defense software known as ArcSight, which is used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks. \u201cHPE\u2019s ArcSight system constitutes a significant element of the U.S. military\u2019s cyber defenses,\u201d Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis seen by Reuters.  Shaheen, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said disclosure of ArcSight\u2019s source code to the Russian agency presented an \u201copportunity to exploit a system used on [Defense Department] platforms.\u201d Shaheen questioned whether the Trump administration was pushing back on demands for source code from Russia and elsewhere that are imposed on U.S. companies as a condition for entry into foreign markets.  Such reviews highlight a quandary for U.S. technology companies, as they weigh U.S. cyber security protections while pursuing business with some of Washington\u2019s adversaries, including Russia and China, according to security experts. \u201cI understand that individual businesses must make decisions weighing the risk of intellectual property disclosure against the opportunity of accessing significant overseas markets,\u201d Shaheen wrote. \u201cHowever, when such products undergird [Defense Department] cyber defenses, our national security may be at stake in these decisions.\u201d The Pentagon and HPE did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the letter. Cyber security experts, former U.S. intelligence officials and former ArcSight employees said the review of ArcSight\u2019s core instruction, also known as source code, could help Moscow discover weaknesses in the software, potentially helping hackers to blind the U.S. military to an attack.  HPE has said in the past that such reviews, by a Russian government-accredited testing company, have taken place for years at a research and development center it operates outside of Russia. The software maker has also said it closely supervises the process and that no code is allowed to leave the premises, ensuring it does not compromise the safety of its products. A company spokeswoman said last week that no current HPE products have undergone Russian source code reviews. HPE was spun off from Hewlett-Packard Inc as a separate software company in 2015.  Shaheen\u2019s letter asked Mattis whether he foresaw risks associated with the disclosure of ArcSight\u2019s code and whether the Pentagon was monitoring whether technology vendors share source code or \u201cother sensitive technical data.\u201d  She also asked how frequently vendors disclose the source code of products used by the Pentagon to foreign governments. Shaheen recently led successful efforts in Congress to ban all government use of software provided by Moscow-based antivirus firm Kaspersky Lab, amid allegations the company is allied with Russian intelligence. Kaspersky vehemently denies such links. Tech companies have been under increasing pressure to allow the Russian government to examine source code in exchange for approvals to sell products in Russia. While many Western firms have complied, some, including California-based cyber firm Symantec, have refused. ArcSight was sold to British tech company Micro Focus International Plc in a deal completed in September. The company said last week that while source code reviews were a common industry practice, it would restrict future reviews by \u201chigh-risk\u201d governments and subject them to chief executive approval.

        "title": "Ukraine prosecutor says puzzled by lack of U.S. help on Manafort case",
        "text": "KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine is puzzled by the lack of a U.S. response to requests it has made to question former Donald Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort as a witness over two cases involving misuse of Ukrainian state funds, the chief investigator said. Manafort was indicted last month in Washington on charges he denies ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agent of former pro-Kremlin president Viktor Yanukovich s Party of Regions. The charges, some going back more than a decade, mention neither Trump nor his campaign. Serhii Horbatiuk, head of special investigations at the general prosecutor s office, told Reuters Ukraine had sent requests in 2014 and 2015 to question representatives of a law firm and Manafort. He said Ukraine had received reassurances from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that the requests would be met, but without result.    Of course it s not normal,  Horbatiuk said in an interview at his office.  I would not say that we are upset, I would not say officially that we are upset, but it s not clear why it is so,  he said.  Even the results they have got so far, we could have got them back in 2015 or 2016 with their help. But during these years there was no cooperation for unknown reasons.  In Washington, the FBI and the Department did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment. Horbatiuk is investigating two cases.  One relates to the suspected illegal use of Ukrainian state funds by justice ministry officials to pay a U.S. law firm for a report used to justify the imprisonment of former prime minister and political rival Yulia Tymoshenko during Yanukovich s rule. The second relates to a so-called  Black Ledger  discovered after Yanukovich s 2014 ouster by street protests, a book supposedly listing payments from a slush fund by Yanukovich s Party of Regions to their associates, including Manafort. Yanukovich denies corruption accusations.  Manafort denies all wrongdoing and in Ukraine he is at this stage only wanted as a witness.  Horbatiuk said he had not been contacted for assistance by the team of Special Council Robert Mueller, who indicted Manafort during an investigation into alleged Russian efforts to swing the 2016 presidential election in Trump s favor.  Manafort s attorney says his work for the Ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the Trump campaign. But the indictment sheds new light on the Ukrainian cases: the allegation that Manafort used offshore accounts to funnel $4 million to pay for the Tymoshenko report was news to Horbatiuk s team, who thought the report had cost around $1 million. He will submit a new request for help to the U.S. within weeks.  It is important to combine our investigations so that we can obtain information to determine the origin of this money ($4 million),  he said.   And the general information allows us to say that the investigation could be promising provided that the law enforcement agencies of the United States and Ukraine cooperate in what we are interested in.      Manafort joined the Trump presidential campaign in March 2016 and later became campaign manager, but he was forced to resign in August as questions emerged about his previous work for Yanukovich s party.",

        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. short-term rental service Airbnb Inc has removed listings in Beijing as the capital prepares to host a five-yearly Party Congress later this month, the most important event on China s political calendar during which security is at its highest. A Reuters search on Wednesday of Airbnb listings in the city s center yielded  zero  results for all of October. Listings were present as recently as Tuesday evening for periods including the congress dates of Oct. 18 to 31.  Due to external circumstances, homes in certain areas in Beijing are unavailable through October 31,  Airbnb said in an email to hosts reviewed by Reuters. The move, mirrored by local rental firms, comes a week before the congress where President Xi Jinping is widely expected to consolidate power in a leadership reshuffle. Such high-profile events are often accompanied by increased surveillance and online censorship. During the last Congress, in 2012, access to Alphabet Inc s Google search engine was cut off. Google services have since been blocked in China. For this year s event, authorities have stepped up ID checks at metro stations and elsewhere in an effort to detain unregistered workers and others illegally residing in Beijing. Four Airbnb hosts in the capital told Reuters they had received notices from the U.S. firm late on Tuesday, which said properties in certain areas of the city would be removed from its website until the end of the month due to  external circumstances .  Similar to action taken by other hospitality companies, Airbnb listings in certain areas in Beijing will be temporarily unavailable throughout October,  the company said in a statement to Reuters. Short-term rentals were also unavailable during the same period via local services Xiaozhu.com and Tujia.com. Neither firm responded to requests for comment. Airbnb and other home-stay sites occupy a legal grey area in China, where tourists are required to register accommodation with local police using a passport or identification card. The requirement is harder to enforce with short-term rentals. The Ministry of Public Security and Beijing s city police did not respond to faxed requests for comment.  (The congress blackout) is a pain, but it s not for such a long time,  said a 28-year-old press relations worker surnamed Liu, who rents out two flats on both Xiaozhu and Airbnb.

        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium has received proposals from Britain and the United States to replace its ageing fleet of fighter jets, while a French proposal that was not part of the tender process will be looked at separately, Belgium s defense minister said. Belgium invited government-led proposals in March for the replacement of its fleet of Lockheed Martin F-16 planes with 34 new fighters, in a deal that could be worth more than 3.5 billion euros ($4.2 billion). Last month, France proposed a wide-ranging military deal with Belgium instead of responding to the tender. The deal goes beyond the terms of the tender whilst including the sale of Rafale fighter jets. While the French offer would be discussed by the government, it could open Belgium to criticism that it was not treating candidates equally, Vandeput said.  To be very clear, the French offer is not part of the contest,  minister Steven Vandeput told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday. Offers from the U.S. for Lockheed F-35 Lightning II planes and British offers for the Eurofighter Typhoon did meet the tender rules, the minister added. A spokeswoman for the defense ministry said the French proposal was being checked by its legal services and forwarded to the government which would decide at a later stage whether or not to respond.     The Rafales are made by France s Dassault Aviation which declined to comment on Thursday. Boeing pulled out of the race last spring. The French government said that its proposal was in line with Belgium s request.  We have made an extended proposal which is legally relevant and we are waiting for a proposal by the Belgian government,  a spokeswoman for the French defense ministry said. Belgium will make a decision on which jet fighter to pick next year. The 34 jets are to be delivered from 2023, at a rate of 4-5 aircraft a year. ",

We appreciate his years of dedicated service to the State Department.\u201d Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick as the next U.S. ambassador to Beijing, is expected to take up the post later this month. A tweet from China expert John Pomfret quoted unnamed sources as saying that Rank had resigned as he could not support Trump\u2019s decision last week to withdraw from the Paris agreement. Another tweet from Pomfret said Rank called a town hall meeting to announce his decision to embassy staff and explained that he could not deliver a diplomatic note informing the Chinese government of the U.S. decision. A senior U.S. official confirmed the account given in the tweets but added that after Rank announced his intention to retire on Monday in Beijing, he was told by the State Department to leave his post immediately. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. On June 1, the U.S. State Department accepted the resignation of its top personnel officer, who had been among its  few remaining senior Obama administration political appointees, another U.S. official said. Arnold Chacon had served as the director general of the foreign service and director of human resources. The official said Chacon had tendered his resignation when Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, along with all presidential appointees, who serve at the pleasure of the president and secretary of state. The acceptance of Chacon\u2019s resignation was first reported by the DiploPundit website. It was not immediately clear whether he would be offered another post at the department.  Other than Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, his deputy John Sullivan and Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Tom Shannon, the third-ranking U.S. diplomat, most of the State Department\u2019s senior posts are currently vacant or filled by acting officials. Chacon could not immediately be reached for comment.  Contacted by Reuters for comment, Rank, a career foreign service officer who took over the post of deputy chief of mission in Beijing in January 2016, referred all questions to the U.S. embassy. Jonathan Fritz, the embassy\u2019s economics councilor, would serve as charg\u00e9 in his place, Richey-Allen said. Rank had been with the department for 27 years and served as the political councilor at the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2012. Trump\u2019s announcement on Thursday that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, saying it would undermine the U.S. economy and cost jobs, drew anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. \u201cThe world has paid attention to the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris agreement\u201d, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing on Tuesday, but added that personnel changes were the United States\u2019 \u201cinternal affairs\u201d.

        "title": "Kenya officials change way of announcing election results",
        "text": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - Official results from Kenya s repeat presidential election on Thursday are likely to take several days to collate, election officials told Reuters, due to changes in the process to try to make it more transparent. The Supreme Court on Sept. 1 ordered a repeat of the election after judges annulled the results of an Aug. 8 poll, pitting incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta against opposition leader Raila Odinga, due to procedural irregularities. Official results said Kenyatta won on Aug. 8 by 1.4 million votes, but Odinga said the vote was rigged. Odinga has refused to participate in Thursday s rerun because he said election officials have not carried out sufficient reforms. Judges criticized the election board for rushing to announce the official results based only on numbers sent from the polling stations, without having the tally forms from all 40,883 polling stations showing the results. The paper forms are a back-up system meant to help prevent rigging. The board has up to a week to announce official results. This time, polling stations will only transmit scanned images of tally forms from polling stations, not numerical results, Andrew Limo, spokesman for the election commission, said on Tuesday. The scanned images will be posted online. The election board will collate and publish results by constituency once all polling stations there have reported. This could take several days in rural constituencies with poor phone networks and far-flung polling stations. There are 290 constituencies. Without Odinga running, Kenyatta is the firm favorite to win. The other six candidates failed to poll more than 1 percent in the August polls; one has since been disqualified for bankruptcy. Odinga has urged supporters to boycott the ballot and opposition leaders have called for protests on the day of the elections.  The key thing to watch in this election will be turnout,  said Murithi Mutiga, a senior regional analyst for the International Crisis Group, a global thinktank.   This will really be a referendum on the legitimacy of Kenyatta s second term.   Just over 79 percent of Kenya s 19.6 million registered voters cast a ballot in the last poll. ",

        "title": "Factbox - Battle for Raqqa, Islamic State's Syrian HQ near end",
        "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - The battle for the city of Raqqa, which Islamic State had used as its headquarters in Syria, is drawing to an end. Islamic State militants have lost swathes of land to various offensives across Syria and Iraq, forced into a diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley. Their defeat in Raqqa would be a milestone in the fight to roll back the theocratic  caliphate  Islamic State declared in 2014 in both countries. Following are some facts about Raqqa: Raqqa sits on the Euphrates river around 90 km (56 miles) from the Turkish border in north central Syria.  Hardline Sunni militant group Islamic State overran Raqqa in January 2014, seizing control from rebel factions opposed to the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The United States has said Islamic State planned and sent teams from Raqqa to carry out attacks on cities including Paris, Brussels and Istanbul.  THE ANTI-IS OFFENSIVE The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of mostly Kurdish and Arab militias, began to advance towards Raqqa city in November 2016. After encircling the city, they launched the offensive to take it, facing tough resistance.  The United States-led coalition supports the SDF with air strikes and special forces on the ground.  The battle for Raqqa has taken a severe toll on civilians. The United Nations said in March the city contained around 200,000 people, just under its pre-war population.  Since late last year, fighting around and in Raqqa has displaced tens of thousands of people. Many have fled the city to camps in surrounding territory now under the control of the SDF and its strongest component, the Kurdish YPG militia.  Civilians trapped inside the Islamic State enclave in the city have endured miserable conditions for months, lacking water, power, food and healthcare. Parts of Raqqa that the SDF captured have mostly been cleared of residents.     Air strikes, fighting and Islamic State snipers and mines have killed many hundreds of people.   The coalition says it is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and Iraq. But the U.N. human rights office and rights group Amnesty International have raised concerns about reports of high civilian deaths.  Islamic State has imposed its very strict interpretation of Islamic law on Raqqa s residents. The fighters have carried out public executions, lashings and violent punishments for infringements of their rule. The Raqqa campaign has stirred tension between the United States and NATO-ally Turkey. Potential Kurdish influence in the future of the mainly Arab city is sensitive both for some activists from Raqqa and for Turkey.   The YPG has become the main U.S. partner in the fight against Islamic State in northern Syria. Ankara views it as a Syrian extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency within Turkey, and fears growing Kurdish power along its border. The SDF s political allies have set up a Raqqa Civil Council of people from the city, which the SDF says it will hand control to once its fighters have defeated Islamic State. This echoes the pattern in other towns and cities that the SDF captured. The U.S.-led coalition has helped train a new police force for the city.  Islamic State has made enemies of all sides in the more than six-year Syrian conflict, with separate offensives now trying to clear it from its last foothold in the towns along the Euphrates river in eastern Syria near the Iraqi border. Besides the U.S.-backed SDF, the Syrian army, with Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, is also waging its own campaign against Islamic State in eastern Syria.     A modern-day provincial transport hub and market town, Raqqa was built by the Abbasid Islamic Caliphate in the eighth century, serving as its capital at one point. It has been inhabited since antiquity and contains important archaeological and architectural sites. The United Nations has said they have been extensively looted during the war and religious buildings have been damaged. Islamic State militants released a video of them bombing a large part of the Uwais al-Qarani shrine complex in March 2014. ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s swift exit as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s communications director on Monday has no bearing on the pending sale of the firm he founded, SkyBridge Capital, parties involved in the deal said.  \u201cThe transaction remains on track and is expected to close by the end of the summer,\u201d said Robert Rendine, a spokesman for HNA Capital U.S., a subsidiary of Chinese conglomerate HNA Group. HNA, along with holding company Ron Transatlantic EG, in January announced an agreement to purchase a majority stake in SkyBridge, the New York-based hedge fund investment firm. The sale came as Scaramucci planned to join the Trump administration, although it took months for a role to materialize and was not the one he initially anticipated. A representative for Ron was not immediately available, but a person familiar with the company, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the transaction was on track.  Woomi Yun, a spokeswoman for SkyBridge, also said the deal was proceeding as planned and was expected to close by the end of the summer. She declined to comment on Scaramucci\u2019s exit from the White House and whether he would return to the firm.  Scaramucci did not respond to an email and phone call seeking comment. Trump fired Scaramucci on Monday just over a week after naming him to the job. The move followed an obscene tirade by the Wall Street financier and the appointment of retired Marine Corps General John Kelly as White House chief of staff, sources familiar with the decision said, in the latest staff upheaval to hit the Republican president\u2019s six-month-old administration. The sale of SkyBridge is under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS. A spokesman for the Treasury Department, which chairs CFIUS, did not respond to an email request for comment. HNA has been on a multibillion-dollar international acquisition spree, scooping up stakes in companies including Deutsche Bank , Old Mutual Asset Management  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc . HNA\u2019s chief executive officer, Adam Tan, recently pushed back against media reports that the aviation-to-financial services conglomerate faces mounting pressure from its bankers and regulators, even as the pace of its acquisitions slows.

        "title": "Turkey casts Zarrab case as attempt to undermine its politics, economy",
        "text": "ISTANBUL/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey cast the testimony of a wealthy gold trader in a U.S. court as an attempt to undermine Ankara and its economy on Friday, highlighting how President Tayyip Erdogan may use the politically charged case to rally nationalist support. The trader, Reza Zarrab, told a New York court on Wednesday that Erdogan had authorized a transaction in a scheme to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions. A dual national of Iran and Turkey, Zarrab is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors in the trial of a Turkish bank executive accused of helping Iran launder money. The executive has pleaded not guilty.  This court case has stopped being judicial and become completely political, with the sole aim to corner Turkey and its economy,  Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said. The case has aggravated tension between Ankara and Washington, NATO allies already at odds over Syria policy and the United States  failure to extradite the Muslim cleric Turkey accuses of engineering a failed military coup last year. Although the economic fall-out from the case could be substantial - especially if U.S. authorities fine Turkish banks - analysts said that Erdogan is unlikely to be damaged politically at home and could potentially emerge stronger by attracting more nationalist support.  This will bolster his claim that he is fighting an independence battle against foreign enemies,  said Halil Karaveli, editor of the Turkey Analyst, a policy journal.   If there is going to be any political impact, I suspect it will actually help in the electoral sense.  Media coverage of the case has been limited in Turkey and one pro-government outlet branded the trial as a conspiracy by  enemies  of the country. Erdogan, who has governed Turkey for almost 15 years, has not yet responded to the courtroom claims; but had already dismissed the case as a politically inspired attempt to bring down the Turkish government. His government says the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for the failed military coup, was also behind the court case.  Zarrab s deposition before the U.S. court will not impact the outlook of the AK Party constituency. In return, mitigating the possible economic impact will be more of a challenge especially if Turkish banks are eventually fined,  said Sinan Ulgen, an analyst and former Turkish diplomat. International investors have grown nervous about Turkey as ties with the United States have worsened - helping drive the  lira currency down some 10 percent against the dollar in the past three months, to a series of record lows. But the U.S. legal action over the alleged Iran sanctions busting, and the risk that some of the country s banks might be sucked into the case, lies at the heart of the latest investor concerns. U.S. prosecutors charge that the executive of Turkey s state-owned Halkbank, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, helped Iran launder the money. Halkbank, like Atilla, has said it is not guilty of the charges. In his testimony, Zarrab also said that Turkish officials had authorized two Turkish banks, Ziraat Bank and VakifBank, to move funds for Iran. Both Ziraat and VakifBank have denied taking part in any such scheme. Nonetheless, investors are worried about the possibility that Turkish banks could be fined.  If there is a fine that s outsize and the Turkish government doesn t want to pay or allow the bank to pay, it will turn into a political standoff which is not great for banks or sovereign spreads,  said Greg Saichin, head of emerging debt at Allianz Global Investors in London.  This whole issue is weighing heavily on Turkey as a country to allocate (capital) to.  ",

        "text": "MINSK (Reuters) - In the shadow of disused Soviet-era factories in Minsk, a street lined with eclectic bars, art galleries and yoga studios has become a haven from the vigilant eyes of the Belarussian authorities.  This place is like an island,  said Yegor, 21, who works at  popular bar Hooligan.  It s the street of freedom.  The government of President Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for the past 23 years and has boasted that he is  the last and only dictator in Europe  ,has little tolerance for any opposition. A powerful police force and feared state security  keep citizens in check. But police patrols are rare in Oktyabrskaya, partly due to its location on an out-of-the-way peninsula in a bend of the river Svislach. When the first restaurant opened there in 2012, few visitors came but now it ranks among the most fashionable quarters of Minsk.  Such is the growing popularity of that Oktyabrskaya that investors such as Belgazprombank, a subsidiary of state-owned Russian lender Gazprombank, have big plans for the district. Earlier this year the bank purchased part of a factory there and intends to turn it into a gallery, restaurant and theater complex. The manufacturing sector has not entirely abandoned Oktyabrskaya - one  machine-making factory named after the 1917 October Revolution (MZOR) still operates there. Financial difficulties prompted state-owned MZOR to lease or sell some of its facilities to Oktyabrskaya s developers, but the firm still maintains some production with a reduced workforce. Mikhail, who has worked at the factory for 42 years, said he approves of the influx of new  hipster  businesses.  The street has come back to life,  he said. Oktyabrskaya s long-term future ultimately depends on the authorities good favor, cultural analyst Maksim Zhbankov said.  For now they tolerate it. But I can t say that someone won t turn up tomorrow and say they ve decided to tear it all down,  he said. ",

        "title": "Despite derision, Britain's PM May might well be able to carry on... for now",
        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - It was meant to silence her critics, but by pledging to lead the Conservative Party into the next election, British Prime Minister Theresa May instead unleashed a wave of derision from her foes. Still, with no challenger in sight and a party wary of a leadership fight, the 60-year-old prime minister is probably safe for now. The London Evening Standard, now edited by George Osborne, the Conservative sacked by May as finance minister when she became prime minister last year, described her pledge to run again as  Like the Living Dead in a second-rate horror film .  The premiership of Theresa May staggers on oblivious. This was not supposed to be in the script.  Others chimed in.  Party grandee Michael Heseltine, who was also sacked as a government adviser by May for rebelling over Britain s planned exit from the European Union, deadpanned:  I don t think she s got a long term.  And another critic, Nicky Morgan, who lost her position as education minister when May entered power after the Brexit referendum last year, said it would be difficult for May to lead the Conservatives into the next election due in 2022.  We have got to think about how we renew our franchise,  she told the BBC.  But many Conservatives kept silent.  After being bruised this year when May called an early election only to see her party lose its parliamentary majority, several said keeping the party in power was the main priority. And with no one willing to challenge May, it made more sense to keep her as leader to guide Britain through what could become a messy Brexit.   There are people who are fed up and hurt after the election, and there s muttering, but not a lot of them are muttering publicly. The loudest ones are those who have no chance of getting big jobs,  a veteran party member said.  But no one is putting their hand up to take over. There s no appetite from any of the big players ... Her future is all about Brexit.   Asked during a visit to Japan whether she wanted to lead the Conservative Party into the next election, May said:  Yes ... I m here for the long term and it s crucial, what me and my government are about is not just delivering on Brexit, we are delivering a brighter future for the United Kingdom.   I m not a quitter,  she said. She hoped to silence weeks of media reports that she could leave office as early as the annual party conference in October, an event where political careers have been made or broken in the past. But instead of increasing her authority, damaged by the June election, she attracted derision from critics in her own party as well as the opposition. The Labour Party was quick to accuse May of  deluding herself .  Theresa May leads a zombie government,  said Jon Trickett, a senior member of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn s team.  The sooner the public has the chance to vote out her and her government the better for our country s future.  But it is the threat from Labour, which has seen its standing in the polls increase since the election, that in part might keep May in her position for longer than some think. Few Conservatives dare risk doing anything that might trigger an early parliamentary election and hand a chance of victory to Corbyn. Also, despite several leading Conservatives thought to be eyeing her job, none appears willing to step in now when Britain is engaged in difficult talks to leave the European Union, which officials say are making little or no progress. The veteran party member, who discussed May s prospects on condition of anonymity, said he thought May was sincere in pledging to stay on until the next election, despite the chorus of calls from foes within the party for her to step aside.  She told the truth. She s up for staying on. But it all depends on Brexit,  the party member said.  If she comes out of it with jobs up, and is seen to have told the EU to get off and prospects are good ... well you can go hero to zero and vice versa.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. District Court judge ruled on Monday that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration must allow access to abortion for two pregnant teenagers who are in the country illegally, escalating a high-profile legal fight. Judge Tanya Chutkan put her order on hold, however, to give the U.S. Justice Department time to appeal her ruling.  The Justice Department filed its notice of appeal shortly afterward to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The judge\u2019s temporary restraining order marked the latest chapter in a legal dispute with the Trump administration over whether minors who are illegal immigrants have the right to seek an abortion during their detention. The issue was ignited by a 17-year-old who petitioned the court in October to have an abortion, and ultimately had the procedure over the Trump administration\u2019s objections.  In that instance, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled on Oct. 24 that the teen could have an abortion immediately, rejecting the administration\u2019s opposition. The two 17-year-olds in the latest legal action, known to the court as Jane Roe and Jane Poe, requested abortions, but the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement has refused to allow them access to the procedure. In her ruling, Chutkan wrote that the girls\u2019  \u201cconstitutional right to decide whether to carry their pregnancies to term\u201d needed to be preserved.  She also noted they were likely to succeed on the legal merits of their case, based on the prior ruling in the higher court. \u201cWe are deeply disappointed in the decision to grant a temporary restraining order that will compel HHS to facilitate abortions for minors when they are not medically necessary,\u201d a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. \u201cA pregnant minor who has entered the country illegally has the option to voluntarily depart to her home country or identify a suitable sponsor.\u00a0HHS-funded facilities that provide temporary shelter and care for unaccompanied alien minors should not become way stations for these children to get taxpayer-facilitated abortions.\u201d  ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - The U.S wind energy industry on Friday cheered a Senate tax proposal that, unlike the House version unveiled last week, preserves the tax credit that helps wind farms compete with plants fired by fossil fuels. The Senate plan brought relief to an industry that has spent the last week warning lawmakers on Capitol Hill that changes to the credit would put $50 billion in planned investment at risk. However, if the House and Senate pass their differing proposals on the Republicans\u2019 broad tax-cut plan, a House-Senate committee will need to reconcile the differences and both chambers will have to approve the resulting compromise legislation, so it is too soon to know if the tax overhaul will ultimately preserve the wind energy credit. MidAmerican Energy said on Thursday that if the bill passed as the House proposed, the Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) unit could be forced to cancel $4.3 billion of wind investments in Iowa, affecting 400 jobs and prompting the loss of $10 million a year in property tax and landowner payments. The wind industry\u2019s production tax credit was extended by Congress in 2015 and awards a credit for every kilowatt-hour of energy produced from wind projects. Investors and project developers had banked on the stability of the policy, which is scheduled to phase out by 2020, in planning their investments. \u201cThe Senate tax reform bill keeps a promise to America\u2019s more than 100,000 wind energy workers and restores the confidence of businesses pouring billions of dollars into rural America,\u201d Tom Kiernan, Chief Executive of the American Wind Energy Association trade group said in a statement. Republican Senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa, John Thune of South Dakota and Dean Heller of Nevada and others were opposed to changes in the tax credit, the AWEA said. ",

        "text": "FRANKFURT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some Democratic members of the U.S. Congress have renewed efforts to find possible links between banks such as Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia. Investigations are being conducted in the United States into possible collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign team and Russia during the presidential election campaign in 2016. The White House and the Kremlin have denied there was any interference in the election. Maxine Waters, ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, told reporters she had filed a resolution of inquiry demanding the U.S. Treasury Secretary hand over documents in his possession, \u201crelating to President Trump\u2019s financial connections to Russia, certain illegal financial schemes, and related information\u201d. The resolution asked for any records of loans or credit from a number of banks - including Deutsche Bank and Russian lenders Sberbank (SBER.MM) and Gazprombank (GZPRI.MM) - to Trump, and 22 of his closest associates, including family members and top White House and campaign advisers. Specifically, the group is seeking documents that may have been unearthed by the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that could show any ties between Trump\u2019s finances and Russia. A resolution of inquiry is a legislative tool by which the House can request information from the administration. Waters filed the resolution with the Financial Services Committee, which now has 14 legislative days to address it, either by debating it or voting it down.  If the committee, chaired and dominated by Republicans, ignores the resolution, it could head to the floor of the broader House. Waters and four other colleagues have been especially interested in learning more from Deutsche Bank, which government ethics disclosures list as one of Trump\u2019s biggest lenders. Deutsche Bank\u2019s lawyers have rejected requests for information, citing privacy laws. Waters asked Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen at a hearing on Wednesday whether the U.S. central bank had uncovered anything about Trump in its Deutsche regulatory work. Yellen said the Fed had not looked into it. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is considering shifting press secretary Sean Spicer away from the daily spokesman job and into a new communications role but no such move is believed imminent, a senior White House official said on Monday. Spicer has been a frequent target of criticism for his performance at the White House lectern during daily news briefings, although President Donald Trump has stood by him through a variety of controversies. Spicer, who was the Republican National Committee\u2019s senior strategist during the presidential campaign last year, is currently doing double duty as press secretary and communications director after the previous communications director, Michael Dubke, resigned May 30. The senior White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said discussions about some changes in the communications department have been going on for some time. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything is imminent,\u201d the official said. \u201cNo decisions have been made. There is nothing definitive.\u201d Trump has privately vented to aides on occasion about the communications team and the need to have more people defending him on television. The White House has been looking at ways to improve on this front. \u201cWe have sought input from many people as we look to expand our communications operation. As he did in the beginning, Sean Spicer is managing both the communications and press office,\u201d said White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders. Spicer has been doing fewer briefings and not as many of them before the TV cameras in recent weeks as he and his team have adjusted to Trump\u2019s tendency to be his own spokesman through his tweets and public comments. He and his team have also stopped commenting on a special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling into last year\u2019s presidential election. On Monday, Spicer conducted an off-camera session with reporters. Sanders has been Spicer\u2019s stand-in at the lectern on several occasions and would likely be considered a potential successor to Spicer. But Trump has also been intrigued in the past by the possibility of hiring conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham as his press secretary. ",

        "title": "Germany says NATO concerned about Trump 'obsolete' remark",
        "text": "BRUSSELS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s Foreign Minister said on Monday that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s comments that NATO was obsolete had aroused concern across the 28-member alliance. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, speaking after a meeting with alliance Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels, said Trump\u2019s remarks contradicted views expressed by designated Defense Secretary James Mattis. He spoke also of \u201camazement\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken today not only with EU foreign ministers but NATO foreign ministers as well and can report that the signals are that there\u2019s been no easing of tensions,\u201d Steinmeier told reporters when asked about Trump\u2019s interview with Bild newspaper and the Times of London. \u201cObviously the comments from President-elect Trump, that he views NATO as obsolete, were viewed with anxiety,\u201d he said. Trump, who is due to be sworn in as president on Friday, said NATO was obsolete because it had not defended against terrorist attacks.  He said also he had always had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, but criticized her 2015 decision to allow in a wave of a million migrants as a \u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d that opened the door to terrorist attacks. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for Trump to weigh directly into the politics of another country by his remarks. \u201cHe will have to speak to that, as of Friday he is responsible for that relationship.\u201d NATO has been seen since the 1950s as the keystone of western European defenses, extending its zone of activity in the post-Cold War period to the borders of Russia - much to Russia\u2019s chagrin. The alliance\u2019s founding treaty commits members to consider an attack on any one state as an attack on all. A Kremlin spokesman said he agreed with Trump that NATO, characterized by Russian officials as a hostile remnant of the Cold War, was obsolete. Germany\u2019s transatlantic coordinator, Juergen Hardt, told Reuters he did not expect Congress to allow Washington to give up its leadership role in NATO. He said key U.S. lawmakers, including Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, had told him several weeks ago they expected Washington to remain a reliable partner in the 28-nation bloc, and he did not expect Trump to reverse the deployment of 4,000 U.S. troops to Poland. Norbert Roettgen, head of Germany\u2019s foreign affairs committee, said Germany should fight to restore Western unity. \u201cEurope is not able to replace the security role of the United States so there is a lot at stake - the very foundations of liberal order internationally and European security. And for that we should fight because it is our very existential interest,\u201d Roettgen told Reuters. Trump repeated criticism of NATO members that fail to meet spend at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense. Germany is working to gradually boost its military spending, Defence Ministry spokesman Jens Flosdorff told a news conference. Merkel in November said she could not promise the NATO target would be met \u201cin the near future.\u201d ",

        "title": "Argentina Congress passes pension reform after protests, clashes",
        "text": "BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina s Congress passed a reform to the pension system on Tuesday, after days of demonstrations by the bill s opponents and violent clashes between protesters and police. The measure is central to President Mauricio Macri s plan to slash the fiscal deficit and attract investment. It paves the way for further market-friendly legislation that his Cambiemos, or  Let s Change  coalition hopes to pass in extraordinary congressional sessions before the end of the year. The law changes the formula used to calculate benefits by linking them to consumer prices instead of tax income and wage hikes. The government says that will make benefits more predictable and sustainable, and they will still increase by more than inflation next year.   This formula guarantees that over the next few years, retirees will never lose against a jump in inflation,  said Macri, who took office in December 2015 after more than a decade of populist rule. Macri tweaked his proposal, pledging a one-time bonus payment to the neediest retirees, after clashes last Thursday derailed congressional debate. Still, the measure generated fierce criticism from opposition lawmakers and labor unions, who say it will hurt retirees. The debate prompted demonstrations on Monday. Thousands took to the streets of the capital Buenos Aires and around the country, banging pots and pans and blaring car horns. Stone-throwing protesters confronted police, who responded with water canon, rubber bullets and tear gas. Dozens were injured.  All these changes generate discomfort, but they are necessary,  Macri said after the measure passed the lower chamber of deputies 127-117, with two abstentions, following an all-night debate session. The Senate approved the proposal last month. The government will now press congressional votes on a tax code overhaul and a deal with provinces to limit spending, Macri told reporters. Economists, noting that inflation expectations are lower, said linking benefits to consumer prices would lower spending by around 0.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) next year.  But savings from the pension reform will finance transfers from the national treasury to provinces as part of the fiscal pact, said economist Ariel Barraud of the Argentina Fiscal Analysis Institute in Cordoba, Argentina.  Almost all of the savings obtained from the pension formula change will go to compensate the fiscal deal,  Barraud told Reuters by phone.   Argentina s government is aiming to cut the deficit to 3.2 percent of GDP from 4.2 percent currently.  Cambiemos lacks a majority in Congress despite a strong performance in October s legislative midterm. Dozens of votes from opposition lawmakers were needed to pass the pension measure. Other leaders in South America have had a harder time implementing similar business-friendly agendas.  In Peru, measures meant to boost growth have stalled as President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has fought efforts to remove him over his ties to scandal-plagued Brazilian builder Odebrecht. Brazil s efforts at its own pension reform were recently pushed back until next year. Despite passage of the pension measure, Macri s agenda still faces substantial popular skepticism.   They are encroaching upon the rights of society s most vulnerable,  opposition lawmaker Facundo Moyano said during the congressional debate. ",

        "title": "Fund managers seek stocks benefiting from Democratic gains in 2018 U.S. elections",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The surprise victory by Democrats in Tuesday\u2019s Alabama election for a U.S. senator is prompting fund managers to prepare for more losses by the Republican party in the 2018 mid-term Congressional elections.  Fund managers from Federated Investors, Wells Fargo, James Funds and LPL Financial are among those that are moving into the shares of retailers, banks, industrials and technology firms that may benefit from strong global economic growth abroad and tax cuts for high income wage earners at home, even if the Democratic party makes gains in next year\u2019s elections.  With a strong economy, continuing deregulation by the administration of President Trump, and the benefits of corporate tax cuts expected to be passed by the Republican-led Congress in coming days, cyclical companies ranging from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to Allstate Corp (ALL.N) will outperform as long as Washington stays out of the way, according to fund managers.  \u201cTax reform was the big thing from an economic perspective, and if I\u2019ve got it then I\u2019ve got it. If this (next year\u2019s election) makes it harder for Republicans to pass an immigration bill or trade restrictions then that\u2019s even better\u201d because it reduces threats to global economic growth, said Steven Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York, which has $363 billion in assets under management.  As a result, Chiavarone is holding on to large-capitalization technology stocks like Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Amazon, despite each company\u2019s stock gaining more than 45 percent for the year to date, because he expects them to be the largest beneficiaries of the global economic expansion.  \u201cYou are going to have more money in the pockets of both consumers and of corporations, and these companies are most exposed to where that money will be spent,\u201d he said. Historically, the U.S. stock market has done well during periods when opposing political parties have control of the presidency and at least one house of Congress. This time, however, the more influential factor looks to be the strength of the global economy.  In the U.S, the economy grew at its fastest pace in three years during the third quarter this year, while the economy of the eurozone is on pace for its largest expansion in a decade. In October, the International Monetary Fund raised its outlook for global economic growth to a rate of 3.7 percent in 2018, helping to push emerging market stocks up to six-year highs.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t had anything like this on a global growth scale since 2010,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, which has $560 billion in assets under management. \u201cAgainst that backdrop, more gridlock in Washington is not a bad thing, because you won\u2019t have any extreme moves one way or another.\u201d Detrick expects cyclical value stocks, especially financials and industrials, to outpace the market in the year ahead as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates and corporations start to increase their capital expenditures.  Financial stocks slightly outperformed the broad market on Wednesday following the victory in the Alabama election by Democrat Doug Jones, with the Financial Select SPDR Fund (XLF.P), a measure of financial companies in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index, gaining 0.3 percentage points while the index as a whole was little changed.  The move to invest in stocks that might benefit from gridlock in Washington D.C., if the Democrats regain at least one house in Congress next year, is a reversal from a year ago, when fund managers piled into infrastructure, defense and small-capitalization stocks in anticipation of Republican legislative victories in the 2016 elections.   Dubbed the \u2018Trump Trade\u2019 last year, the move helped push the U.S. dollar up to multi-year highs and sent the broad S&P 500 index up more than 10 percent between November and March this year. Now, however, fund managers are looking at companies that can benefit even if Republicans are not able to legislate in Congress.  Barry James, portfolio manager of the $3 billion James Balanced Golden Rainbow fund, is also moving into financial stocks such as Allstate and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) because he expects the Trump administration to continue to reduce regulations in the industry, a policy that it can continue if Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress.  At the same time, he is increasing his position in retail companies such as Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) that get the majority of their revenues in the U.S. and are well-positioned to benefit from the Republican-led corporate tax cut likely to be passed soon.  He expects that Democrats will win at least at least one house of Congress in 2018, limiting the impact of Washington on the stock market until the presidential election in 2020.  \u201cIt\u2019s looking more and more like the tax plan will be the one legislative victory that Republicans will have, and there won\u2019t be anything else out of Washington unless it is truly bi-partisan,\u201d he said.

        "text": "(Reuters) - Two reporters and two editors from Breitbart News resigned to protest how the conservative website handled an alleged assault last week on one of the reporters by a senior aide to Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump. Reporter Michelle Fields filed a criminal complaint on Friday against Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, saying he grabbed her arm at a rally on March 8 in Florida with such force that he left bruises. Lewandowski and Trump have denied the accusation. The incident sparked a spat at Breitbart, with journalists accusing management of kowtowing to the Trump campaign. Breitbart published an account on Friday of the incident that raised questions over Fields\u2019 version of events and suggested it was not Lewandowski who grabbed her. According to a report on Saturday on the BuzzFeed news website, Breitbart senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak also ordered staffers in an internal chatroom to stop defending Fields. Fields and editor-at-large Ben Shapiro resigned in response to that late on Sunday. National security correspondent Jordan Schachtel and editor Jarrett Stepman resigned on Monday, according to a letter by them that was posted to Twitter, in which they accused the news site of becoming a propaganda arm for the Trump campaign.

We wish each of them the best in their future endeavors.\u201d He was referring to Kurt Bardella, who resigned as Breitbart\u2019s spokesman last week.

        "title": "Obama to propose $200 million to battle Islamist militants in Africa",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is proposing about $200 million in new military spending to confront Islamist militants in north and west Africa, U.S. defense officials said ahead of Tuesday\u2019s budget rollouts for the next fiscal year. U.S. officials declined to specify to which nations the funding would be directed. The disclosure comes as the United States and its allies discuss ways to halt the spread of Islamic State in Libya and elsewhere in Africa from its self-declared caliphate in Syria and Iraq. The proposed increase in U.S. defense spending for north and west Africa is a component of a larger $7.5 billion Pentagon request for fiscal year 2017 to counter Islamic State. \u201cThe marginal increase is on the order of about $200 million associated with north Africa,\u201d one U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to a small group of reporters. Another U.S. defense official told Reuters the funds would also be directed to west Africa. Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force General Paul Selva said the new funding was aimed at addressing threats from militant groups across Africa, including al Shabaab in the east, Boko Haram in the west, and Islamic State in Libya. \u201cThe monies that we\u2019ve put into the budget to address those threats in Africa are to be able to work with indigenous forces as well as partner forces to get at those three particular threats and others that might emerge,\u201d Selva said. U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter last week announced his intention to ramp up spending to counter Islamic State as he unveiled the broad details of Obama\u2019s proposed $582.7 billion defense budget. A key part of the $7.5 billion would go to munitions. Carter said the United States has used so many smart bombs and laser-guided rockets in Iraq and Syria that it is running low and needs to invest $1.8 billion for 45,000 more. The Air Force budget includes about 4,500 small diameter bombs, doubling the previous year\u2019s purchase. It also calls for  more than 30,000 Boeing Co (BA.N) Joint Direct Attack Munition tail kits, which turn unguided bombs into all-weather smart munitions using GPS guidance systems, compared to about 22,000 the previous year. The Navy is slated to buy 100 Hellfire missiles built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), with the Air Force planning to buy around 280. The U.S. officials also said some of the $7.5 billion would go toward training and equipping Iraqi forces and fighters in Syria to counter Islamic State. Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, warned on Monday of the group\u2019s expansion to Libya, Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula, Nigeria, Algeria and elsewhere. The United States has a limited permanent military presence in Africa, largely centered on a U.S. base in Djibouti.  Islamic State forces have attacked Libya\u2019s oil infrastructure and taken control of the city of Sirte, exploiting a power vacuum in which two rival governments have been battling for supremacy. The Pentagon has said planning is underway to confront the group in Libya, although significant political hurdles could slow any new campaign by the U.S. and its allies there. Carter will meet with allies in Brussels this week to discuss ways to accelerate the campaign against Islamic State.  ",

        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of 30 Illinois House members on Tuesday threw their support behind efforts in the Senate to craft a bill package aimed at ending the state\u2019s historic budget impasse. \u201cWe ask the senators from both parties to pass the best negotiated package they can, and then we will take up their work in the House,\u201d the group said in a statement.  The package, which includes tax hikes, pension changes and a local property tax freeze, stalled in the Democratic-led Senate in March, when most Republicans withdrew their support. John Patterson, a spokesman for Senate President John Cullerton, said on Tuesday both sides are \u201ctrading ideas in trying to find agreement.\u201d Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete budget due to a standoff between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers face a May 31 deadline to pass budget bills with simple majority votes. The bipartisan House statement surfaced after House Speaker Michael Madigan on Monday urged Governor Bruce Rauner to restart budget negotiations and appointed four top Democrats from his chamber to work on a deal. Meanwhile, the Chicago-based Civic Federation, a nonpartisan government finance watchdog, released a report on Tuesday calling for an end to piecemeal funding that has kept the nation\u2019s fifth-largest state operating. \u201cThe governor and General Assembly need to end this unacceptable stalemate by passing and enacting a comprehensive plan,\u201d Civic Federation President Laurence Msall said in a statement. \u201cCherry-picking certain areas of government to fund while pledging to work toward a complete budget sometime in the abstract future has not and will not end the crisis and in fact is making it worse.\u201d Illinois\u2019 reliance on continuing appropriations, court-ordered spending and partial budgets has ballooned an unpaid bill backlog from $9.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2016 to more than $13 billion in fiscal 2017. Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza told a Senate committee on Tuesday that late payment penalties owed to vendors total about $800 million. Eleni Demertzis, a Rauner spokeswoman, said the governor continues to push for \u201ca truly balanced budget with structural reforms.\u201d  Major rating agencies, which have pushed Illinois down the credit scale six times since Rauner took office in January 2015, have indicated the state\u2019s triple-B bond ratings could fall closer to junk in the absence of a fiscal fix.

        "text": "PRATICA DI MARE, Italy (Reuters) - The United Nations began bringing African refugees to Italy from Libya on Friday, evacuating them from detention centers whose conditions have been condemned by humanitarian groups as inhumane.  Hundreds of thousands of migrants have fled conflict or poverty at home and are now trapped in Libya, where they had hoped to pay people smugglers for passage to Europe via Italy. It is the first time the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Libya has evacuated refugees directly to Europe. An Italian C-130 military plane landed at an airport south the capital carrying 110 women and children, and a second flight is expected to bring more than 50 people later in the day. The African migrants, including many small children, were covered in blankets or bundled in coats as they disembarked from the plane on a chilly evening.  We really hope other countries will follow the same path,  Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR s Special Envoy for the Central Mediterranean, said in a statement after the first plane arrived.    Some of those evacuated suffered tremendously and were held captive in inhumane conditions while in Libya. Five of these women gave birth while in detention, with only the very limited medical assistance,  Cochetel said. The UNHCR estimates about 18,000 people are being held in detention centers for immigrants that are controlled by the Tripoli government and it aims to evacuate as many as 10,000 next year. [nL8N1OJ3EG] Italy s Catholic Church will house many of the new arrivals in shelters across the country, Church charity Caritas said, as the migrants from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen go through the country s asylum request process.  Migrant arrivals to Italy have fallen by two-thirds since July from the same period last year after officials working for the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli persuaded human smugglers in the city of Sabratha to stop boats leaving. Italy is also bolstering the Libyan coast guard s ability to turn back boats.[nL8N1OE34J] Italy s move to open a safe corridor for some of the migrants follows criticism by rights groups who have condemned the country s efforts to block migrants in Libya in exchange for aid, training and equipment to fight smuggling.[nL8N1NK77C]   This should be a point of pride for Italians,  Interior Minister Marco Minniti told reporters on the tarmac.  This is the just beginning. We will continue to try to open this humanitarian corridor.  Migrant smuggling has flourished since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, with more than 600,000 making the perilous journey across the central Mediterranean in four years.  Tens of thousands of migrants are estimated to be detained by smugglers, and the African Union says that as many as 700,000 migrants are in Libya. The UNHCR has registered more than 44,000 as refugees and asylum seekers. The UNHCR classifies Friday s arrivals as  vulnerable  refugees, which means they are children, victims of abuse, women, the elderly or have disabilities. ",

        "title": "Alleged Kenyan police killing of girl, baby in vote-related violence likely to reach court: official",
        "text": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s police monitor said on Monday investigations into the alleged killings by police of a girl and a baby in election-related violence were complete, and a spokesman said the case would probably end up in court. Kenyan police frequently face accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings from civilians and rights groups, but officers are rarely charged and almost never convicted.  Human rights groups say at least 66 people have died in bloodshed associated with the August election, which was later voided by the Supreme Court, and in unrest surrounding the re-run of the presidential vote last month.  Stephanie Moraa, an 8-year-old girl in the Nairobi slum of Mathare, died after being hit by a stray bullet as police fired to disperse protesters on Aug. 12, the day after election results were announced. And the parents of six-month-old Samantha Pendo said she was teargassed and clubbed by police who invaded their home in Kisumu looking for protesters.  On Monday, the government-funded but civilian-run Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) said it had forwarded its findings and recommendations to the director of public prosecutions  for review and direction . Asked on Monday what IPOA had recommended to the prosecutor s office regarding the two deaths, spokesman Dennis Oketch said:  It s a matter which will most likely end up in court. We don t want to give any information that can become prejudicial. We will wait for the [prosecutor s] review.  IPOA s statement did not specify if it had identified suspects in the two deaths. It did not mention any other investigations into election-related violence.  It has however, completed another investigation into alleged police beatings at a demonstration in September at Kenya s oldest university that sparked opposition anger at what they see as a pattern of police brutality.  IPOA said it had recommended to a police service commission that it take  stern disciplinary action against the responsible Commander . It had also forwarded the investigation file to the prosecutor s office, the statement read. Shortly after the August election, IPOA said it was fast-tracking investigations of all deaths and injuries for which the police were alleged by rights groups to be responsible.  Kenyan police dispute those accounts. The National Police Service described a report last month by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International on 33 deaths in Nairobi during the crackdown as  totally misleading and based on falsehoods . Despite its history of police brutality, Kenya is an economic and transport hub in East Africa and important Western ally against militant Islam that receives substantial financial support for its security services from international donors, including the United States and Britain. The IPOA was set up in 2011 after the killings of around 1,200 people in violence following the disputed 2007 election. It has received more than 9,000 complaints of police brutality and corruption since then.  Last year, it secured its first conviction, of two police officers sentenced for the death of a 14-year-old girl shot dead during a house raid in 2014. A survey last year by the non-profit International Police Science Association ranked Kenya s police force as the 125th worst-performing out of 127 national police forces studied. Only forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria did worse, measured on factors such as  process  and  legitimacy.  ",

        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO allies on Tuesday welcomed President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to commit more forces to Afghanistan, as part of a new U.S. strategy he said would require more troops and funding from America\u2019s partners. Having run for the White House last year on a pledge to withdraw swiftly from Afghanistan, Trump reversed course on Monday and promised a stepped-up military campaign against  Taliban insurgents, saying: \u201cOur troops will fight to win\u201d.  U.S. officials said he had signed off on plans to send about 4,000 more U.S. troops to add to the roughly 8,400 now deployed in Afghanistan. But his speech did not define benchmarks for successfully ending the war that began with the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, and which he acknowledged had required an  \u201cextraordinary sacrifice of blood and treasure\u201d. \u201cWe will ask our NATO allies and global partners to support our new strategy, with additional troops and funding increases in line with our own. We are confident they will,\u201d Trump said. That comment signaled he would further increase pressure on U.S. partners who have already been jolted by his repeated demands to step up their contributions to NATO and his description of the alliance as \u201cobsolete\u201d - even though, since taking office, he has said this is no longer the case. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement: \u201cNATO remains fully committed to Afghanistan and I am looking forward to discussing the way ahead with (Defense) Secretary (James) Mattis and our Allies and international partners.\u201d NATO has 12,000 troops in Afghanistan, and 15 countries have pledged more, Stoltenberg said. Britain, a leading NATO member, called the U.S. commitment \u201cvery welcome\u201d. \u201cIn my call with Secretary Mattis yesterday we agreed that despite the challenges, we have to stay the course in Afghanistan to help build up its fragile democracy and reduce the terrorist threat to the West,\u201d Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said. Germany, which has borne the brunt of Trump\u2019s criticism over  the scale of its defense spending, also welcomed the new U.S. plan. \u201cOur continued commitment is necessary on the path to stabilizing the country,\u201d a government spokeswoman said. In June, European allies had already pledged more troops but had not given details on numbers, waiting for the Trump administration to outline its strategy for the region.Nearly 16 years after the U.S.-led invasion - a response to the Sept. 11 attacks which were planned by al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden from Afghanistan - the country is still struggling with weak central government and a Taliban insurgency. Trump said he shared the frustration of the American people who were \u201cweary of war without victory\u201d, but a hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum for groups like Islamic State and al Qaeda to fill.

        "text": "HERZLIYA, Israel (Reuters) - The Israeli intelligence minister said on Monday that President Bashar al-Assad was ready to permit Iran to set up military bases in Syria that would pose a long-term threat to neighboring Israel. While formally neutral on the six-year-old Syrian civil war, Israel worries that Assad s recent gains have given his Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah allies a foothold on its northern front. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has lobbied Russia, Assad s most powerful backer, and the United States to curb the Iranian presence in Syria   as well as hinting that Israel could launch preemptive strikes against its arch-foe there. In July, Moscow ratified a deal under which Damascus allowed the Russian air base in Syria s Latakia Province to remain for almost half a century. Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz said Iran could soon gain similar rights.  In these very days, Assad and Iran are nearing the signing of a long-term agreement that would anchor Iran s military presence in Syria, resembling the agreement that was signed between Assad and the Russians,  Katz told a security conference hosted by IDC Herzliya, a university near Tel Aviv.   The significance in terms of the danger and the threat against Israel - and not just against Israel, but also many countries in the region - is of the utmost clarity.   Katz did not elaborate on the source of his information or give any further details about the purported negotiations. The Iranian Foreign Ministry declined to comment and Syrian officials could not be reached. Katz said the plan was for an Iranian naval port, bases for Iran s air and ground forces, and  tens of thousands of Shiite militiamen being brought in from various countries  to fight alongside their Iranian and Hezbollah co-religionists in Syria. Iran s presence in Syria, and efforts to bolster Hezbollah in Lebanon, are expected to feature in Netanyahu s address to the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 19.        ",

        "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - France reacted cautiously on Friday to U.S. evidence which allegedly proved Iran supplied weapons to Houthi militia in Yemen, saying it was still studying information at its disposal and the United Nations had yet to draw any conclusions. The United States on Thursday presented for the first time pieces of what it said were Iranian weapons supplied to the Houthis, describing it as conclusive evidence that Tehran was violating U.N. resolutions.  The arms included charred remnants of what the Pentagon said was an Iranian-made short-range ballistic missile fired from Yemen on Nov. 4 at King Khaled International Airport outside Saudi Arabia s capital Riyadh, as well as a drone and an anti-tank weapon recovered in Yemen by the Saudis. When asked whether Paris believed that evidence was irrefutable, foreign ministry deputy spokesman Alexandre Giorgini declined to respond directly.  The United Nations secretariat has not, at this stage, drawn any conclusions. France continues to examine the information at its disposal,  he said. Tensions between Iran and France have increased in recent weeks after President Emmanuel Macron said Tehran should be less aggressive in the region and clarify its ballistic missile program. Giorgini said France remained concerned by Iran s ballistic missile program and urged it to abide fully by U.N. Security Council resolution 2231. Resolution 2231, which enshrined the landmark nuclear deal with world powers, calls on Iran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs, including launches using such technology. It stops short of explicitly barring such activity. France s foreign minister is due in Washington on Monday to in part to discuss Iran and will travel to Tehran at the start of January.

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - If Mitt Romney wanted to ignite a debate about Donald Trump\u2019s suitability for the White House, he succeeded, at least on social media. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, lambasted Trump in a speech on Thursday in Salt Lake City, Utah, calling him \u201ca phony, a fraud\u201d and saying it is his \u201cvery brand of anger that has led other nations into the abyss.\u201d The speech was the latest illustration of how badly many mainstream Republican leaders want to stop Trump, the clear front-runner, from becoming his party\u2019s nominee in November\u2019s election to succeed President Barack Obama. Twitter users posted about Romney roughly 38 times per second following the speech, according to Zoomph, the social media analytics firm. Romney\u2019s sentiment score, a measure of how positively users discuss a topic, was slightly higher than Trump\u2019s following the speech, according to the firm. \u201cMitt Romney\u201d quickly became one of the top-trending topics on Twitter in the United States. In a period of about four hours after the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s speech, there were roughly 529,000 tweets about Romney on Twitter, according to the social media site\u2019s own metrics. Trump\u2019s response, a barrage of put-downs, also generated social media attention. During a campaign rally in Maine, Trump said Romney had begged him for an endorsement when he was running for the White House in 2012. Trump\u2019s comments included what many on social media perceived to be a crude sexual joke. \u201cI could have said \u2018Mitt, drop to your knees,\u2019 he would have dropped to his knees,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIs this a new @realDonaldTrump campaign slogan? \u2018Drop to Your Knees, America ... and they did,\u2019\u201d tweeted Carl Spry (@CarlSpry). \u201cHis secret to getting so many endorsements?\u201d. Romney said later he would not have accepted Trump\u2019s endorsement four years ago if Trump had spoken as he does now. \u201cIf Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK, Muslims, Mexicans, disabled, I would NOT have accepted his endorsement,\u201d Romney tweeted (@MittRomney), referring to the white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan. In his speech slamming both Trump\u2019s policy proposals and his style, Romney did not endorse any of the candidates remaining in the Republican race. But one of them, Ohio Governor John Kasich (@JohnKasich), tweeted his support, saying \u201cWell said, @MittRomney.\u201d A photo of the presidential Oval Office accompanied the tweet, with the caption \u201cThe One Who Works Here Should Make Us Proud.\u201d Other presidential candidates remained quiet on Twitter, but Republican South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley offered her support for Romney. \u201cA brilliant speech by @MittRomney. No one can ever question his love for our party and our country. #TrueLeadership #MittRomney,\u201d she (@nikkihaley) tweeted.  Haley has endorsed Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida,  for the Republican nomination.

        "text": "Juba (Reuters) - Twenty-seven people were killed when rebels attacked government forces in South Sudan, a local government official said on Thursday.  Three government soldiers and 24 fighters loyal to rebel leader Riek Machar were killed in the fighting in Southern Liech state on Wednesday, Peter Makouth Malual, the region s information minister,  told Reuters.  Rebel spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel did not have a death toll for the fighting. He told Reuters he was trying to reach commanders on the ground.  As expected, the onset of the dry season has led to fresh fighting between the army and rebels.  Diplomats and analysts told Reuters earlier this month it was unlikely peace talks would resume to end a war that has already killed tens of thousands and created Africa s largest refugee crisis [L3N1NG5D4]. Crude oil output has been slashed by two-thirds to around 130,000 barrels per day by the violence.  South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after protracted bloodshed, then fell into civil war in late 2013, with troops loyal to President Salva Kiir fighting those backing Machar, a former vice president Kiir had sacked.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday said China recognized it could not sustain an export-driven growth model indefinitely but that it would take time to change. Speaking to state governors at the White House, Obama urged them to press the U.S. Congress to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact to boost U.S. exports in a region where China is \u201cthe 800-pound gorilla.\u201d Obama said it was tempting for China to try to solve its short-term problems by dumping state-subsidized goods into the U.S. market but said his administration had made clear to China that would not work, Obama said. \u201cThey recognize that they can\u2019t forever sustain an export-driven growth model, but it\u2019s going to take some time and it\u2019s tempting for them to solve short-term problems by just dumping a bunch of state-subsidized goods into the U.S. market,\u201d Obama said in response to a question raising concerns about China\u2019s exports of iron ore. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear with them about the fact that that\u2019s not going to work, and we\u2019re going to put in place tools to make sure it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. Obama also said the United States had made clear China needed to have an orderly market-based currency system that did not advantage its companies over their U.S. counterparts. \u201cRight now, frankly, their intervention is to prop up their currency rather than to devalue it, because a lot of people have been nervous about the Chinese economy,\u201d he said. Obama told the governors he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that Congress ultimately will back the 12-nation TPP trade pact, which labor unions oppose because of what Obama called \u201cemotions\u201d about job losses from past trade deals. \u201cOur concern there was that China was the 800-pound gorilla. And if we allowed them to set trade rules out there, American businesses and American workers were going to be cut out,\u201d he said.  Obama said he would have to rely on votes from \u201ca set of strong pro-trade Democrats\u201d in Congress as well as Republicans. But Obama acknowledged that Republicans have also \u201csome concerns along the margins\u201d of the TPP, such as provisions affecting tobacco, and said the campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election has \u201croiled\u201d the debate in both parties. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has said he has \u201csome problems\u201d with the TPP and does not think it should be pursued before the election. ",

Many trees on the forested hills of Balukhali in southern Bangladesh, where the incident took place, have been chopped down to house the massive influx of Rohingya Muslims escaping violence in neighboring Myanmar. Tarpaulin and bamboo shelters have been built on elephant walkways in some areas, sparking environmental concerns, as the country struggles to accommodate an unprecedented number of people. Besides those killed, four refugees from neighboring tents were injured and were in critical condition at Sadar Hospital in Cox s Bazar, the town s additional superintendent of police Afrujul Hoque Totul told Reuters. At the refugee camp, cooking utensils the family had brought from Myanmar lay crushed under a jumble of bamboo sticks and clothes. Abdul Sukoor, 30, whose tent on the edge of the camp was also trampled, said he and his family managed to escape when they heard the screams of other refugees as the elephants approached. He is now moving to a tent further inside the camp, but said he was still worried.  We have to be constantly alert at night,  he said. More than 530,000 refugees from Myanmar have fled to Bangladesh over the last two months since attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts triggered a Myanmar army operation that the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing.

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Half of Britons support a second vote on whether to leave the European Union and a majority think the government may be paying too much money to the EU to open the way to trade talks, according to a new opinion poll.    The poll, published in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, found 50 percent of people supported another vote on the final terms of Britain s exit deal, 34 percent rejected another referendum and 16 percent said they did not know. The newspaper said it was the first major opinion poll since last week s media reports that Britain is preparing to pay about 50 billion euros ($59 billion) to help to move on to talks on a future trade pact with the EU. Mike Smithson, an election analyst who runs the www.politicalbetting.com website and a former Liberal Democrat politician, said on Twitter it was  the first time any pollster has recorded backing  for a second Brexit referendum. Since the referendum in 2016, high profile opponents of Britain s exit - from French President Emmanuel Macron, to former British prime minister Tony Blair and billionaire investor George Soros - have suggested Britain could change its mind and avoid what they say will be disastrous for the British economy. Blair said on Sunday he was trying to reverse Brexit because claims by the leave campaign, such as the National Health Service getting an extra 350 million pounds a week once Britain leaves the EU, have been proved false. Blair told the BBC that the government aims in the Brexit negotiations will fail because it wants to leave the single market, but retain all of the benefits, and voters can change their minds.  It s reversible. It s not done until it s done,  he said.  When the facts change, I think people are entitled to change their mind.  Brexit supporters argue any attempt to halt the exit process would be anti-democratic. According to the Survation poll only 11 percent of voters said Britain should pay 50 billion pounds to quit the EU, while 31 percent said the government should not pay anything at all.   The poll also found 35 percent of those surveyed said they would be worse off financially after Brexit, while 14 percent said they would be better off. The online poll, carried out by research firm Survation, interviewed 1,003 adults in Britain between 30 November and 1 December. Survation said it carries out polls for media organizations including the BBC, Sky News, the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian. The polling agency correctly predicted a narrowing in the vote between the ruling Conservative party and the opposition Labour Party in this summer s general election that resulted in May leading a minority government.

The latest contracts underscored how Doha can use the wealth it has accumulated as the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas to defy some of the largest and wealthiest Arab countries. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade relations with the emirate almost six months ago. They accuse the Qataris of backing terrorism, which Qatar denies.  Our position on this blockade was very clear. Qatar s position was very clear - to resolve this problem, if we saw problems between us and our neighbors - we should be at a table and speak honestly,  Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said at a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron, who has tried to play a mediation role between the sides, was in Doha to discuss how to combat the financing of terrorism at a time when the Middle East is locked in a regional power struggle between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran.  Restoring stability to the Gulf is a priority for us because we have a lot of friends here,  Macron said.  Our wish is that we find a quick resolution to today s situation.  Paris has strong commercial and political ties with Qatar. It has promoted deeper business interests in the country and encouraged Qatari investment in France, where the Gulf state already has assets of about $10 billion. Macron said some 12 billion euros ($14.13 billion) worth of deals were agreed on Thursday. They included Qatar s taking up an option from 2015 to buy 12 more Dassault Aviation-made Rafale fighters, and saying it could purchase a further 36. It has already bought 24 planes for about 6 billion euros, including missiles. It also committed to buying 490 armored vehicles from defense firm Nexter.  Doha has repeatedly called for dialogue with its neighbors, although it has strengthened its military as relations with them have deteriorated. It has secured this year alone military equipment deals with the United States, Russia and Britain.   In total, it amounts to nearly 12 billion euros which was signed today and which underlines the closeness of our economic cooperation,  Macron said. Among other deals signed, Suez SEVI.PA will dredge and clean Qatar s lagoon and a rail consortium of RATP and SNCF will build and operate a metro system in the Qatari capital. Qatar Airways also placed a new order for Airbus A321neo civilian aircraft to replace an earlier A320neo order. The new deal for larger planes is worth an extra $930 million at current list prices for Airbus and involves a switch of engine supplier to a French-American venture co-owned by Safran (SAF.PA)< and General Electric (GE.N).

Security was tight, with authorities on guard from any possible attack by religious extremists who have carried out bombings across the country in recent years.  Today, we are here to offer Eid prayers,  said worshipper Saleem Ahmed at a ceremony in Karachi, Pakistan s largest city.  The security arrangements were very good. May Allah approve our prayers.  Eid al-Adha commemorates the Koranic tale of the Prophet Abraham s willingness to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to Allah, before Allah replaced the son with a ram to be sacrificed instead. A similar story involving Abraham is recounted in the holy books of Judaism and Christianity. It is tradition for those who can afford it to sacrifice domestic animals as a symbol of Abraham s willingness to sacrifice his only son. The result is a booming pre-holiday trade in goats, cows and sheep. In Pakistan alone, nearly 10 million animals, worth more than $3 billion, are slaughtered during the two days of Eid al-Adha, according to the Pakistan Tanners  Association.  We are presenting sacrifices to follow the path of the prophet Abraham. We should not forget our poor and needy Muslim brethren on this occasion,  Karachi resident Mohamad Muzammil said at the prayer ground where cows and goats were being slaughtered. Eid al-Adha marks the end of an annual Hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, which is one of the five pillars of Islam, and should be undertaken by every Muslim who can afford to do so. With a population of about 208 million people, Pakistan is the sixth most-populous country in the world, and has the second largest Muslim population after Indonesia. About 97 percent of Pakistanis are Muslims. ",

        "text": "MONROVIA (Reuters) - Liberia s ruling party, whose candidate finished runner-up in the first round of this month s presidential election, said on Sunday it would back a legal challenge to the result, accusing President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of interfering in the vote.     The extraordinary charge by Unity Party against Johnson Sirleaf, one of its own members, throws into question a second round run-off scheduled for Nov. 7 between its candidate Vice President Joseph Boakai and front-runner George Weah. Unity Party said in a statement that the Oct. 10 poll, meant to usher in Liberia s first democratic transition of power since 1944, was  characterised by massive systematic irregularities and fraud .  The statement, read to reporters by Unity Party Chairman Wilmont Paye, said Johnson Sirleaf had acted inappropriately by meeting privately with elections magistrates before the vote.  Greed has resurfaced in its most callous form, sowing seeds of discord yet again with the intent of disrupting the fragile peace of Liberia,  the party said in its statement.     Unity Party officials said they were supporting a legal challenge by Liberty Party of the third-place candidate Charles Brumskine, which has petitioned the elections commission for a re-run of the first round. The All Liberian Party of businessman Benoni Urey also said on Sunday it was backing the complaint.  It doesn t mean we will not take part in the (run-off),  Augustine Ngafuan, Unity Party s national campaign chairman, told Reuters.  We hope the court can rule before the run-off. If not, we will decide what next to do.  An official from the elections commission said it expected to hear the formal complaint on Monday. The commission s findings can be appealed in the Supreme Court. At Johnson Sirleaf s residence, where she was celebrating her 79th birthday, her spokesman Jerolinmek Piah told reporters that he would comment on the accusations later as he did not want to overshadow the festivities. International observers from the European Union, the Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute have said they saw no major problems with the vote. Unity Party s statement cements a falling out between Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and her party s leadership after 12 years in power that saw the country consolidate a post-war peace but it also drew sharp criticism over alleged corruption and underdevelopment. Boakai has served as Johnson Sirleaf s vice president since the president s inauguration in 2006. However, Johnson Sirleaf declined to endorse him and he distanced himself from the last administration. Weah, a former soccer star in Europe, won the first round with 38.4 percent of the vote to Boakai s 28.8 percent and has momentum heading into the run-off. On Thursday he picked up the endorsement of former warlord Prince Johnson, who won 8 percent of the vote in the first round.  Morluba Morlu, a senior official from Weah s CDC party, said those challenging the result were  opting to stage trouble .  But no matter what they do ... they cannot stop the election of Ambassador Weah,  he added. Weah has been a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.   ",

It is believed to be the work of violent groups already creating incidents in the area,  Pramote Prom-in, a spokesman for regional security forces, told Reuters.  As with most violence in Thailand s deep south, there was no claim of responsibility. The insurgents are fighting for secession from mostly Buddhist Thailand. Until they were annexed in 1909, Thailand s three southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat were  part of an independent Malay Muslim sultanate. ",

        "title": "Trump's Justice No. 2 rebuffs Democrats on Russia probe",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The lawyer who will take control of an investigation into Russian meddling in last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election, if he wins Senate confirmation to become deputy attorney general, rebuffed Democrats\u2019 demands on Tuesday for the appointment of a special prosecutor in the case. Rod Rosenstein, now U.S. Attorney for Maryland, faced tough questioning, especially from Democrats, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on his nomination by President Donald Trump to fill the Justice Department\u2019s No. 2 job. Coming amid persistent questions about ties between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia, Rosenstein\u2019s nomination has catapulted him into the center of an issue that Trump has been unable to put behind him in his first six weeks in office. California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein asked Rosenstein, \u201cDo you support an independent, outside counsel?\u201d He said he could not commit to that approach before learning the facts of the case. \u201cMy view is that I have a responsibility to not take the job conditional on how I [will handle] a particular case,\u201d Rosenstein said. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the politically-charged inquiry last week after admitting he met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak during the campaign. Sessions had previously testified he had no contact with Russian officials. Trump fired national security adviser Michael Flynn last month after disclosures that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Kislyak before Trump took office and then misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trump\u2019s favor. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Democrats at the hearing said only a special prosecutor could ensure that the investigation would be free of pressure from Trump, who has accused officials in former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s administration of trying to discredit him with questions about Russia contacts. Trump called frequently during his campaign for improved relations with Russia. U.S.-Russian relations have been deeply strained in recent years over Moscow\u2019s military interference in Ukraine, military support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and President Vladimir Putin\u2019s intolerance of political dissent. Republicans at the hearing said it was too soon to know whether a special counsel was appropriate in the case. Rosenstein noted that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch had been asked to appoint a special prosecutor when the allegations first came to light. He said she rejected the request and chose to use career prosecutors in the case. Rosenstein has experience working for a special counsel on investigations involving the presidency. In the mid-1990s he was part of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr\u2019s team of prosecutors who investigated Bill and Hillary Clinton. The 26-year Justice Department veteran is seen by many current and former department officials as a politically neutral pick. \u201cPolitical affiliations are irrelevant to my work,\u201d Rosenstein told the committee. Named as Maryland\u2019s top prosecutor by President George W. Bush, Rosenstein stayed in office through the Obama administration. \u201cMr. Rosenstein should commit to naming a special prosecutor to look into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia,\u201d said Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer in a statement.

        "text": "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis launched a global Roman Catholic campaign on Wednesday to improve the lot of immigrants and one of his top cardinals urged politicians to  touch the hand of a migrant  before trying to stereotype them. The two-year  Share the Journey  campaign comes at a time of growing anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States and many European countries where far-right parties have made inroads. On Sunday the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (Afd) party surged to third place in a national election, tapping into public disquiet over the arrival of more than a million migrants in Germany over the past two years. The pope, who has made defense of migrants a major plank of his pontificate, launched the campaign in comments to tens of thousands of people in St. Peter s Square for his weekly audience, urging Catholics around the world to be  open, inclusive and welcoming . Italy s anti-immigrant Northern League has vowed to clamp down on migration from developing countries if it takes power in a coalition government after next year s elections. At a news conference at the Vatican, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of Manila called for a  culture of personal encounter  where friendship supplants fear.  I would invite the leaders to meet a migrant, touch the hand of a migrant, smell a migrant, listen to their stories and you will see that they are like you and me,  he said.  They are not really  other . They could be me. They could be my brother, my sister, my parents,  said Tagle, whose grandfather left China for the Philippines as a poor boy. The two-year campaign of  action and awareness  is being spearheaded by Caritas Internationalis, the worldwide umbrella of Catholic charities. The campaign encourages local communities to facilitate encounters between migrants and those who fear or denigrate them  in church halls and private homes.  Look them in the eyes, listen to why they left their homes, how their journey s been, see the real people behind the numbers and scare stories,  Tagle said. He urged politicians  not to close the doors on people who might enrich your society . In the United States, where President Donald Trump wants to build a wall along the border with Mexico, his ex-chief strategist Steve Bannon - himself a Catholic - got embroiled in a row with the U.S. Catholic Church this month when he said its bishops backed illegal immigrants in order to fill empty pews. Francis this month said he hoped Trump would re-think his decision to end a program protecting undocumented immigrant children, saying it was important for young people to have roots. ",

        "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis flew into Seoul on Friday for annual defense talks as tensions with North Korea climb ahead of a visit to the region next month by President Donald Trump. Mattis has emphasized diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis during his week-long trip to Asia, even as North Korea\u2019s weapons tests and bellicose verbal exchanges between Pyongyang and Washington stoke fears of an armed confrontation. \u201cI carried the message that the more we do together today the greater the chance for enduring peace in the future,\u201d Mattis said earlier this week, looking back at three days of meetings with Asian defense chiefs in the Philippines.  \u201cThat\u2019s really what it was all about \u2013 to keep the (North Korea) effort firmly in the diplomatic lane for resolution.\u201d Even before landing in Seoul, Mattis held a meeting in the Philippines on Monday with his South Korea and Japanese counterparts, where they agreed to keep bolstering intelligence sharing about North Korea and enhance exercises.  \u201cNow we got to do the \u2018roll up our sleeves\u2019 (work) and do the pragmatic planning and coordination,\u201d he told reporters. Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera warned the threat from North Korea has grown to a \u201ccritical and imminent level\u201d. CIA chief Mike Pompeo said last week North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent.  U.S. intelligence experts say Pyongyang believes it needs the weapons to ensure its survival and have been skeptical about diplomatic efforts, focusing on sanctions, to get Pyongyang to denuclearize. The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on seven North Korean individuals and three entities for \u201cflagrant\u201d human rights abuses, including killings, torture, forced labor and the hunting down of asylum seekers abroad. Mattis is expected to meet South Korean leaders on Friday before he joins the top U.S. military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, at the annual \u201cSecurity Consultative Meeting\u201d with South Korea\u2019s military on Saturday. The visit comes just before Trump\u2019s departs on Nov. 3 to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, a trip which is expected to be dominated by the nuclear and ballistic missile threat posed by North Korea. Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to destroy North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies. Kim has blasted Trump as \u201cmentally deranged.\u201d Despite the rhetoric, White House officials say Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the standoff. But all options, including military ones, are on the table.  Mattis, for his part, dismissed the idea that U.S. allies were confused about the U.S. approach, noting U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s recent trip to Beijing to get China to do more to pressure Pyongyang.  China is North Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner.  \u201cDo we have military options in defense for attack, if our allies are attacked? Of course we do. But everyone is out for a peaceful resolution,\u201d Mattis told reporters traveling with him earlier this week. \u201cNo one\u2019s rushing for war.\u201d ",

        "title": "Yemen Islamist party members arrested, ratcheting up tensions",
        "text": "ADEN (Reuters) - Security forces in the southern Yemeni city of Aden arrested 10 members of an Islamist partner in the internationally-recognized government, the Islah party said on Wednesday. Aden is dominated by local forces backed by the United Arab Emirates, a key member of the Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen s civil war in 2015 to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power but is hostile toward Islamists. The arrests could raise tension within the coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi movement and forces loyal to ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh who seized much of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, and drove Hadi into exile. Islah said security forces raided the home of its number two man in Aden, Mohammed Abdel-Malek, and arrested him, along with a member of the party s local Shura Council as well as a local militia commander. Security forces also closed down the party s office in the al-Qaloua district of Aden, Islah said in a statement. A security source in Aden confirmed four people were arrested and said the move was related to the assassination of a Salafist imam in Aden on Tuesday by a bomb planted in his car. While both in the Islamist camp, Salafists and Islah are at odds as some of the former back a secession of south Yemen while the latter wants the Arabian Peninsula state to remain intact. It was unclear if the arrested Islah members had been formally charged.  (Islah) directs a call to public opinion, the government and the coalition demanding they shoulder their responsibility to swiftly release brother Abdel-Malek and his colleagues and to stop these arbitrary measures,  Islah s statement said. With thousands of fighters deployed on battlefronts against the Houthis, Islah has been an important ally of Hadi and the Saudi-led coalition trying to reinstate his government. But Islah, seen as linked with the Muslim Brotherhood, has come under pressure since a rift erupted between Qatar and some Arab states, including the UAE and Saudi Arabia, in June over allegations Qatar backs Islamist militants. Qatar denies this. Since the coalition intervened in Yemen, Islah has tried to distance itself from the Brotherhood in an effort to ease Gulf rulers  anxiety about its Islamist ideology.  The Brotherhood denies accusations from conservative Arab governments of involvement in terrorism, saying it seeks change only by peaceful means.   ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - President Donald Trump is considering adding a veteran Washington lawyer to the White House counsel\u2019s office to deal with Russia-related issues, people familiar with the matter said. Ty Cobb, a white-collar defense lawyer with the firm of Hogan Lovells and a former federal prosecutor, met with Trump about a week ago, another person said. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the administration had \u201cno announcement at this time.\u201d  Cobb did not respond to requests for comment except to say he was on vacation. Cobb, 66,\u00a0represented a number of individuals in government investigations during the Clinton administration, including former Democratic National Committee fundraiser John Huang and former White House aide David Watkins. Trump has been seeking a senior-level lawyer to join the office led by White House Counsel Don McGahn to focus on the various Russia investigations, one of the people said. In addition to a probe by special counsel Robert Mueller, several congressional panels are investigating Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential collusion by Trump\u2019s campaign. Moscow has denied any interference and Trump has denied any collusion. The role Cobb met with Trump about is separate from the legal team gathering to represent the president personally. That team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, now includes constitutional lawyer and evangelical radio talk show host Jay Sekulow, Washington lawyer John Dowd, and Michael Bowe, a partner at Kasowitz\u2019s firm. According to sources familiar with the matter, lawyers from major firms have turned down joining Trump\u2019s outside legal team, citing conflicts at their firms and concerns Trump would not listen to them.   Others lawyers have also turned down the role for which Cobb is being considered. William Burck, a partner at Quinn Emanuel, and Emmet Flood, a partner at Williams & Connolly, both turned down the opportunity, according to people familiar with the matter. Cobb, a distant relative of the famous baseball player of the same name, graduated from Harvard University and earned his law degree at Georgetown. In the 1980s, he was a federal prosecutor in Baltimore, where he led a regional drug and organized crime task force.  Cobb has some experience with leaks, which Trump has repeatedly complained about in relation to the Russia probes. In 2006, Cobb represented former CIA official Mary McCarthy, who was fired after she was accused of providing classified information to reporters. No charges were brought against McCarthy.

        "title": "Trump could find Democratic allies on tax reform: lawmaker",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the looming tax reform and infrastructure spending fight on Capitol Hill, President-elect Donald Trump may find unlikely  allies among Democrats, says the lawmaker soon to be the party\u2019s top tax-law writer in the U.S. House of Representatives. Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, who is in line to become the top Democrat on the House tax committee, said that in some crucial ways, Trump was more closely aligned to Democrats on tax issues than to his fellow Republicans. Citing the example of tax cuts for the middle class, Neal said Democrats were \u201cmore likely to be allies\u201d to Trump than Republicans in Congress. A House Republican \u201cblueprint\u201d for overhauling the tax code \u201cstill overwhelmingly favors people at the top. ... I am open to a middle-class tax cut that we should pay for,\u201d Neal said in a recent interview. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, said Trump\u2019s tax plan would give middle-class households an average tax cut of $1,010, or 1.8 percent of after-tax income. The center said Trump\u2019s plan would give much larger tax savings to high-income taxpayers. Trump\u2019s advisers have said that lower tax rates for the wealthy in the Trump plan are offset by loophole closures, resulting in no net tax cut for high earners. The center said that House Republicans\u2019 tax \u201cblueprint\u201d would give middle-class households an average $260 tax cut, much smaller than Trump\u2019s. It added that three-quarters of the blueprint\u2019s tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent. On infrastructure spending, another component of the emerging fiscal policy debate, Neal said he did not accept the $1 trillion price tag on Trump\u2019s plan or its emphasis on revenue-producing projects. He said, however, that he saw infrastructure spending as an important job creator for blue-collar constituents that Democrats should back.   \u201cWe traditionally have been the party of infrastructure investment and it tends to be investment that puts our people to work,\u201d said Neal. \u201cWe need to do something that\u2019s conducive to more investment and more job creation.\u201d The Trump team and Republicans in Congress are trying to hammer out an agreement on tax reform by early 2017. Trump advisers have called for bipartisan legislation. Representative Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of Neal\u2019s tax committee, said on Wednesday he had invited Democrats to offer their best ideas on tax reform. With Trump due to be inaugurated on Jan. 20 and Republicans in control of the House and Senate, hopes are running high for the biggest tax overhaul in 30 years. Businesses are eager to see a cut in the 35 percent corporate income tax rate. Trump wants it down to 15 percent, while House Republicans want it cut to 20 percent. Neal has been in Congress since 1989 and is known in the business community as a moderate. He is replacing Michigan Democrat Sander Levin as the committee\u2019s ranking member.  He said the odds of a tax reform deal were \u201cat best 50-50\u201d given the range of political and economic interests involved. It would be hard to cut the corporate rate below 28 percent, he said, without endangering tax breaks popular with the middle class, including deductions for home mortgages and charitable donations and the employer-sponsored health insurance deduction. Lower rates and infrastructure spending should be paid for with revenues raised from repatriation of $2.6 trillion in U.S. corporate profits now stashed overseas, Neal said. The repatriated profits should go to capital investments and infrastructure, not stock buybacks or dividends, as happened after a Bush-era tax holiday more than a decade ago. \u201cIt strikes me that there is some room to talk about how that money might be invested in America, and then we can argue about the rate once we\u2019ve decided the parameters of what we think it might be moved for,\u201d he said.

        "title": "'No more woe is me': Senator McCain vows quick return to Washington",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/PHOENIX, Ariz. (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain promised on Thursday he would return rapidly to Washington despite his newly diagnosed brain cancer, flashing the fighting spirit that has defined him since he was held in captivity as a Navy pilot during the Vietnam War. McCain, a veteran senator and former Republican presidential candidate known as a strong and sometimes fiercely independent voice on defense and security issues, was found to have an aggressive form of brain tumor, glioblastoma, after surgery last week for a blood clot above his left eye. The news, issued by his office late on Wednesday, drew a wave of support from across the political spectrum, and raised questions about how long McCain would be absent from the Senate, where Republicans have a narrow majority and are eager to notch up some legislative successes for President Donald Trump. \u201cI greatly appreciate the outpouring of support - unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, I\u2019ll be back soon, so stand-by!\u201d McCain, 80, wrote on Twitter shortly before issuing a news release through his office related to Syria. McCain was making phone calls from his home in Phoenix, Arizona, to stay abreast of congressional matters. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one McCain\u2019s closest friends in Congress, said the senator called him three times on Thursday morning. He wanted to discuss healthcare legislation that is at the center of the Senate\u2019s attention, and a sprawling defense bill McCain would usher through as the Senate Armed Services Committee\u2019s chairman, Graham said. Graham told reporters McCain admonished him, \u201c\u2018No more woe is me.\u2019 He is yelling at me to buck up. I\u2019m going to buck up.\u201d  The son and grandson of admirals, McCain survived more than five years of captivity during the Vietnam War. As a lawmaker  he has been a strong advocate for the U.S. military as well as being willing to cross the political aisle and work with Democrats. Among Republican lawmakers, he has been one of the most critical of Trump. Well-wishers included Democratic former President Barack Obama and Trump, who called McCain on Thursday to wish him well, the White House said.  Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said the flood of \u201cbipartisan respect and love for John McCain as he faces this cancer battle reminds us that, after all the meanness, there is a human side to politicians. Count this Democrat in John McCain\u2019s corner.\u201d Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and most deadly form of brain and nervous system tumor, typically killing half its victims within a year. Patients rarely survive more than three years. Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy died of the disease in 2009. McCain\u2019s doctors said he was recovering from surgery well, and praised his underlying health as excellent. His doctors told CNN on Wednesday that he had no sign of neurological impairment before or during his surgery. Treatment options include a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. McCain\u2019s illness has potential policy implications for healthcare legislation and other agenda items in Washington.    Republicans hold a narrow 52-48 seat majority in the Senate, and McCain\u2019s absence has made it more difficult to gather the 50 votes needed to advance a healthcare bill. He has been recovering at his Arizona home since his initial surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix last week. It was not immediately clear when he would return to Washington. McCain has previously battled back from injuries suffered during his time as a prisoner of war, and has had non-invasive melanomas removed at least three times. McCain, who ran a failed White House race in 2008 against Obama, won a sixth six-year term in the U.S. Senate last November.  If the senator were to retire or die before his term ends in January 2023, the state\u2019s Republican governor would pick a Republican replacement, who would serve until a special election in November 2018. Whoever was elected would fill out McCain\u2019s term. Arizona\u2019s other senator, Republican Jeff Flake, is up for re-election next year. The state\u2019s electorate is divided: one-third Republican voters, nearly one-third Democratic and one-third independent. Matt Roberts, spokesman for the Arizona Secretary of State\u2019s office, said registered independents would soon exceed Republicans. But Republicans tend to turn out to vote on Election Day in stronger numbers than their counterparts. The Southwestern state is the birthplace of former Senator and 1964 presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, who some call the father of the Republican conservative movement. ",

        "text": "TALLINN (Reuters) - The European Union should add more sanctions on North Korea as part of international pressure following Pyongyang s largest nuclear test to date, the bloc s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Thursday. While sanctions have so far done little to stop North Korea boosting its nuclear and missile capacity, Federica Mogherini said more such steps were required along with piling on political pressure.  I would propose to ministers today to strengthen the economic pressure on North Korea, supporting a new U.N. Security Council resolution adopting tougher economic measures, starting new autonomous EU sanctions... and working with other partners in the world to make sure that everybody implements fully and strictly the already-decided economic measures,  Mogherini told reporters before meeting the EU defense and foreign ministers in the Estonian capital. The United States and China are discussing options to rein in Pyongyang and South Korea has deployed a defense system aimed at countering North Korean missile attacks. No formal EU decision is expected from the bloc on Thursday and its leverage on Pyongyang, as well as Russia and China   North Korea s main ally   is limited.   It has to be pursued because the alternative in our view is and could be extremely dangerous, especially if in front of you have an interlocutor that might act quite irrationally.  ",

        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Thursday an Obama-era experimental defense outpost in Silicon Valley would grow in importance under the Trump administration and that the nation\u2019s technology entrepreneurs were vital to national defense. Mattis paid his first official visit to the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Innovation Experimental Unit, or DIUx, in Mountain View, California, as part of a two-day outreach tour to the U.S. technology industry intended to highlight the Pentagon\u2019s commitment to technology innovation. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that DIUx will not only continue to exist, it will actually grow in its influence and its impact on the Department of Defense,\u201d Mattis told reporters during brief remarks at the DIUx facility. DIUx was set up two years ago by Mattis\u2019 predecessor, Ash Carter. It serves as a Pentagon hub for attracting private-sector innovation to solve complex and technical military challenges. But DIUx has faced criticism from some Republican lawmakers who have questioned its value and organization. The program underwent an overhaul in May 2016, less than a year after launching. Since June of last year DIUx has awarded $100 million in contracts for 45 pilot projects in areas including artificial intelligence, autonomous machines and space. The unit currently has 48 staff and is expected to grow to about 75 by the end of 2018, said Sean Singleton, DIUx\u2019s director of engagement. Mattis said DIUx would help the U.S. military become \u201cmore lethal and more capable of defending our experiment that is called the United States of America.\u201d The unit\u2019s leadership was reporting directly to his senior staff, Mattis said, adding that he expected DIUx would help the military incorporate advances in artificial intelligence taking place in Silicon Valley. The defense secretary\u2019s visit came as the Trump administration has sparred with the technology industry on a host of issues, including immigration, climate change and privacy. Earlier on Thursday Mattis visited Amazon\u2019s headquarters in Seattle. He was expected to visit Alphabet\u2019s Google headquarters in Palo Alto, California, on Friday. \u201cA pleasure to host #SecDef James Mattis at Amazon HQ in Seattle today,\u201d Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos wrote on Twitter in a post that included a photo of him and Mattis smiling at one another.

        "title": "Kenyan opposition chief to focus on corruption in election re-run",
        "text": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga says he will make the mismanagement of last month s annulled presidential vote the focus of his new election campaign, linking it to a series of political scandals.  The Supreme Court last week nullified the Aug. 8 election, ruling that incumbent president Uhuru Kenyatta s win by 1.4 million votes was invalid due to flaws in the tallying process.   Right now, we are basically dealing with the rigging of elections, which is basically an extension of corruption,  Odinga told Reuters in an interview on Thursday, repeating his allegation, rejected by the court, that Kenyatta had deliberately manipulated the vote.  Odinga has threatened to boycott the re-run unless a series of demands are met.  The court ruling sent shockwaves through Kenya, East Africa s richest country per capita and a relatively stable ally of the West in a region beset by conflict.  Although it caused political uncertainty, many hope it will eventually reduce the chance of political violence by rebuilding trust in Kenya s battered public institutions.  The election commission set the re-run for Oct. 17, but Odinga reiterated his stance that he would not take part unless some electoral officials were fired and the opposition were given access to voting data that they say will prove their allegation of deliberate rigging. The board has said different staff will be in charge of the re-run, but has not opened up the election records for scrutiny or announced any disciplinary measures.   This election shows that Jubilee (the ruling party) have taken corruption to the stratosphere in our country ... it is very regrettable, it is actually shameful that a government can preside over this fraud.  The judges said Kenyatta was not at fault and the blame lay with the election commission, which had not followed procedures designed to allow a transparent vote. A more detailed ruling is expected this month. Jubilee has also denied manipulating the vote. But Odinga s words may resonate with Kenyans tired of the corruption scandals that have dominated front pages in recent years, including allegations that tens of millions of dollars went missing from the Health Ministry and National Youth Service.  The auditor-general regularly issues scathing reports about missing funds, but action is rarely taken. No top official has been successfully prosecuted.  Odinga, who presents himself as a champion of the poor, built his previous campaign on criticism of high inflation and shortages of the staple maize flour after a regional drought.  He has criticized government borrowing, and promised to lower the deficit by improving revenue collection and slashing graft. He said he would preserve the large infrastructure projects that were the centerpiece of Kenyatta s re-election campaign.  Odinga also plans to substantially reshape Kenya s policy towards its neighbors if he wins, setting a timeline to withdraw Kenyan troops from Somalia and calling for the release of South Sudanese rebel leader Riek Machar, currently under house arrest in South Africa, to participate in peace talks.

        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration should consider supporting a Beijing-backed free trade deal in the Asia-Pacific, state media said on Tuesday, adding that China would be relieved to see a rival U.S.-led trade deal wither under Trump. During his election campaign, Trump took a protectionist stance on trade issues and labeled the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) championed by President Barack Obama a \u201cdisaster\u201d.  There is now little chance of it coming up for vote in Washington before his inauguration in January. Obama had framed the TPP, which excludes China, as part of his \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d and as an effort to write Asia\u2019s trade rules before Beijing could. China had feared the United States would use the TPP to either force it to open markets by signing up or else to isolate it from other regional economies. \u201cOf course, Beijing is understandably relieved that the exclusive, economically inefficient, politically antagonizing TPP is looking ever less likely to materialize by the day,\u201d the official English-language China Daily newspaper said in an editorial. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade talks, which are supported by Beijing but to which the United States is not party, are viewed by some observers as a competitor to U.S. economic leadership in the region. \u201cThe incoming administration should realize that the more open, inclusive Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will turn out to be a far more efficient vehicle for advancing U.S. interests,\u201d the China Daily said. \u201cWashington may want to take advantage of the nascent, evolving platform and become involved from the rule-making stage. U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific will not abate if the Trump administration chooses to engage with the region constructively,\u201d the paper said. Such editorials in state-run media do not represent Chinese government policy but they are indicative of official thinking.  RCEP groups the 10 members of the Association of South East Asian Nations plus China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand, but currently does not offer the same high level of free trade openings as the TPP. China has said it will seek support for another nascent Beijing-led trade framework, the Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP), at a regional summit this month. Peru, which will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting and is party to the TPP, has said that Pacific-rim countries can forge a new trade deal to replace the TPP that includes China and Russia but not the United States.

        "text": "(Reuters) - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday the attack in Brussels that killed more than 30 people is the \u201clatest brutal reminder\u201d that more must be done to defeat Islamic State militants, including by European Union member countries. In an address at Stanford University in California, Clinton said the United States and Europe should take a \u201charder look\u201d at protocols at airports and other \u201csoft sites\u201d that are outside security perimeters.  Clinton also said \u201cthere is much we can do to support our European partners\u201d but \u201cthere is also more they can do to share the burden with us.\u201d Clinton said she would like to see more European countries investing in defense and security in the way Germany has during the Obama administration. \u201cThe most urgent task is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East\u201d who are citizens of France, Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom with European passports that make it easier for them to cross into Syria and return radicalized, Clinton said. Clinton said that many European nations do not currently alert their neighbors when they turn away a \u201csuspected jihadist\u201d at their border or when a citizen\u2019s passport is stolen. European Union countries also need to share traveler information more readily, Clinton said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from EU nations than it is for EU nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement that the United States negotiated when I was secretary of state,\u201d Clinton said. Additional steps that could be taken in Europe are the creation of a \u201cnew, unified, European border and coast guard\u201d to strengthen the external borders of a continent that is under \u201cunprecedented pressure from refugees and migrants,\u201d Clinton said. Clinton also praised past partnerships between the United States and Europe, calling the NATO alliance between North American and European countries one of the best investments that America has made. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has in recent days said that the United States should rethink its involvement in the decades-old alliance. Clinton also took aim at Trump, along with presidential rival U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, when she slammed \u201coffensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims,\u201d including those who could be partners in the fight against terrorism.

        "title": "Kurdish city gassed by Saddam hopes referendum heralds better days",
        "text": "HALABJA, Iraq (Reuters) - When poison gas killed thousands of Kurds in Halabja in 1988, its residents never imagined they would ever escape Saddam Hussein s grip, let alone vote one day in a referendum on secession from Iraq. The long-oppressed Kurds across northern Iraq are expected to get the chance to vote on Monday despite fierce opposition from the Baghdad government and regional powers who feel threatened by the referendum. It will be a bittersweet moment for the people of Halabja, a rundown city of around 75,000 people still facing the after-effects of the attack by Iraqi government forces. At a memorial to honor the victims is a statue of Omar Khawar, whose image holding his two dead twin babies which appeared in photographs around the world has come to symbolize the tragedy in Halabja. Halabja residents interviewed by Reuters said they would vote  Yes . But they were only cautiously optimistic. They wonder whether feuding Kurdish political parties can deliver on promises of a viable independent state when basic needs such as specialized medical care, jobs and infrastructure have not been met.  He would rest peacefully knowing that we will vote Yes,  said Khawar s nephew Borhan Gharib.  We think freedom is better than anything. There is no country that gets independence without a price.  The referendum will be the culmination of a century-long struggle for self-determination for the Kurds. When the Middle was carved up by the West in a deal in 1916 after the fall of the Ottoman empire, the Kurds were the largest ethnic group without a state. The region s roughly 30 million ethnic Kurds were left scattered across four countries   Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria.   Though they were widely mistreated, the Kurds suffered a particularly brutal fate in Iraq, where Saddam Hussein gassed them, buried them in mass graves and gave their land to Arabs. Halabja marked the peak of his campaign against the Kurds. Saddam accused the Halabja Kurds of siding with Iran during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. The gas attack was a turning point, winning the Iraqi Kurds worldwide sympathy. Five thousand people, mostly women and children, were killed and thousands more wounded starting at 1153 a.m. on March 16, 1988 and more are still suffering from cancer and other diseases related to poison gas.   Yet, near the memorial is a hospital built for victims of the tragedy   construction has been completed but the facility was never opened.  I am very, very angry,  said Lukman Abdel Qadir Mohammed, whose organization represents the families of the victims.   We still send more than 1,000 people every month to Iran for treatment.  Mohammed was speaking to Reuters in the house of Omar Khawar, donated by Borhan to the Halabja Chemical Attack Victims  Society.  On the pavement outside is the spot where Khawar died, face down on the ground, trying to protect his sons. Gas crept into homes and along streets. His wife and eight daughters perished. Years later, the Kurds enjoyed unprecedented protection when Western powers set up a no-fly zone to protect them from Saddam Hussein s air force in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War. The U.S.-led invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003  enabled the Kurds to eventually set up a semi-autonomous region.  But neighboring countries worried that Iraqi Kurdish ambitions would embolden their own restive Kurdish populations to agitate for change. Despite those concerns, stronger than ever because of the referendum, jubilant Kurds waved flags in the streets in the run-up to the vote.   Halabja seemed less enthusiastic, unlike other cities where banners drawing attention to the referendum hang on buildings. Kurdish President Masoud Barzani has resisted pressure from Turkey and Iran, as well as Western powers, to postpone the vote for fears it could trigger regional chaos. Kashwar Mawloud spends works as a tour guide at the museum. Like others, she says she suffers from cancer from the attack and has to travel to a major city to get treatment every month. She never wants anyone to forget about the massacre. First she walks visitors through a room illustrating Halabja s rich political history and culture.  Then there are re-creations of iconic images of the day of the attack and reminders of who orchestrated the suffering.  They include the rope that museum officials say was used to hang Saddam s cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid, who earned the nickname  chemical Ali  for directing a series of chemical attacks on Kurds, including Halabja.   Nearby is the death certificate issued after Saddam Hussein was executed following his trial. But when it comes to the future, Halabja Kurds wonder whether anything will change.  No one has invested anything in Halabja except for this museum,  said Mawloud. The region has long been plagued by political disunity between Barzani s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and decades-old rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), headed by Jalal Talabani. It was most recently exacerbated by the extension of Barzani s term.  The KDP controls the western part of the region while the PUK runs the east, where Halabja is located. The two fought a civil war during the 1990s. Kurdish officials were not immediately available for comment on allegations that Halabja has been neglected. Galawish Kareem, 70, lives across the street from Omar Khawar s former home. She has not relied on any Kurdish political leaders for help since the attack destroyed her neighborhood and killed 70 relatives, including her son.  Barzani, Talabani have done nothing for us,  she said.  We rebuilt our houses ourselves.  She laughed when asked if the central government in Baghdad had helped. For some, like Gibrael Omar, Halabja s dark past, not the path to independence, is still the overriding issue.  Omar and his mother take turns visiting the mass grave where 33 members of their family were buried in the days following the attack.  I will vote for neither Yes or No,  he said at a cemetery. Some residents worry that the vote will only bring more bloodshed to the region, with fierce opposition from Turkey and Iran. The Baghdad government has called the vote unconstitutional.  Tensions are running high between Iranian-backed Shi ite militias and Kurdish fighters   who cooperated in the fight against Islamic State   over the prospect of an independent Kurdistan. Despite the uncertainty, Mohammed, the head of the victims  organization, says sacrifices must be made for the sake of liberty. He lost his siblings, mother and  wife and is still suffering from medical issues.  Conflict (between Kurds and Shi ite militias) will happen maybe not today or tomorrow. But it has to,  he said.  But ultimately we will be fine.  One hundred fighters from Halabja died fighting Daesh (Islamic State). We can send one hundred more to fight the militias.   ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman intends to sue the federal government if Republican lawmakers pass proposed legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system, his office said on Monday. Schneiderman\u2019s office said it has identified \u201cmultiple constitutional defects\u201d with the Republican healthcare bills. The U.S. Senate is considering legislation to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, commonly known as Obamacare. However, eight to 10 Republican U.S. senators have serious concerns about the proposals, moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins, who opposes the bill, said on Sunday. Democratic state attorneys general have become a major source of opposition to Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s policies, having successfully forced him to significantly scale back a ban on travel from six Muslim-majority countries. A group of Democrats led by Schneiderman and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra earlier this year sought to intervene in a pending lawsuit in order to defend subsidies paid to health insurers under Obamacare. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has not yet ruled on that request.  Among the Republican proposals that raise constitutional issues are one that would defund the Planned Parenthood health group for a year, and another that would shift some Medicaid costs in New York from counties to the state, known as the Collins-Faso amendment, said Amy Spitalnick, a Schneiderman spokeswoman. Critics of the latter provision say it would drastically increase costs in the state budget for the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and disabled. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit threat. A representative for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell could not immediately be reached for comment. ",

        "title": "Mattis plays down split between Trump, Tillerson on North Korea",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Tuesday played down an apparent split between the U.S. president and his top diplomat over outreach to North Korea, saying America\u2019s focus was still on finding a diplomatic solution to the dispute with Pyongyang. President Donald Trump, who has traded insults and threats with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in recent weeks, said on Sunday Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was \u201cwasting his time\u201d trying to negotiate with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program. Tillerson, during a trip to China on Saturday, said the United States had direct channels of communication with the North and was probing Pyongyang to see if it was interested in dialogue. He expressed hope for reducing tensions with North Korea, which is fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. \u201cI do not see the divergence as strongly as some ... have interpreted it,\u201d Mattis said. Both Mattis and Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, broadly backed Tillerson\u2019s efforts as they testified at the hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s guidance to both Secretary Tillerson and me has been very clearly that we would ... pursue the diplomatic effort to include with the various initiatives with China,\u201d Mattis told a Senate hearing. \u201cI believe that Secretary Tillerson is accurately stating that we are probing for opportunities to talk with the North. All we\u2019re doing is probing. We\u2019re not talking with them, consistent with the president\u2019s dismay about not talking with them before the time is right.\u201d Trump has vowed to halt North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions and tensions have escalated in recent months, with Pyongyang conducting its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3. It has also threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific. Dunford, the top U.S. military officer, strongly backed Tillerson\u2019s efforts to tighten an economic squeeze on North Korea. The international community\u2019s sanctions will need to be strong enough to convince Kim he cannot survive in power unless he changes course, he said. Dunford said Kim sees possession of ballistic missiles and a nuclear capability as inextricably linked to regime survival, adding: \u201cWhat I think Kim Jong Un needs to realize is that he cannot survive with ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons because the international community will not allow him to survive.\u201d Dunford said Kim was particularly sensitive to the flow of oil into North Korea, saying when there has been a cut-off in the past \u201cthere\u2019s been a change in Kim Jong Un\u2019s behavior.\u201d \u201cThe fact is he needs economic resources external to the country to survive,\u201d he said. U.S. Senator Jack Reed questioned whether some degree of communication was vital between Washington and Pyongyang, given the risks of miscalculation by either side that could lead to conflict. Mattis suggested that the Trump administration was exploring a host of ways to influence the North, including through diplomacy. \u201cI think the president dispatching Secretary Tillerson to Beijing here within the past several days to carry messages and to look at the way we can work with them is the most accurate answer to your question, that in fact this is part of a whole ... integrated effort that we have underway right now,\u201d Mattis said. It was not the first time the White House and State Department have seemed at odds on policy issues, but the White House has said Trump still had confidence in Tillerson. Trump has vowed to halt North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions and tensions have escalated in recent months, with Pyongyang conducting its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3. It has also threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific. The fate of Americans held in North Korea is also a bone of contention. The Trump administration has demanded North Korea release three U.S. citizens it has detained: missionary Kim Dong Chul and academics Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song. The Trump White House and State Department have taken divergent stances on other foreign policy issues. When a dispute over Qatar erupted this year, Trump strongly backed Gulf Arab leaders who accuse Qatar of supporting Iran as well as Islamist militants.  Trump accused Qatar of being a \u201chigh-level\u201d funder of terrorism even as the Pentagon and Tillerson cautioned against the military, commercial and humanitarian effects of a boycott imposed by Arab states. Months into the dispute, Trump adopted a position more in line with that of the State Department. ",

        "text": "PRAGUE (Reuters) - The websites used for presentation of the Czech Republic s election results were hacked on Saturday afternoon, the Czech Statistical Office (CSU) said on Sunday, adding that the vote count was not affected. Czechs voted on Friday and Saturday in the parliamentary election, with the results then shown on two websites that CSU maintains with an outside provider.  During the processing (of the vote), there was a targeted DDoS attack aimed at the infrastructure of the O2 company used for elections,  CSU said on its website.      As a result, servers volby.cz and volbyhned.cz had been temporarily partly inaccessible. The attack did not in any way affect either the infrastructure used for the transmission of election results to the CSU headquarters or the independent data processing.  The anti-establishment ANO party won 29.6 percent of the vote but may struggle to find coalition partners. Many parties expressed reluctance or rejected outright any coalition with the ANO while its billionaire founder and leader Andrej Babis fights off fraud charges. Czech President Milos Zeman said on Sunday that he would name Andrej Babis prime minister.  In the last similar case, in January, the Czech Foreign Ministry said that hackers had breached dozens of its email accounts in an attack resembling one against the U.S. Democratic Party that the former Obama administration blamed on Russia. On the European Union level, the threat of cyber attacks has been taken more seriously in recent months after hacking attempts detected by some of the 28 member states. EU defense ministers tested their ability to respond to a potential hacking attack in their first cyber war games in September. The exercise was based on a simulated attack on one of the bloc s military missions abroad. ",

        "title": "Reporter files criminal charge of battery against Trump campaign chief",
        "text": "(Reuters) - A reporter for the conservative website Breitbart News filed a criminal complaint on Friday against Republican presidential election front-runner Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, saying he grabbed her arm at a rally with such force that he left bruises. A police report released on Friday showed that the reporter, Michelle Fields, said she was the victim of battery on Tuesday night at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, where Trump spoke after that day\u2019s contests in the race to nominate the party\u2019s candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election. The accusation prompted a flurry of exchanges between Trump\u2019s campaign and Fields. The campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and Trump have denied the accusation. Lewandowski dismissed Fields as an \u201cattention seeker\u201d on Twitter. Fields published her account at Breitbart on Thursday of what happened when reporters gathered around Trump to ask him additional questions after a press conference. Fields said she asked Trump about his views on affirmative action. \u201cTrump acknowledged the question, but before he could answer I was jolted backwards. Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken,\u201d Fields wrote. A Trump campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, questioned Fields\u2019 story on Friday. Hicks said she had not seen any encounter and said no cameras had captured the incident. Fields, who posted a photo on Twitter of bruises on her arm,  initially said she did not know who had grabbed her and caused her to stumble. Ben Terris, a Washington Post reporter who witnessed the incident, told her Lewandowski had seized her arm. He wrote his own account for his newspaper. The political news site Politico posted a transcript of an audio recording of the incident, which included an exchange between Terris and Fields. \u201cYeah he just threw you down,\u201d Terris said to Fields, who replied, \u201cI can\u2019t believe he just did that. That was so hard. Was that Corey?\u201d Terris said that it was and later reported that Fields was tearful after the incident. In a statement on Friday, Breitbart Chief Executive Officer Larry Solov said Trump\u2019s suggestion that Fields may have invented the episode was contradicted by the evidence. \u201cBreitbart News stands behind Michelle Fields,\u201d he wrote. Hours later, however, the website posted a story disputing Terris\u2019 account. The story said that footage from the event showed Trump flanked by two men: Lewandowski and a security official who bore some resemblance to the campaign manager. \u201cThe person who made contact with Fields was likely not Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski,\u201d the report said. Terris stood by his account on Friday. He was quoted in a blog by Washington Post reporter Erik Wemple as saying, \u201cI saw what I saw.\u201d Terris did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. Fields and Solov could not immediately be reached for comment on the complaint to police. Trump\u2019s rallies across the United States have been marked by rowdiness and physical contact between protesters and either his supporters or security personnel. At a rally in Virginia on Feb. 29, a Time magazine photographer trying to document the exit of dozens of black protesters was grabbed by the neck and shoved to the ground by a U.S. Secret Service agent. White House spokesman Josh Earnest also weighed in on the Fields incident on Friday, telling reporters: \u201cThere is no excuse or justification for acts of violence against reporters who are covering a political event.\u201d  (Reporting by Joseph Ax; Additional reporting by Colleen Jenkins and Jeff Mason; editing by Grant McCool) This article was funded in part by SAP.

        "title": "Wall Street raises targets on Netflix, citing price increases",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) shares hit an all-time high on Friday as Goldman Sachs and other brokerages raised their price targets on the world s biggest online-streaming company, citing its ability to raise fees without scaring away customers.  The home of  House of Cards  and  Narcos  has been spending heavily on new shows and acquiring the rights to other TV series as it looks to lure more people away from traditional cable TV. To help fund that spending - a sticking point with the company s critics - Netflix said it would raise prices for two of its three main subscription plans.  Content remains the primary driver of subscriber growth and engagement (and the pricing power that comes with it),  Goldman analyst Heath Terry wrote in a note. Netflix is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Monday, although that quarter will not reflect the recent price increases, which take effect in November.  Goldman expects the company to report that it added a net 1.1 million U.S. and 4.3 million international subscribers in the third quarter, partly driven by new shows such as  Ozark.   The number of subscribers is Wall Street s most closely watched gauge of the company s growth. Goldman s estimate is above most other analysts, who are on average expecting 810,000 U.S. and 3.69 million international subscriber additions, according to FactSet.  we believe upward revisions to consensus estimates will ultimately drive further outperformance,  Terry said. Goldman, which has a  buy  rating on the stock, boosted its price target to $235 from $200. The median price target on Netflix s stock is $208, which has moved up 22 percent over roughly three months, showing Wall Street s growing bullishness. Netflix shares rose to an all-time high of $200.82 on Friday. They have jumped 58 percent so far this year. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth lowered his estimate for net subscriber additions for the fourth quarter by 255,000 to 6.7 million due to a modest uptick in churn, but said the fee increase was clearly a positive for Netflix. Anmuth raised his Netflix price target on Friday to $225 from $210. Not everybody is on board with Netflix s aggressive spending, however.  The thing that has kept us on the sidelines is ... this company is continuing to burn cash,  said Michael Scanlon, a portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management, adding that Netflix was up against many deep-pocketed competitors.  Netflix expects to spend $6 billion this year and $7 billion in 2018 to produce original shows and movies to stay ahead of Amazon.com s (AMZN.O) Prime Video service and Hulu. Earlier this week, Hulu bid out others for U.S. rights to  This is Us.  The company expects to spend about $2.5 billion in 2017 on buying movies and TV show rights. Also, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) said in August it will stop providing new movies to Netflix from 2019 and launch its own streaming service. Hulu dropped the price of its cheapest plan package by $2 for the first year of subscription, days after Netflix raised prices. The company last disclosed the size of its subscriber base in May 2016 as 12 million paying customers, according to Variety. Netflix had nearly 104 million members as of June 30. Analysts expect Netflix to report a third-quarter adjusted profit of 32 cents per share, and revenue up 30 percent to $2.97 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   ",

        "title": "Thailand plans joint arms factory with China",
        "text": "BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand s defense technology agency plans to set up a joint center with China to produce and maintain military equipment in the latest sign of the strengthening security relationship since a 2014 coup. The plans to establish the facility - and discussions on a Chinese naval center to serve submarines Thailand ordered this year - point to a growing Chinese security presence in the oldest U.S. ally in the region as elsewhere in Southeast Asia. The Thai government s Defence Technology Institute (DTI) will set up Thailand s first commercial joint defense facility with China in the northeastern province of Khon Kaen in July, a defense ministry spokesman said. It will be responsible for assembly, production and maintenance of Chinese land weapon systems for the Thai army.  All our production will be for domestic official usage,  defense ministry spokesman Kongcheep Tantravanich told Reuters, adding that it could become an assembly and maintenance center for all states in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Specific details, he said, were subject to further discussions between the ministry and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) - which makes tanks and weapons among other heavy equipment. NORINCO did not respond immediately to an emailed request for comment. Its website describes it as  a pioneer and leader of Chinese military trade, and an important team to implement China s Going Global strategy . Kongcheep said the Chinese would provide training and technology transfer, but details of any Chinese personnel in Khon Kaen were among things being discussed. The Chinese Defense Ministry did not respond when contacted by Reuters for comment. China has become an increasingly important source of weapons for Thailand, particularly since the United States and Western countries downgraded ties after the army seized power in 2014. Major purchases since 2015 include orders for 49 Chinese tanks and 34 armored vehicles worth over $320 million - much more than the army has bought from other countries, although it also ordered helicopters from both Russia and the United States. The biggest Chinese purchase is the Royal Thai Navy s order for three submarines at a cost of over $1 billion. Thai and Chinese armies and air forces have begun joint exercises, complementing Thailand s continuing drills with the U.S. forces. On the civilian front, Thailand and China plan development of a high-speed rail link as part of Beijing s Belt and Road initiative. Relations with the United States are warming again too, however, particularly since new U.S. President Donald Trump hosted junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha at the White House. The joint weapons manufacturing center in Khon Kaen - apparently similar to one in Pakistan - could complement China s growing military presence in neighboring Cambodia, said Paul Chambers, who has researched Thai military and regional security.  It opens the door for the potential of growing Chinese military influence in mainland Southeast Asia,  said Chambers, of Naresuan University in the northern Thai province of Phitsanulok. New legislation taking effect next year will allow Thailand s Defence Technology Institute to operate on a commercial basis, but it will remain entirely under government ownership. Thailand s Defence Ministry said the government was also holding preliminary discussions with Ukraine, Russia and South Africa about joint defense manufacturing facilities, similar to the deal with China.

Trump has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping while also demanding that Beijing increase pressure on North Korea over its nuclear program and to change trade practices to make them more favorable to the United States. The  national security strategy, to be rolled out in a speech by Trump, should not be seen as an attempt to contain China but rather to offer a clear-eyed look at the challenges China poses, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The strategy, which was still being drafted, may also reverse Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s declaration in September 2016 that climate change is a threat to security, one official said. Trump, a Republican, is to lay out his foreign policy priorities, and will emphasize his commitment to \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies such as building up the U.S. military, confronting Islamist militants and realigning trade relationships to make the United States more competitive, the officials said.

        "text": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hundreds of people marched through Los Angeles on Sunday in a May Day rally that took aim at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump for his anti-illegal immigration platform that includes building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. The demonstration in America\u2019s second most populous city, which has a large immigrant population, came just days after protesters smashed the window of a police car and blocked traffic outside a Trump campaign event in Costa Mesa, California, 40 miles (64 km) southeast of Los Angeles. On Friday, demonstrators blocked the entrance of a hotel hosting the California Republican convention in Burlingame, south of San Francisco, forcing Trump to halt his motorcade and go through a back entrance to deliver his speech. The rally in Los Angeles remained peaceful and drew smaller crowds than some past May Day demonstrations in the city, with several hundred people marching through downtown at one point but largely dispersing by midafternoon.  Members of the crowd carried a large blow-up effigy of Trump holding a Ku Klux Klan hood, along with signs that read: \u201cDump Trump.\u201d  \u201cHe\u2019s threatened that should he become president of the United States, in his first 18 months in office, he fully intends to deport all 11 million-plus undocumented persons in the United States. We don\u2019t take that lightly,\u201d said Juan Jose Gutierrez, of the Full Rights for Immigrants Coalition. Others waved Mexican or U.S. flags or signs that called for immigration reform and an end to deportations. A Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman said no arrests were made and there were no reports of violence.  Protests have become common outside rallies for Trump, 69, the New York billionaire businessman. He has aroused criticism for his pledge to deport illegal immigrants, even as it helped propel him in the race for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. He has accused Mexico of sending drug dealers and rapists to the United States and has promised to build a wall along the southern border and make Mexico pay for it. Trump said on Sunday he will have essentially sealed the Republican nomination if he wins Tuesday\u2019s contest in Indiana, where he holds a big lead over chief rival Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas. California holds its presidential primary on June 7.  ",

        "title": "Police charge Czech PM candidate Babis with subsidy fraud",
        "text": "PRAGUE (Reuters) - Andrej Babis, the frontrunner to become Czech prime minister after this month s election, said on Monday he had been formally charged with fraud in a case involving a 2 million euro EU subsidy a decade ago. Babis has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, saying the investigation was a plot by adversaries who want to prevent him from taking power and cutting corruption links between the EU member country s incumbent politicians and business.   I have received a decision on the commencement of criminal prosecution in the pseudo-case ... I immediately appealed this decision,  Babis said in a text message through his spokeswoman. Spokesmen for the Prague prosecutor and police were not immediately available for comment. The charges were expected after police asked parliament in August to lift parliamentary immunity of the billionaire businessman Babis, leader of the ANO movement, and ANO deputy chief Jaroslav Faltynek. Parliament voted to allow prosecution on Sept 6. The ANO spokeswoman said Faltynek, former executive at companies owned by Babis, had also been charged with fraud. He also denies wrongdoing. Babis is almost certain to win a new parliamentary mandate in the Oct 20-21 vote, which would renew his immunity. Parliament would have to vote again to lift it to allow the prosecution to go ahead.  ANO is expected to win the most votes in the election but fall short of an overall majority in parliament. Several potential coalition parties have said they would not join a government led by Babis personally due to the investigation.  The case involves an allegation that Babis hid ownership a decade ago of the farm and conference center, Capi hnizdo (Stork Nest), so it would qualify for a European Union subsidy that was meant for small businesses. It would not qualify as part of Babis s Agrofert group of companies which is the largest private employer in the central European country. Babis said it was owned by his family members when the subsidy was awarded. It was folded into Agrofert later. Babis and Faltynek, a former executive at Agrofert companies, face potential prison sentences if the case is brought to court and if they are found guilty. The Slovak-born Babis moved Agrofert and other assets into trust funds earlier this year to meet new conflict of interest legislation. He remains beneficiary of the funds. Apart from police, the European Union s anti-fraud unit OLAF has also been looking into the case. ",

        "title": "China kindergarten sex abuse and 'needlemarks' claims prompt police probe",
        "text": "BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese police are investigating claims of sexual molestation and needlemarks on children at a Beijing kindergarten run by RYB Education Inc, the latest case in a booming childcare industry to spark outrage among parents, sending the company s New York-listed shares tumbling on Friday. The official Xinhua news agency said late on Thursday that police were checking allegations that some teachers and staff at the kindergarten had abused children, who were  reportedly sexually molested, pierced by needles and given unidentified pills . Shares in RYB (RYB.N) plunged 38 percent on the New York Stock Exchange early on Friday, almost wiping out most of the 44 percent rise in the Chinese company s stock since its IPO in September. Parents said their children, some as young as three, relayed troubling accounts of a naked adult male conducting purported  medical check-ups  on students, who were also unclothed, other  media said. Some parents, who gathered outside the school to demand answers on Thursday, said their children gave matching accounts of being fed unidentified tablets and of punishments where students were  made to stand  naked in class, media said. The welfare of children in professional care has become a hot-button issue in China, where a string of high-profile cases of abuse has underlined lax regulations and supervision in the childcare and early learning industry.  We deeply apologise for the serious anxiety this matter has brought to parents and society,  RYB said in a statement on its official microblog on Friday, adding that it was helping authorities.  We are currently working with the police to provide relevant surveillance materials and equipment; the teachers in question have been suspended and we are co-operating with the police investigation,  it said. The school s principal had lodged a police report against  individuals who have engaged in false accusations and framing , it said, without elaborating. Beijing police did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. In a statement before its shares opened trade on Friday, RYB said it was planning a $50 million share buy-back programme and had established a special task force led by independent company directors to do a  thorough self-inspection across all teaching facilities . China s education ministry has begun a special investigation into the operation of kindergartens, it said in a statement on Thursday, and told education departments nationwide to  take warning from these types of incidents . Separate incidents in China of children being slapped, beaten with a stick and having their mouths sealed shut with duct tape have also gone viral and fuelled anger online. News of the investigation into the Beijing kindergarten triggered a wave of outrage on social media, with more than 76 million mentions of  RYB  on Tencent Holdings Ltd s (0700.HK) WeChat messaging service on Thursday.  These may be individual cases but the deeper problems they reflect cannot be overlooked,  a Xinhua editorial said.  Laws must be enforced, supervision strengthened, teacher wages increased. The childcare industry cannot be allowed to grow in an uncivilised fashion.  Chinese education providers have been attracting major investment, while others have sought global listings, latching onto fast-growing demand from parents for high-end education services. Before Friday, shares in RYB had been up about 44 percent since a September New York listing, giving it a market value of nearly $766 million. This was not the first case of alleged abuse at an RYB school.  In 2015, a court in Jilin province found two teachers guilty of physically abusing children at one of its kindergartens in the city of Siping. In that case, staff at the school on  multiple occasions used needles and intimidation tactics to abuse many of the children under their care , according to the court ruling document. Earlier this year, RYB said it had found  serious mistakes  at another one of its Beijing schools and had asked the principal to step down after videos emerged showing teachers hitting and pushing children.  State television broadcast images of police and angry parents gathered outside the school in Beijing on Thursday, calling for answers.  On Friday, one father leaving the school said he had been there to cancel his son s enrolment and demand a refund.  Another parent, 36-year-old Wang Siqi, said she took the day off work to demand answers, even though her six-year-old son does not attend the school.   As a mother when I saw this news I really couldn t take it,  she said.  This is unforgivable.  RYB says on its website it runs a network of more than 1,300 directly owned and franchised play-and-learn centres and nearly 500 kindergartens for children up to age six in about 300 Chinese cities and towns.

        "title": "Democratic opposition to U.S. high court nominee grows",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A third of Democratic senators have so far announced they will vote against confirming U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, adding to a chorus of opposition from the left, but leaving questions over whether there will be a concerted effort to block a vote in the Senate. To date, 16 of the 48 Democratic senators have publicly backed their leader, Chuck Schumer, who said on Thursday he opposes confirming appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch. Others have yet to announce their intentions.  Gorsuch is headed toward a Senate Judiciary Committee vote, likely on April 3, on his nomination to the high court after a marathon four-day confirmation hearing this week.  After that, it is not yet clear how much of a fight Democrats will put up when the nomination is due for a final vote in the 100-member Senate, where there are 52 Republicans.   The Democratic opposition to Gorsuch could prompt a showdown in the Senate and delay the judge\u2019s confirmation but ultimately the Republicans are likely to win that fight and avoid another setback in Congress for Trump who suffered a blow on Friday when lawmakers pulled a major healthcare bill. Senate rules enable Democrats to insist on 60 votes to overcome a procedural move called a filibuster to allow a final up-or-down vote on confirming Gorsuch, 49, to the lifetime job on the nation's highest court. (GRAPHIC - Confirming Gorsuch: How it works tmsnrt.rs/2nANgEj)  But the Senate\u2019s Republican leadership could adopt a rule change allowing a vote that would only require a simple majority of the chamber. If eventually confirmed, Gorsuch would restore a conservative majority on the nine-seat high court. For Democrats, putting up a fight would at least frustrate Trump and placate liberal activists sore about the Republican-led Senate\u2019s refusal to vote on President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to the same open seat on the court last year.  If eventually confirmed, Gorsuch would restore a conservative majority on the nine-seat high court.  Conservative activists were targeting ten Democrats running for reelection in 2018 in states Trump won in the presidential election as possible \u201cyes\u201d votes for Gorsuch among Democrats.  Of that number, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin have already announced their opposition to the nomination. The other seven, including Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have yet to announce their plans. Another Democratic senator under pressure from both sides on Gorsuch is Michael Bennet, who represents Gorsuch\u2019s home state of Colorado. Bennet has yet to announce his position. Republicans are also hopeful that some Democratic members of the judiciary committee, including Chris Coons of Delaware and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, might be wary of blocking a vote on the nominee. Their spokesmen did not respond to requests seeking comment. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it would be an \u201cunprecedented, even nuclear step\u201d to require a 60-vote threshold before the Senate can vote on the nominee. \u201cThere has never, in the history of the Republic, ever been a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee,\u201d he added. The last attempt to filibuster a nominee was a Democratic bid to block a vote on Justice Samuel Alito, who was nominated by President George W. Bush in 2005. Democrats failed to gather enough support and the Senate voted 72-25 to proceed to an up-or-down vote. Alito was eventually confirmed by 58-42.  Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University, said Democrats may be able to gather enough support to block a vote because so few of them are moderates from Republican-leaning states, meaning they may feel they have little to lose. If Trump\u2019s popularity drops, that could embolden them further, she added.    ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Fiji warned on Friday it faces soaring costs to protect itself from climate change and called on the world to do more to curb carbon emissions to protect poor island nations from the increasing threat of floods and cyclones. In a report done with the World Bank, the South Pacific nation said it is spending almost 10 percent of its gross domestic product to guard against natural disasters, more than quadruple the level of five years ago. The report assessing the country s vulnerability to climate risks was released to coincide with Fiji chairing the COP23 global climate summit taking place in Bonn.  As the President of the COP23 and on behalf of the small island nations ... Fiji is asking the world for drastic action ... so that climate change does not impose a limit to our development,  Fijian Prime minister Voreque Bainimarama said in the report. Fiji is set to spend more than 350 million Fiji dollars ($168 million) this year on relocating villages, building improved bridges and roads and on responding to natural disasters, expected to become more frequent and severe due to climate change.  This is up from just over 50 million Fiji dollars, just over 2 percent of GDP, in 2013, the report said.   With increasing risks to the people and economy of Fiji due to climate change, finding the capacity to respond will only become more challenging,  it said. The risks include rising sea-levels, more floods and landslides, destruction of crops and farm equipment and increases in diseases such as Dengue fever, leptospirosis, and typhoid. The effects of climate change already cost the nation around 5 percent of its GDP every year, with the heaviest impact on the farm sector. Fiji is still reeling from Tropical Cyclone Winston in March 2016, the most powerful storm to make landfall in the southern hemisphere. The storm killed more than 40 people and caused 2 billion Fiji dollars in damage. ($1 = 2.0794 Fiji dollars) ",

        "title": "Gerry Adams: Face of IRA who helped cement Northern Ireland peace",
        "text": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - As the public face of the Irish Republican Army during its bombing campaigns, then peacemaker and mainstream politician, Gerry Adams has been a defining figure of Northern Ireland s 50-year journey from sectarian torment to relative stability. Adams announced his intention to step down as leader of the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party on Saturday with his ultimate goal of a united Ireland still elusive. But the party he leaves is not only the dominant Irish nationalist force in the British-ruled province, but also strong enough across the border in the Irish Republic to have a chance of entering government there, too. During the 1970s and 80s, at the height of an IRA bombing campaign to end British rule over Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein operated as the IRA s political wing. As its leader from 1983 onwards, Adams thus became, for many in Britain and Northern Ireland, the face of the IRA. As a result, he was loathed by pro-British unionists and the British government, but lionized in equal measure by Irish nationalists. Yet when the prospect of political progress arose, he showed himself ready to compromise, working with late former IRA commander Martin McGuinness to swing the IRA and the province s Roman Catholic minority behind a 1998 deal with the pro-British Protestant majority. The Good Friday agreement gave the province s Catholics a share of power and largely ended a conflict in which some 3,600 people had been killed, many at the hands of Irish republican groups such as the IRA, and others by pro-British unionist paramilitaries and British security forces.  Since then, Adams has helped to build Sinn Fein into the dominant Irish nationalist party in Northern Ireland, overseeing its agreement in 2007 to share power with its bitter rival, the Democratic Unionist Party and, in recent months, its efforts to restore power-sharing after it collapsed in January.  Adams also announced on Saturday that he would not stand for re-election to the Dublin parliament, where he has sat since 2011, moving Sinn Fein from the fringes to become the Irish Republic s third party and its main left-wing force.  Adams was born into a Belfast family steeped in revolutionary politics, several of his relatives having been involved in armed republicanism. At 20, he left his job as a barman to help defend fellow Catholics from what they saw as a hostile British state, and to fight for Northern Ireland to split from the United Kingdom and unite with the Irish Republic.   Like his father, Adams was interned - held without trial - on suspicion of being a senior IRA commander.  He has always denied membership of the IRA, although accusations from former IRA fighters that he was involved in its campaign of killings have dogged him throughout his career.  Between 1988 and 1994, Adams was banned from speaking on British airwaves. While his oversized glasses and red-tinged beard were instantly recognizable, his voice was unknown as broadcasters had actors dub his words. Former British conservative prime minister John Major, one of the architects of peace in Northern Ireland, once said the thought of sitting down to talk with Adams had  turned my stomach .  But Adams was at the time walking a political tightrope - between IRA  hawks  who argued that only a continuation of violence would chase Britain from the island, and  doves  who said that negotiations were the route to a united Ireland. He emerged from the political cold in October 1997 when he shook hands with the new Labour prime minister, Tony Blair, at their first meeting. Sinn Fein had polled 17 percent in Northern Ireland s elections and returned Adams to the British parliament, although he refused to take his seat.  Within a year, Adams and McGuinness had helped to broker a peace deal that largely ended the violence in the province. Since that deal, his role as statesman has grown, and he has made several visits to the White House.  He was arrested in 2014 as part of an investigation into one of the province s most controversial murders, but no charges were brought. Latterly he has used social media to create a grandfatherly image in the Irish Republic, with posts about his dog and his taste in cartoons. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Most Americans want the media to present facts in news stories without adding interpretation, a Pew Research Center survey said on Friday amid a debate in the media about its role in covering Donald Trump\u2019s unconventional presidential campaign. Journalists face the issue of how much guidance they should provide to help their audiences make sense of the news. The question is especially keen after the 2016 election when the media grappled with challenging false statements made by Republican Trump in his campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Fifty-nine percent of U.S. adults reject the idea of adding interpretation, saying that the news media should present the facts alone, the survey showed. Four in 10 favored adding some interpretation to the facts. \u201cAlthough the public prefers the news media to present \u2018just the facts,\u2019 they may not even agree on what the facts are,\u201d Pew said in a statement. In the same survey, 81 percent of registered voters said that most supporters of Clinton and Trump not only disagreed over plans and policies, but also disagreed on basic facts. Voters who supported Trump, now the president-elect, favored a \u201cjust the facts\u201d approach by 71 percent to 29 percent. Clinton supporters were evenly split on the issue. The survey showed strong support for fact-checking by the media. The election campaign saw a proliferation of fake news sites and articles on social media competing with news published by traditional media, although this was not included in the survey. Eighty-one percent of those who prefer facts without interpretation believe fact-checking is a major or minor responsibility of the news media. Among those who prefer interpretation, 83 percent think fact-checking is a responsibility. The survey of 4,132 adults was conducted from Sept. 27 to Oct. 10, before Election Day. The margin of error is 2.8 percentage points. ",

        "title": "Federal judges question intent behind North Carolina voting law",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal appeals court judges on Tuesday probed the intent behind a sweeping 2013 North Carolina law that changed the state\u2019s election rules. A lawyer for the state, Thomas Farr, defended the law and denied claims by attorneys for the U.S. Justice Department and civil rights groups that the law intentionally suppressed minority voters, speaking before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia. The court already temporarily stayed the law\u2019s provisions that eliminate voters\u2019 ability to register the same day they vote and to vote outside their assigned precincts, methods that critics say are disproportionately used by minority voters. If the appeals court follows a lower court\u2019s April ruling and upholds the law, those options may not be available for North Carolina voters in the upcoming election in November, widely viewed as one of the most critical presidential and general elections in recent U.S. history. Judge Henry Floyd asked Farr about the fact that the legislature considered an expanded version of the law soon after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Shelby County v. Holder that Congress could no longer subject states with a record of race-based voter discrimination to special elections oversight. North Carolina\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature got the \u201copportunity\u201d to change some \u201cpretty liberal voter registration provisions\u201d with that decision, Floyd said.  \u201cAnd it happened the same day Shelby was decided. Looks pretty bad to me, in terms of purposeful discrimination,\u201d he added. Judge James Wynn asked Farr what type of voter behavior information the state legislature considered when passing the law: \u201cAt the time that it enacted this, did it have ... information that the use of these particular procedures was disproportionately higher in the minority community than they were in the non-minority community?\u201d  Farr replied that the state board of elections launched a campaign to educate voters about the new requirements. \u201cWhen these rules were used in 2014 election, African-American turnout increased at a higher rate than whites,\u201d Farr told Reuters by email after the hearing. Attorneys for the civil rights groups opposing the law appeared jubilant afterwards, greeting supporters outside the courthouse and at a local church in Richmond, where NAACP members sang, spoke and answered questions from reporters. \u201cThe judges asked really probing questions to understand the crux of the matter,\u201d said Allison Riggs, a lawyer for the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. \u201cThe court below just got the law wrong.\u201d ",

        "text": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia s world-famous Uluru, formerly known as Ayers Rock, will be closed to climbers from 2019, its management board said on Wednesday, ending a decades-long campaign by Aborigines to protect their sacred monolith in the Northern Territory. A board of eight traditional owners and four government officials voted unanimously to close the rock to climbers, a spokesperson told Reuters.  The climb is a men s sacred area, the men have closed it,  chairman Sammy Wilson added in a statement.  It has cultural significance that includes certain restrictions.   The UNESCO World Heritage-listed 348-metre (1,142 ft) rock, known for its shifting red-ochre colors, is a top tourist drawcard, attracting around 300,000 visitors each year, despite its remote desert location near Alice Springs. The traditional owners of Uluru, the Anangu people, have called for the climb to be closed since 1985, when the park was placed in indigenous hands.  The rock s board said in a report in 2010 that they would close the attraction to climbers if the proportion of visitors who tried to climb it dropped below 20 percent. They took the matter to a vote on Wednesday after data showed the number of climbers had fallen below that threshold, from about three quarters throughout the 1990s to just 16.2 per cent between 2011 and 2015. The ban will take effect on Oct. 26, 2019, exactly 34 years after Uluru was handed back to its traditional owners. Australians are still the most common visitors to climb the rock, followed by the Japanese, according to Parks Australia. The climb is closed about 77 percent of the time due to dangerous weather or cultural reasons.  There have been 36 confirmed fatalities at Uluru since records were first kept in the 1950s, with the most recent in 2010. (This story has been refiled to fix typo in first paragraph) ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat on the U.S. Senate committee overseeing pensions on Monday asked the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to assess whether President Donald Trump is violating the Constitution and federal bans on conflicts of interest. Reuters reported on April 26 that public pension funds in at least seven U.S. states periodically send millions of dollars to an investment fund that owns the upscale Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium in New York City and pays a Trump company to run it, according to a Reuters review of public records. \u201cTrump may be profiting from the retirement plans of millions of our nation\u2019s public servants,\u201d Senator Patty Murray of Washington state wrote in a letter to Walter Shaub, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, citing the Reuters report. The Office of Government Ethics is the U.S. agency that oversees conduct within the executive branch and supervises ethics officials to ensure they are preventing conflicts of interest and other violations. \u201cThis looks like exactly the type of monetary flow prohibited by the Constitution,\u201d said the senator. Murray, who is on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, asked Shaub to assess what steps Trump can take to ensure he is in compliance with Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which bars the president from receiving additional payments beyond his salary from state governments.  The fees that public pension funds pay the CIM Fund III investment fund that owns the Trump SoHo may fall into that category, several constitutional lawyers have told Reuters. The White House, the Trump Organization, and the Office of Government Ethics did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  At a January news conference at which Trump said he would turn over management of his companies to a trust controlled by his two elder sons, his lawyer, Sheri Dillon, said divesting from his businesses would \u201cexacerbate\u201d potential conflicts of interest because Trump would still be entitled to royalties from the use of his brand. Some of the pension funds have said Trump or the investment fund that owns the hotel should answer concerns about the chain because they do not have control over the assets in the investment fund\u2019s portfolio. Others declined to comment on the payment chain between them and Trump.  Other Democratic U.S. senators have criticized the president for not divesting his hotel management company and the hundreds of other businesses that make up the Trump Organization. Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said Trump was setting \u201can extremely dangerous precedent\u201d by maintaining ownership. ",

        "title": "Senate takes step toward passage of tax bill, vote likely this week",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday took a step toward passage of tax legislation that is a top White House priority, setting up a likely decisive vote later this week even though it was unclear if the bill had enough Republican support to become law.Republicans spent the day scrambling to reformulate the  bill, which aims to cut taxes on corporations, other businesses and many individuals and families, to satisfy lawmakers worried about how much it would balloon the U.S. budget deficit. Stocks rallied on optimism it could pass, but obstacles remained, including attempts to address the estimated $1.4 trillion that the bill would add to the United States\u2019 $20 trillion national debt over 10 years. Lawmakers voted 52-48 to begin formal debate, a step that could lead on Thursday and Friday to a full vote on the bill. Republicans are eager to pass the legislation, wanting something to show for their control of the White House and both houses of Congress. Republicans have a 52-48 majority in the 100-member Senate, giving them enough votes to approve the bill if they can hold together. Without Democratic support, Republicans can afford to lose no more than two of their own votes. President Donald Trump in a speech in Missouri on Wednesday, implored members of his own party to get behind the effort, which would be his first significant legislative achievement since taking office in January. \u201cA vote to cut taxes is a vote to put America first again,\u201d Trump said, adding the bill could \u201ccost me a fortune\u201d and that his wealthy friends were not happy. \u201cMy accountants are going crazy right now. It\u2019s all right. Hey look, I am president, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care anymore.\u201d Democrats say the tax cuts are a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy at the expense of working Americans. Some Democrats have said Trump and his children would gain from the bill, which would repeal the estate tax on inherited wealth.   Among Americans aware of the Republican tax plan, 49 percent said they were opposed, up from 41 percent in October, according to a Nov. 23-27 Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday. The latest online poll of 1,257 adults found 29 percent supporting the plan and 22 percent saying they \u201cdon\u2019t know.\u201d The sweeping tax package was developed over several months behind closed doors by a small group of senior congressional and Trump administration figures, with little input from many Republican lawmakers and no involvement from Democrats. A major sticking point in the Senate is how the bill deals with the federal deficit and the national debt. Senator Bob Corker, one of the few remaining fiscal hawks in the Republican Party, wants to add a tax snap-back provision to the bill that would raise taxes automatically if economic growth targets are not hit in the future to offset a higher deficit. That trigger proposal has become a target of growing criticism among conservative Republicans and lobbyists, including interest groups aligned with the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, who say the prospect of tax hikes could undermine future economic growth. \u201cI\u2019d prefer not having it there. We\u2019re probably going to have one. But I\u2019d prefer not having it,\u201d Republican Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch told reporters. Republican Senator David Perdue, a businessman from Georgia, said lawmakers could find common ground on a measure that delays any tax hike for at least five years and spreads the prospective burden among those who benefit from Republican tax cuts. Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, suggested such an approach may be gaining ground. \u201cIt looks like the idea is part way through the first 10 years, there\u2019d be an opportunity to see if the economic growth numbers are performing as expected. And if not, there would be a trigger mechanism over a 10-year period,\u201d Portman said. Democrats and independents were trying to persuade nonpartisan Senate officials to disqualify parts of the bill, including one to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as impermissible under Senate rules, an aide said. While some Republicans signaled determination to get the bill passed, they still did not have the votes. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to saddle up and ride. And I\u2019m ready to go,\u201d Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana told reporters. Corker declined to say whether he would vote for the tax bill even if Senate Republican leaders agree to the kind of trigger mechanism he wants. \u201cI don\u2019t do conjecture,\u201d he told reporters, saying he could have other concerns about the final legislation. \u201cThere are also qualitative issues like the bill not getting any worse, that it doesn\u2019t get more expensive.\u201d ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday left in place a lower court\u2019s ruling that barred private citizens from suing Ohio for allegedly impeding their ability to vote by requiring ballot forms to be filled out perfectly. The justices declined to review the ruling that dismissed claims by Ohio\u2019s Democratic Party and homeless rights groups that the state\u2019s \u201cperfect form\u201d law, which invalidates ballots for even minor errors, deprived thousands of people of their right to vote, violating the federal Voting Rights Act. Such suits must be filed by the federal government, not private citizens, that court held.  The Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless in Cleveland, the Columbus Coalition for the Homeless and the state Democratic Party challenged a pair of 2014 laws. Those laws required county election boards to reject absentee and provisional ballots unless voters had properly and completely filled out the forms that come with the ballots, including with their name, address, birth date and signature.  Ballots were rejected even if the voter\u2019s identity could be determined despite the errors, the plaintiffs told the justices in legal papers. Some were thrown out for omitting zip codes, using cursive writing instead of print, or writing in the current date instead of a birth date, they said, disenfranchising thousands of voters in recent elections, especially minorities.  The plaintiffs claimed the laws were unconstitutional, violating voters\u2019 rights to due process and equal protection under the law. They also alleged the laws violated a provision of the Voting Rights Act that outlaws voter disqualification for errors that are \u201cnot material\u201d to determining voter eligibility. Last September the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the laws to be mostly legal, striking down only the requirement that absentee voters accurately provide their full address and birth date. The court also said the Voting Rights Act provision at issue could only be enforced by the U.S. attorney general, and lawsuits by private parties were barred.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on Monday confirmed a Reuters report that he was considering a proposal to separate women and children who cross the U.S. border with Mexico illegally, a policy shift he said was aimed at deterring people from making a dangerous journey. Kelly was asked in a CNN interview about the proposal, first reported by Reuters on Friday, in which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would change U.S. policy and keep parents in custody while putting children in the care of the Health and Human Services Department. \u201cYes, I am considering - in order to deter more movement along this terribly dangerous network - I am considering exactly that,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe have tremendous experience in dealing with unaccompanied minors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be well cared for as we deal with their parents.\u201d The policy change would allow the government to keep parents in custody while they contest deportation or wait for asylum hearings. Children would be put into the \u201cleast restrictive setting\u201d until they can be taken into the care of a U.S. relative or state-sponsored guardian, said government officials who were briefed on the proposal. Currently, families contesting deportation or applying for asylum are generally released from detention quickly and allowed to remain in the United States until their cases are resolved. A federal appeals court ruling bars prolonged child detention. \u201cLet me start by saying I would do almost anything to deter the people from Central America from getting on this very, very dangerous network that brings them up through Mexico into the United States,\u201d Kelly said. He said social service organizations have told him that more than 90 percent of the women making the journey from Central America are sexually abused. U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat whose district includes about 200 miles (320 km) of the border with Mexico, slammed the DHS proposal. \u201cBottom line: separating mothers and children is wrong,\u201d he said in a statement on Friday. \u201cThat type of thing is where we depart from border security and get into violating human rights,\u201d he said. About 54,000 children and their guardians were apprehended between Oct. 1, 2016, and Jan. 31, 2017, more than double the number caught over the same period a year earlier. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican who helped block her party\u2019s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act this year, said she planned to remain in her current office rather than run for governor. The four-term incumbent attracted national attention this summer as one of three Republican senators who voted in July against a bill to repeal the law often called Obamacare, a move that angered U.S. President Donald Trump. She said on Friday that remaining in the Senate would allow her to use her powerful voice in reforming the U.S healthcare system. Collins, who like all Republicans in the Senate in 2009 voted against the sweeping healthcare legislation, said she believed urgent action was needed to improve it but criticized the way repeal efforts had been handled over the summer. \u201cWhen we\u2019re dealing with an issue that affects millions of Americans, we need to understand the consequences of what we are doing, not vote on bills in the middle of the night that have had no substantive hearings,\u201d Collins, 64, told a group of business leaders in Rockland, a city on the state\u2019s midcoast.  \u201cWe must stop allowing partisanship to be the pre-existing condition that prevents meaningful healthcare reform.\u201d Urgent action is needed to stabilize the insurance markets, including creating high-risk pools, she said. She wants to require employers to offer healthcare coverage only to people who work 40 hours a week or more, raising the threshold from 30 hours. For weeks, Collins had flirted publicly with the idea of launching a bid to succeed Governor Paul LePage, a fiery conservative first elected in 2010 on a wave of support from the populist Tea Party movement. State laws forbid LePage from seeking a third term. Collins and LePage mark out the two poles of the state\u2019s Republican Party. Collins\u2019 independence makes her an increasingly powerful player in Washington, one veteran Maine political observer said. \u201cShe is at the very center of virtually every big policy debate and big vote in the U.S. Senate,\u201d said Mark Brewer, professor of political science at the University of Maine. \u201cShe remains an incredibly important player on any issue she wants to focus on.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell welcomed the news: \u201cHer decision to remain in the Senate is important not only for the people of Maine, who she serves so well, but for the nation as a whole.\u201d ",

The Democratic presidential front-runner, whose campaign ran off the rails in Iowa in 2008 against Barack Obama, was dealt another setback on Monday in the Midwestern state that begins the 2016 race for the presidency. The former secretary of state, Clinton, 68, was pushed to a virtual tie with Sanders, a 74-year-old U.S. senator from Vermont. Next up is New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Feb. 9. Sanders has been leading in opinion polls there and has an advantage because it neighbors his home state.

Her subdued, six-minute speech contrasted with the ebullient tone of Sanders\u2019 16-minute speech.  With no clear victory to announce, Clinton\u2019s campaign scrapped a plan to have her daughter Chelsea and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, introduce her. They stood alongside her instead, with Bill Clinton wearing his campaign logo badge upside-down. Aides removed the TelePrompter at the last minute, supporters at the Drake University rally told Reuters, in a further indication of last-minute changes in plans. While the race in Iowa had tightened in recent weeks, her aides had appeared to draw some confidence from a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg politics poll over the weekend that showed Clinton with a three-percentage-point lead over Sanders among likely caucus-goers. Into the early hours of Tuesday morning, Clinton and Sanders remained separated by less than a single percentage point. The race was so tight that several precincts were forced to decide whether Clinton or Sanders got the winning votes - and one more delegate - by a coin toss, following the state Democratic Party\u2019s advice. The MSNBC television network finally called the race for Clinton at nearly 3 a.m. CST (0900 GMT), and Clinton\u2019s Iowa state director Matt Paul issued a statement declaring victory with \u201cno uncertainty.\u201d Opinion polls show Clinton still faces an enthusiasm gap with Sanders and her Republican rivals, whose race attracted a record turnout in Iowa. Voters have persistent doubts about her honesty and trustworthiness after months of controversy over her use of a private email server for government work while secretary of state. Sanders, who launched his campaign nine months ago with a small, sparsely attended news conference on Capitol Hill, has excited liberal activists with an anti-establishment message that calls for eradicating income inequality, breaking up the big banks and providing free college tuition. Iowa was a good state to test that message, given the heavy liberal bent of the Democratic activists who dominate the caucus process. Entrance polls of Iowa caucus-goers showed 68 percent described themselves as very or somewhat liberal. Fundraising figures reported on Sunday by Sanders underscored the extent to which his campaign has grown into a popular movement. Clinton has raised more than Sanders - her campaign brought in $109 million last year compared to his $73.5 million. But 75 percent of his haul came from donations of $200 or less, in contrast to only 18 percent of Clinton\u2019s, and far more of Clinton\u2019s donors have hit the $2,700 donation limit. Still, Sanders faces significant challenges when the Democratic nominating contest moves to the more diverse states of Nevada and South Carolina before expanding to 11 states on March 1, \u201cSuper Tuesday,\u201d including seven in the South where Clinton\u2019s advantage with African-American voters could begin to pay off. \u201cIowa was built for Bernie Sanders,\u201d said Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, who nevertheless said the strong showing by Sanders means \u201cthis race goes on longer than Clinton wanted it to.\u201d  (Additional reporting by Jonathan Allen in Washington; Editing by Caren Bohan and Howard Goller) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has declined an invitation to address the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Wednesday. The White House did not offer any details on why Trump would not speak to the 108-year-old civil rights group. \u201cMy understanding is that the invitation has been declined for this year,\u201d Sanders told reporters at a briefing. She said that while Trump would not speak at the conference, the White House would be happy to have a dialogue with the group.  \u201cWe would certainly like to be able to continue to do that,\u201d Sanders said. The NAACP did not immediately respond to request for comment.  Trump had declined to speak at the NAACP convention last year because it coincided with the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where he was formally nominated as the party\u2019s presidential candidate. Previous Republican presidential nominees regularly attended the annual meetings of the oldest U.S. civil rights organization. Trump\u2019s most recent predecessors in the White House, Barack Obama, a Democrat, and George W. Bush, a Republican, both delivered speeches to the NAACP during their time in office.    This year\u2019s NAACP convention begins Saturday in Baltimore. During his campaign, Trump pledged to improve the lives of black Americans, who voted overwhelmingly in favor of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has been criticized by some groups, including the Congressional Black Caucus, for not doing enough to address issues in the African-American community. ",

        "title": "Pakistan army says state exploring how to integrate militant-linked groups",
        "text": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The Pakistani army on Thursday said the government was discussing ways to try to integrate militant-linked groups into the mainstream of the country s politics. Milli Muslim League (MML), a new militant party controlled by Islamist Hafiz Saeed, backed a candidate in the September by-election for a seat vacated by ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the eastern city of Lahore. The United States has offered a $10 million bounty for Saeed s capture. Reuters reported last month that the foray into politics by MML and other Islamists groups followed the integration plan. Three of Sharif s confidants and a retired army general said it had been presented by Inter Services Intelligence to Sharif last year, but the then premier had rejected it. Army spokesman Major-General Asif Ghafoor did not comment on the military s role in any such strategy but told a news conference in Islamabad the plan was aimed at developing a constructive role for them.  Asked about the MML party loyal to Hafiz Saeed, whom the United States and India accuse of masterminding the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people, the army spokesman said it was part of  a process that has started .   It is in my knowledge that the government has started some discussion over it, that, how do we mainstream them, so that they could do constructive contribution,  Ghafoor said.  A government spokesman did not respond to calls. Pakistan s interior ministry has asked the country s electoral commission not to register Saeed s party, but hasn t taken any other steps to stop it. Another militant party is  campaigning for a by-election later in October. It remains unclear whether the army or the ISI went ahead with its plan despite Sharif s rejection, or if the military and the civilian government have recently agreed on the idea. Another Islamist designated a terrorist by the United States, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, told Reuters he too planned to form his own party soon.  Within two weeks of Sharif s ouster, the MML party was announced. It later got the backing of Saeed and his lieutenants in the by-election to secure five per cent of the vote. The other hardline party, Tehrik-e-Labaik Pakistan, gained over six per cent of votes by riding on the back of a blasphemy killer Mumtaz Qadri whom it called a hero and a martyr.  Saeed has been under house arrest since January in the eastern city of Lahore.  MML is the political wing of Saeed s charity Jamaat-ud-Dawa, JuD. JuD and Khalil s Ansar ul-Umma organization are both seen by the United States as fronts for militant groups the army has been accused of sponsoring against neighbors, arch-foe India and Afghanistan - a charge the army denies. Reports of the plan to bring militant-linked groups into the political mainstream have stirred debate at home and abroad.  Now, how to take it further - that, the time to come will tell,  Ghafoor, the army spokesman  said,  For that, the government will take a decision.    ",

        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers have raised concerns over money laundering in Malta and the independence of its police and judiciary in a draft resolution, stepping up pressure on the island after the assassination of an investigative journalist. Daphne Caruana Galizia, who had denounced high-profile corruption and accused Prime Minister Joseph Muscat of wrongdoing, was killed on Oct. 16 by a bomb that tore through her car.  An investigation is under way and Muscat has promised that everything will be done to find the killers. Next week the EU parliament will vote on a resolution on the rule of law in Malta. In a draft text, seen by Reuters, the parliament said it  regrets that developments in Malta in recent years have led to serious concerns about the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights including freedom of the media and the independence of the police and judiciary . It said that  the independence of law enforcement and the judiciary in Malta may be compromised by the fact that the government is empowered to appoint the Police Commissioner, the head of the FIAU (anti-money laundering agency) and the attorney-general . The resolution called on the European Commission to oversee more closely respect for the rule of law in Malta and regretted the EU executive s decision not to publish its anti-corruption report this year. At a news conference on Friday, the largest group in the parliament, the conservative European People s Party (EPP), called on the EU commission to  urgently  step up its monitoring of Malta.  We think there are serious questions regarding the freedom of media and the lack of law enforcement in Malta,  said Daniel Koster, an EPP spokesman. He said the EPP had doubts about what the commission was doing to address this situation. The calls from the conservatives were echoed by the liberal, leftist and green groupings in the assembly. Reports from the Maltese anti-money laundering agency were leaked in June via Caruana Galizia s blog. They raised concerns about Pilatus Bank, a Maltese lender accused of having failed to report suspicious dealings as required by law. The EU lawmakers  draft resolution calls on Malta to investigate Pilatus Bank. The bank and the Maltese police did not reply to Reuters  questions on the allegations.  There appear to be no grounds to suspect a systematic breach,  of money laundering rules in Malta, an EU Commission official told Reuters in reply to questions over the island s application of EU rules on money laundering. The draft resolution, citing findings of the parliament s inquiry committee on money laundering, said Maltese institutions in charge of enforcing rules to prevent financial crimes were  highly politicized .  The number of convictions and confiscations related to money laundering in Malta seems extremely low,  it said. ",

        "text": "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A New Zealand navy vessel will ferry diesel fuel around the country as the government rushes to alleviate a days-long fuel shortage that has cast air travel into disarray in the run-up to Saturday s national election. The ship would transport up to 4.8 million liters of diesel - equivalent to 150 tankers - to enable industry to focus on providing jet fuel to crisis-hit Auckland airport, Energy and Resources Minister Judith Collins said on Thursday. More than 120 flights have been canceled in New Zealand s largest city this week, disrupting thousands of travelers each day after damage to the single privately owned pipeline that carries jet fuel from a refinery to the city s airport.  The government will continue to do everything it can to support industry efforts to address the disruption,  Collins said in statement. New Zealand s government and industry have taken a series of measures to try to contain the crisis, from fuel rationing to calling on the military to help truck in supplies of fuel, and have set up an industry government group to handle the fallout. Another 14 flights were canceled on Thursday, according to Auckland Airport, but that was less than half the number of flights canceled on Wednesday.   Generally what we are seeing is the cancellations across the industry have stabilized,  said Justin Tighe-Umbers, executive director of the Board of Airline Representatives New Zealand. The ordeal has become a headache for the ruling National Party which is battling it out with the newly invigorated  Labour Party to form the next government. The latest poll showed National with a near 10 point lead over Labour, but polls have been volatile and at times have shown Labour with a comfortable winning margin. Jacinda Ardern, which has almost single-handedly boosted Labour s chances since taking over the leadership in August, has criticized the government for not having taken measures to avoid the kind of infrastructure failure that led to the disruptive fuel shortage. Overnight, Australia s Qantas Airways operated two flights from Australia, nicknamed  fuel mules , carrying fuel to top up Jetstar and Qantas aircraft in Auckland, the airline said.  One was a scheduled A330 passenger service that carried an extra 10,000 kilograms of fuel, while the other was a special 747 flight with 65,000 kilograms of fuel aboard, it said. ",

        "text": "ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry hailed Mongolia as an \u201coasis of democracy\u201d sitting in a tough location between Russia and China as he made a rare visit by a cabinet-level U.S. official on Sunday. Arriving from Paris, Kerry made the visit to Mongolia en route to Beijing to attend the eighth Strategic and Economic Dialogue, the high-level talks held between the United States and China each year. The Obama administration has sought to cultivate Mongolia as a partner, given its location between two increasingly assertive U.S. rivals \u2013 China and Russia, countries Mongolia relies on heavily for trade and energy imports. U.S. officials regularly tout Mongolia, a country of three million people, as an inspirational story of democratic transition since winning independence from the Soviet Union a quarter-century ago. \u201cYou really set a great example,\u201d Kerry told Mongolian and American embassy staff at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence. \u201cYou\u2019ve got China on one side of you, and Russia on the other side of you, and there are always a lot of pressures, and here you are in this oasis of democracy fighting for your own identity.\u201d But Mongolia\u2019s democratic and human rights records have come under scrutiny. The 2015 State Department report on human rights in Mongolia noted \u201cvague laws and a lack of transparency in legislative, executive, and judicial processes\u201d that \u201cundermined government efficiency and public confidence and invited corruption.\u201d Parliamentary elections are to be held this month, and democracy advocates have criticized a rule change by parliament last month that is expected to disadvantage smaller parties. The lack of transparency in business regulations has hampered foreign investment, officials say, badly needed in an economy where growth has all but halted, far from a peak of 17.5 percent in 2011.  Falling prices for its chief exports, coal and copper, and weak demand from China, by far Mongolia\u2019s biggest trading partner, are behind the slowdown. Kerry said it was important the Mongolian government implement a transparency agreement with the United States, which would provide greater business confidence to foreign investors.  The Mongolian and U.S. governments signed the agreement in 2013 after years of negotiations but its final implementation has been mired in red tape.  The agreement would commit Mongolia to publish in English an explanation for proposed regulations, and allow for public comments on those regulations, among other measures. \u201cThe implementation of this agreement is really key, a very important step to be able to attract foreign direct investment,\u201d Kerry said.

        "text": "HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban President Raul Castro made it clear to a visiting U.S. congressional delegation that his country was intent on pursuing market reform and detente with the United States, U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy told a news conference on Wednesday. Leahy, a Democrat who has been key in efforts to normalize relations, was leading a bipartisan group of five U.S. senators and a representative on a three-day visit to the Communist-run island to discuss ties and explore business opportunities. Cuba watchers are looking closely for signs of how the fragile U.S. detente with Cuba will fare under Republican President Donald Trump, who has threatened to backtrack on it if he does not get \u201ca better deal.\u201d Analysts say Cuba has played its cards well so far by not responding shrilly to such provocation and demonstrating its continued willingness to engage under the new president. Castro \u201cwants reform to continue, he wants the movement forwards to continue,\u201d said Leahy at the news conference in the U.S. embassy, after meeting with the Cuban president on Tuesday. \u201cThe number of people he had from his administration talk to us made it very clear they want us to continue.\u201d The delegation met with Cuba\u2019s foreign, trade and agriculture ministers as well as with Castro. The group included Republican Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi who on Monday oversaw the signing of agreements between Cuba and two Mississippi ports. \u201cIncreasingly this issue of normalizing relations with Cuba is bipartisan, this isn\u2019t just Democrats, there are a lot of Republicans that believe we ought to do this as well,\u201d said Representative James McGovern, a Democrat. Support for the detente was also growing among the business and academic communities, said McGovern, who was traveling with a group of U.S. biotech experts keen to explore the sector in Cuba. \u201cThe movement is more significant in the U.S.A. today than at any time in my career in the Senate,\u201d said Leahy. \u201cAnd I am the dean of the Senate, I have been there the longest,\u201d added Leahy, who was first elected to the Senate in 1974.  The White House said earlier this month that the Trump administration was in the midst of \u201ca full review of all U.S. policies towards Cuba.\u201d The visit came as a diplomatic incident highlighted continuing concerns about restrictions on human rights on the island. Cuban authorities prevented the head of the Organization of American States (OAS), a former Chilean minister and an ex-president of Mexico from traveling to Cuba to attend an award ceremony on Wednesday hosted by dissidents. Cuba opposes anything that legitimizes dissidents, who it claims are mercenaries funded by foreign interests. It also views the OAS as an imperialist instrument of the United States. OAS chief Luis Almagro reported that Cuban authorities said they were \u201castonished\u201d at his involvement in \u201canti-Cuban activities\u201d which were \u201can unacceptable provocation.\u201d A U.S. embassy official attended the ceremony, organized by the Latin American Network of Youth for Democracy, a group opposed to the Communist government. Almagro\u2019s seat was left empty in symbolic protest. \u201cIt may not be the smoothest of paths but it will continue,\u201d Leahy said of the U.S.-Cuban detente. \u201cI would not be here today on one more trip if I didn\u2019t think that continuation of that progress is inevitable.\u201d ",

        "title": "White House denies Trump order on biofuels program pending, markets roiled",
        "text": "(Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday denied that President Donald Trump planned to issue an executive order to change the national biofuels program, after the U.S. Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) said Trump\u2019s team had informed the group an order was pending. Trading in U.S. refinery shares, fuel futures and corn prices was turbulent on the news of the pending order and its subsequent denial, as investors puzzled over what it would mean for the price of gasoline, ethanol and shares of companies that produce them. The RFA issued a statement early on Tuesday that said a member of the Trump administration had called to inform the group the president intended to sign an executive order that would shift the onus on combining biofuels with gasoline away from refiners. The order would require companies further down the supply chain, such as retailers who sell gasoline, to shoulder that load. Refiners have long requested this change, saying the biofuels program has hammered their profits.  White House spokeswoman Kelly Love, however, said on Tuesday afternoon \u201cthere is no ethanol executive order in the works.\u201d Ethanol and fuel retail groups reacted quickly to the reports. Trump\u2019s regulation adviser, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, is majority owner of CVR Energy (CVI.N), a refining company that would benefit from the change. That stock is up 80 percent since Trump\u2019s election in November. Even after the White House denial, RFA Chief Executive Officer Bob Dinneen stuck by his statement, saying there is \u201ccertainly something in the works, but they\u2019re not going to confirm it until they are ready to roll with it.\u201d He declined to identify who in the Trump administration contacted the association. \u201cDespite our continued opposition to the move, we were told the executive order was not negotiable,\u201d Dinneen said. The Renewable Fuel Standard requires fuel companies to use increasing amounts of biofuel blended with gasoline and diesel. Former U.S. President Barack Obama expanded the rules, which started under his predecessor, George W. Bush, when gasoline prices were near records. Refineries without operations designed to blend biofuels such as ethanol into gasoline have to pay for renewable fuel credits, known as RINs, to meet U.S. environmental standards to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The cost for refiners has increased sharply in the last few years; nine major publicly traded refiners paid $2.5 billion in 2016 for RINs costs, a 78 percent increase from 2015.  Among those that have pushed for the change is Icahn, who holds an 82 percent stake of CVR. That company\u2019s shares jumped on Tuesday before paring gains after the White House denial; they ended up 3.5 percent on the day to $22.92 a share, on heavier-than-usual trading volume of 1.7 million shares.  Icahn was unavailable for comment, and CVR declined to comment.  Emily Skor, CEO of biofuel trade group Growth Energy, expressed concern about any role Icahn may have played in planning changes to the program. \u201cI assure you this is no deal for anyone but Carl Icahn,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we had been approached with this deal, we would have flat-out rejected it.\u201d  Seven Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent a letter to the White House this month, saying Icahn\u2019s role as an adviser to Trump created financial conflicts of interest and called for a review.     Shares of U.S. refiner Valero (VLO.N), which would also benefit from the changes, ended up 1 percent on Tuesday to close at $67.95 a share.  Biofuel organizations and groups representing fuel retailers and integrated oil companies like the U.S. units of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and BP Plc (BP.L) have opposed the change, which they say will complicate managing the program.  One source said the RFA was told the executive order would include incentives for ethanol and biodiesel in a tradeoff for the blending shift. Those changes could include a waiver to allow greater volumes of ethanol to be blended into gasoline in the summer, a review of how the Environmental Protection Agency estimates emission impacts of biofuels, and support for a congressional tax credit for domestic producers of biodiesel, the source said. Chicago Board of Trade corn futures Cc1 ended up about 1.7 percent. CBOT soyoil BOc1, which is used for biodiesel, rose 4.8 percent.  Compliance credits used to meet the annual biofuel blending standards traded around 43 cents on Tuesday from 47 cents to 48 cents previously, paring big morning losses. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives on Wednesday unanimously passed legislation to improve safety planning for children who are born dependent on opioid drugs.\u00a0 A similar bill is pending in the Senate. It is one of more than a dozen new measures that are aimed at addressing a U.S. epidemic of addiction to pain pills and cheap heroin. \u00a0 \u00a0 The legislation came in response to a Reuters investigation last year, titled \u201cHelpless and Hooked,\u201d which revealed that at least 110 babies had died since 2010 after being born dependent or exposed to opioids and sent home with parents ill-prepared to care for them. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that stories like these could be any more tragic,\u201d Rep. Lou Barletta, a Pennsylvania Republican who is the prime sponsor of the bill, said on the House floor. \u201cUnfortunately, they are. Because they should have and in many cases could have been prevented.\u201d Only nine of the 50 U.S. states followed a federal law requiring them to track and help those newborns, Reuters reported. The news agency found that more than 130,000 newborns were diagnosed with drug withdrawal over the last decade, but most of them weren\u2019t reported to state child-protection authorities. In April, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asked all states to report by June 30 whether and how they are following the existing law, known as the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. States receive federal funding after giving assurance they are complying. Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the leading Democratic co-sponsor, emphasized that the new legislation would require help for not only the newborn but also for the mother and family. That provision is aimed at overcoming resistance to reporting cases of newborn addiction among doctors and other health-care workers, who sometimes fear that mothers may be punished if the cases come to official attention.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThis important step with this bill is to ensure that the whole family is healthy and successful and supported,\u201d Clark said. The measure, formally known the Improving Safe Care for the Prevention of Infant Abuse and Neglect Act,\u00a0passed 421-0. Children\u2019s advocates are seeking more federal funding to go with the commitment.\u00a0\u201cWe would view this as a good first step, but they need to make it real and put some money in it,\u201d said\u00a0John Sciamanna, vice president of public policy for the Child Welfare League of America. Among the other opioid-related bills adopted by the House on Wednesday was one designed to help states emulate a pilot program for drug-affected newborns in Huntington, West Virginia. Rep. Evan Jenkins, a Republican who helped create the Huntington facility, known as Lily\u2019s Place, before he became a congressman, said his bill would help improve access to care for poor babies and women on Medicare.

        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations reaffirmed on Friday that torture is illegal and that refugees deserve protection, while ducking any direct criticism of remarks made by new U.S. President Donald Trump. Major human rights groups have denounced Trump\u2019s stance on torture and warned against restoring a CIA secret detention program for interrogating terror suspects. Trump is also reviewing spending, including at the U.N., where the United States is the largest donor. \u201cInternational human rights law is clear on the absolute prohibition on torture,\u201d U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a news briefing. Pressed repeatedly to comment on Trump\u2019s remarks this week that torture \u201cworks\u201d, Colville noted that prominent U.S. Senators including Republican John McCain, himself a torture victim, and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who chaired an inquiry on the CIA program under former President George W. Bush, had spoken out. It was still very early days in terms of how the U.N. human rights office interacts with the new administration, he said.  \u201cWe have to work out strategically what is going to be effective.\u201d The UNHCR was also tepid in its comments on Trump\u2019s moves to restrict refugees. He is expected to sign an executive order that would include a temporary ban on all refugees, and a suspension of visas for citizens of Syria and six other Middle Eastern and African countries. \u201cOf course UNHCR believes that refugees should be offered assistance, protection, opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their race, religion or ethnicity,\u201d UNHCR spokeswoman Vannina Maestracci said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has temporarily halted trips by staff to interview refugees abroad ahead of a likely shakeup of refugee policy by Trump, two sources said on Thursday. During the election campaign, Trump decried former President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to increase the number of Syrian refugees admitted to the United States over fears that some fleeing the country\u2019s civil war might carry out attacks. Some 25,000 refugees were resettled in the United States between October and year-end under UNHCR\u2019s program for the most vulnerable, Maestracci said. A host of U.S. federal government agencies are involved and extensive background checks are carried out, she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that refugees coming into the United States to be resettled are some of the most vetted individuals entering the United States,\u201d Maestracci said.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will nominate Jon Huntsman, an envoy to China under former Democratic President Barack Obama, as U.S. ambassador to Russia, the White House said on Tuesday. The job, all the more high-profile because of allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate. If confirmed, Huntsman, who has long been expected to be Trump\u2019s pick for the job, will head to Moscow as the U.S. Congress and a special counsel investigate Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election and allegations that Trump\u2019s campaign had ties to Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied the interference, and Trump has said there was no collusion with Moscow. Huntsman, a former Utah governor, was U.S. ambassador to China from 2009 to 2011. He has served in the administrations of five U.S. presidents and was a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. Trump has said he wants to improve relations with Russia. The Republican president met with Putin in Germany at the gathering of G20 leaders there earlier this month and officials said he raised the issue of Russian meddling in the election before moving on to other issues such as the war in Syria. Reports in March that Huntsman would get the Moscow envoy post were greeted with mixed reviews in Moscow, with one politician saying he was \u201cnot a dove\u201d and the Kremlin saying it would welcome anyone who was a \u201cconvinced proponent\u201d of establishing a dialogue with Russia.

If an appeals court fails to overturn the conviction on Jan. 24, he will be barred from running for elections scheduled for October 2018. Even after the conviction, Lula remains beloved by much of Brazil s working class for bringing millions out of poverty through generous social welfare programs.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump intends to nominate former Senate Republican aide Hester Maria Peirce to be a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the White House said on Tuesday. Peirce is a former Senate Banking Committee staff member and currently is the director of the Financial Markets Working Group at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. She was nominated to the SEC last year by President Barack Obama, but the full Senate never acted on her nomination. Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee attempted to block her nomination when she declined to fully commit to work as a commissioner on requiring corporations to publicly disclose their political donations. She ultimately won the committee\u2019s blessing but her nomination stalled in the Senate as Republicans dragged their feet on approving names put forward by Obama, a Democrat. Peirce could face a rocky time again in the chamber. Liberal firebrand Senator Elizabeth Warren is highly critical of Peirce, who is a member of the Federalist Society, an organization of conservative and libertarian lawyers. Peirce could be instrumental in carrying out Trump\u2019s plan to reform regulations imposed after the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession. She recently edited and contributed to a book published by the right-leaning Mercatus Center that called for totally restructuring the country\u2019s financial regulation. Peirce would fill one of two vacancies on the five-member commission. If Trump follows tradition, he will suggest a Democrat for the other open slot at the top U.S. securities regulator. Columbia University law professor Robert Jackson is a leading contender to fill the Democratic slot, people familiar with the matter said last month. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate could vote as early as Monday on confirming President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, with the political parties potentially entering a standoff requiring Vice President Mike Pence to act as tie-breaker. On Friday morning, the Senate voted 52 to 48 on a procedural measure paving the way to the final confirmation vote, which the education committee chairman, Senator Lamar Alexander, said will happen early in the week. DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist and charter-schools advocate, has faced unusually fierce opposition for a role that rarely receives congressional debate or public notice.  After her confirmation hearing, where DeVos seemed ill-equipped to discuss public education issues and suggested allowing guns at schools to fend off bear attacks, voters flooded Capitol Hill with calls and emails to block her nomination. Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have said they will not vote for her, the first Republicans to break party ranks and vote against one of Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees. If one more Republican sides with Democrats against her nomination, DeVos will become only the 10th cabinet nominee in U.S. history rejected by Congress.  Voting margins are so thin that Pence, as head of the Senate, may have to cast a tie-breaking vote. The Senate\u2019s top Democrat, Charles Schumer, pressed Republicans to consider voting against her over the weekend. \u201cThe nominee for the secretary of education is one of the worst nominees that has ever been brought before this body for a cabinet position,\u201d he said on the Senate floor. \u201cSometimes loyalty to a new president demands a bit too much.\u201d Alexander, a former education secretary, is confident that DeVos will ultimately be approved.

Republicans see DeVos as a champion of low-income children and local control of education. \u201cI would argue that she has been among the forefront of the leaders...for the most successful reform of the last 30 years to change and improve public education, and that would be the public charter schools,\u201d he said. Democrats worry DeVos\u2019 support for charters, which operate  independently of school districts and are frequently run by corporations, means she wants to undermine public schools.  They also have expressed dismay about her refusal to pledge to uphold rules on sexual assault, for-profit colleges and fair access to disabled students, as well as potential conflicts of interest with her investments.

        "text": "MONROVIA (Reuters) - A presidential election run-off in Liberia scheduled for Tuesday will be delayed by a Supreme Court fraud investigation, the National Elections Commission (NEC) said on Friday. Former soccer star George Weah and Vice President Joseph Boakai are competing to succeed President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate whose election in 2005 helped draw a line under 14 years of civil war. The vote is meant to mark Liberia s first democratic transition of power since 1944, but the Supreme Court this week halted preparations while it examined charges by third-place finisher Charles Brumskine s Liberty Party that the Oct. 10 first round was marred by fraud. Following arguments by the Liberty Party and counter-arguments by the NEC, Chief Justice Francis Korkpor said that the court would give its decision at 10 a.m. (1000 GMT) on Monday, one day before the scheduled poll.   The election will definitely be delayed, but we don t know for how long,  NEC spokesman Henry Flomo said.  The fact that the court will not rule until Monday is a delay.  Boakai s ruling Unity Party has backed the Liberty Party s allegations and even accused Johnson Sirleaf, one of its own members, of interfering in the vote by holding private meetings with election magistrates.  Johnson Sirleaf denied the meetings were inappropriate. Observers from the European Union and the Carter Center said they saw no major problems with the first round vote. Addressing the court s five justices, Brumskine cited  gross irregularities . In its complaint last week, the Liberty Party alleged various problems, including the late opening of polls, the absence of queue controllers and fraud by NEC officials.   This is not about losing or winning,  Brumskine told the court.  It has do to do with putting a system in place.  Lawyers for the NEC replied that the petitioners did not have any evidence and asked that the court lift its stay so that the commission could organize the second round.  The streets of the capital Monrovia remained calm with riot police deployed to protect the Supreme Court building and the election commission headquarters. Weah, who became the first non-European to win the European soccer player of the year award in 1995, won the first round of voting with 38.4 percent to Boakai s 28.8 percent. Brumskine won nearly 10 percent.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price promised on Thursday to repay the nearly $52,000 cost of his seats on private charter flights, as expensive air travel by Trump administration officials drew sharp scrutiny from Congress. \u201cToday, I will write a personal check to the U.S. Treasury for the expenses of my travel on private charter planes,\u201d said Price, a former member of Congress, in a statement. \u201cThe taxpayers won\u2019t pay a dime for my seat on those planes.\u201d Price was one of a handful of senior officials in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration put on the defensive over reports about their use of charter flights and government aircraft, sometimes for personal travel, when they could have flown commercial for less money.  Price told Fox News on Thursday that Trump had spoken to him about the matter and was not happy. Asked if he retained Trump\u2019s confidence, Price said he worked at the president\u2019s pleasure. Washington media outlet Politico reported that Price had taken at least two dozen private charter flights since May at a cost to U.S. taxpayers of more than $400,000. Politico in a report on Thursday night said the White House had approved the use of military aircraft for other trips by Price to Africa, Europe and Asia in the spring and summer that cost taxpayers more than $500,000. \u201cSecretary Price will write a personal check to the U.S. Treasury for $51,887.31,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said on Thursday. Price is paying his individual share of the charter flight cost, an HHS official said. Price said earlier on Thursday he believed he retained Trump\u2019s confidence. Senior U.S. government officials travel frequently, but are generally expected to keep the costs down by taking commercial flights or the train when possible. Price, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin were all in the spotlight for their travel habits. Politico reported late on Thursday that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke took a charter flight from Las Vegas to Glacier Park International Airport in Montana in June that cost $12,375. The route is served by commercial flights. Zinke also took charter flights between St. Croix and St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands in March and used a military aircraft to travel to Norway in May, according to Politico. \u201cAs with previous interior secretaries, the Secretary traveled on charter flights when there were no commercial options available,\u201d Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift said in a statement. \u201cAll travel is pre-approved by the ethics office before booking and the charter flights went through an additional level of due diligence.\u201d  Republican Senator Chuck Grassley urged Trump in a statement \u201cto emphasize to cabinet secretaries the necessity of using reasonable and cost-effective modes of travel in accordance with federal restrictions.\u201d In his statement, Price said his travel had been approved by legal and departmental officials. But he expressed regret over the concerns raised and pledged to take no more private charter flights while health secretary. \u201cI was not sensitive enough to my concern for the taxpayer,\u201d said Price, an orthopedic surgeon. He was confirmed in February as health secretary despite questions about how he had been buying shares in publicly traded healthcare companies while working on legislation affecting them. As a conservative Republican U.S. representative in 2009, Price chastised \u201cthe fiscal irresponsibility\u201d of private-plane use by government officials in an appearance on CNBC television that he also posted on Twitter. Price\u2019s travels and those of the entire Trump Cabinet are being probed by a U.S. House of Representatives committee.  Senate Democrats wrote to Price on Thursday demanding information about his flights.         The inspectors general at HHS, EPA and Treasury are investigating to see if government travel rules were followed. The EPA\u2019s inspector general said last month it was investigating Pruitt\u2019s frequent travels to his home state of Oklahoma. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Pruitt had taken at least four noncommercial and military flights since mid-February, costing taxpayers more than $58,000. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said Pruitt did use one charter flight but that other commissioned flights were done on government planes. \u201cThe administrator flies commercial, unless there is a necessity to do otherwise, and with approvals from EPA\u2019s ethics office,\u201d said EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox. At the Treasury Department, the inspector general is reviewing Mnuchin\u2019s use of a government plane to fly to Kentucky in August for a visit to Louisville and Fort Knox. Mnuchin and his wife viewed the solar eclipse during the trip. On the \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d program on Thursday, Mnuchin said he would use military planes in the future only when there are national security issues or \u201cthere\u2019s no other means\u201d of travel.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has gathered enough evidence to charge six members of the Russian government in the hacking of Democratic National Committee computers before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the investigation. Federal agents and prosecutors in Washington, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and San Francisco have been cooperating on the DNC investigation and prosecutors could bring the case to court next year, it said. By identifying individual Russian military and intelligence hackers with charges, U.S. authorities could make it difficult for them to travel, but arrests and jailing would be unlikely, according to the Journal report. The hacking investigation, conducted by cybersecurity experts, predates the appointment in May of federal special counsel Robert Mueller to oversee the probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion with President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. Mueller and the Justice Department agreed to allow the technical cyber investigation to continue under the original team of agents and prosecutors, the Journal said. U.S. intelligence agencies have said Russian intelligence agencies were behind those cyber attacks, which resulted in thousands of emails and other documents being made public by WikiLeaks last year. The intelligence community concluded in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the campaign to sway the election in Trump\u2019s favor. Russia has denied it meddled in the election and Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with the Russian government. If the case is brought by federal prosecutors, it would pinpoint the specific Russian military and intelligence hackers behind the attack on the DNC and the emails of John Podesta, who was campaign chairman for Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. It would be the second time the United States charged Russians with cyber crimes. In March, the Justice Department  charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers with masterminding the 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts.

        "text": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Retired South African cleric and anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu urged Myanmar leader and fellow Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on Thursday to intervene to help Rohingya Muslims fleeing her country. Western critics have accused Suu Kyi of not speaking out for the Rohingya, who have been fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh, following an army counter-offensive against militant attacks. Tutu said in an open letter to Suu Kyi that:  I am now elderly, decrepit and formally retired, but breaking my vow to remain silent on public affairs out of profound sadness about the plight of the Muslim minority in your country, the Rohingya.   My dear sister: If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep ... We pray for you to speak out for justice, human rights and the unity of your people. We pray for you to intervene,  Tutu wrote. Tutu, 85, has been living with prostate cancer for nearly two decades and has largely withdrawn from public life. The Rohingya comprise some 1.1 million people who have long complained of persecution and are seen by many in Buddhist-majority Myanmar as illegal migrants from Bangladesh.  We have to take care of our citizens, we have to take care of everybody who is in our country, whether or not they are our citizens,  Suu Kyi said earlier on Thursday in comments to Reuters Television s Indian partner, Asian News International. Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 as a champion of democracy, did not refer specifically to the exodus of the minority Rohingya. ",

        "title": "Israel interprets U.S. settlements statement as green light",
        "text": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli officials welcomed on Friday what they took as U.S. consent to expand existing settlements, after the White House reversed a long-standing policy of condemning building on occupied land. In its first substantive announcement on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Trump administration said it did not see existing settlements hampering peace with the Palestinians, although it recognized that \u201cexpansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal.\u201d At one level, that appeared to be an attempt to rein in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has announced wide-ranging settlement expansion plans since the Jan. 20 inauguration, including around 6,000 new homes. But on closer reading, the statement was a softening of policy from the Obama administration and even that of George W. Bush, because it does not view settlements as an obstacle to peace or rule out their expansion within existing blocs. \u201cNetanyahu will be happy,\u201d a senior Israeli diplomat said in a text message. \u201cPretty much carte blanche to build as much as we want in existing settlements as long as we don\u2019t enlarge their physical acreage. No problem there.\u201d Israel\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Tzipi Hotovely from the right-wing of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, interpreted it in a similar way, saying construction in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want for their own state together with Gaza, would go on unhindered. \u201cIt is also the opinion of the White House that settlements are not an obstacle to peace and, indeed, they have never been an obstacle to peace,\u201d she said. \u201cTherefore, the conclusion is that more building is not the problem.\u201d Israel seized the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The 50th anniversary of the occupation, which Israel marks as a reunification of Jerusalem, is in June.  There was no immediate comment from the Palestinians. Since taking office, President Trump has largely kept quiet on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, making no comment in response to Netanyahu\u2019s announcements for thousands more settler homes, a silence interpreted as endorsement. During the campaign, Trump said he would not interfere or push Israel to negotiate on a two-state solution to the conflict. He has nominated David Friedman as ambassador to Israel, a religious Jew who has raised money for the settlements and supports moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Trump supported that idea during the election campaign, but it has been put on the back-burner in recent weeks. Under Barack Obama, the White House maintained a firm anti-settlements line, calling them illegitimate and an obstacle to peace. Most of the world considers settlements illegal under international law, a position Israel rejects. The European Union and Britain issued statements this week criticizing Netanyahu\u2019s settlement plans, which they see as further breaking up the West Bank and undermining the possibility of a contiguous Palestinian state ever emerging. Netanyahu, who will visit Trump in Washington on Feb. 15, may see the White House statement as doubly beneficial. As well as not ruling out building within existing blocs, which Israel hopes to retain in any final agreement with the Palestinians, it may allow him to silence far-right voices in his own coalition calling for much greater settlement growth and annexation of parts of the West Bank.  Trump has effectively set a limit on how far-ranging settlement-building can be, so Netanyahu will be able to tell the far-right their ambitions are out of the question. At the same time, Netanyahu may have to curtail some of the plans he himself has announced in recent days. While most of the 6,000 settler homes he has promised are in existing blocs, many are not and may have to be scrapped if he wants to adhere to the White House line. He may also have to rethink a pledge this week to build the first new West Bank settlement since the 1990s. ",

        "title": "On shrinking U.S. corporate tax base, presidential candidates differ sharply",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The corporate income tax is a major revenue source for the U.S. government, but it has been shrinking for decades and the three main presidential candidates could not differ more dramatically on what to do about it. Republican Donald Trump and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have starkly contrasting plans, some more detailed than others, for taxing corporations. The tax paid by companies on their profits accounted for 30 percent of the U.S. federal tax base in the 1950s; last year, it was only 11 percent, Internal Revenue Service data show.  The decline, experts say, has many causes: loopholes that cut corporations\u2019 taxes; a lower corporate tax rate; rising overseas profits that are lightly taxed; and a shift away from incorporation toward partnerships and other business structures that pay no corporate tax. Despite the dwindling corporate tax base, Trump, the Republicans\u2019 presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 election, wants to ease the burden on companies by slashing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. In this regard, he shares the same view as most Republicans. Trump, a real estate developer, has described his proposals as revenue neutral, saying reduced tax rates would be paid for by eliminating some tax breaks and repatriating corporate cash held overseas. However, the Tax Policy Center, a centrist tax research group in Washington, said that under Trump\u2019s plan, corporate income tax revenues would fall $1.9 trillion from 2016 to 2026. A cut on that scale would hugely expand the federal budget deficit, unless severe budget cuts or alternative tax hikes were also made, the center said. Steven Rosenthal, a Tax Policy Center senior fellow, said Trump\u2019s plan is a standard business-focused approach, but \u201cthe drafting is incomplete, so we can\u2019t tell exactly what he\u2019s thinking.\u201d   A Trump campaign spokeswoman pointed to the proposals on the campaign website but declined to comment further. Republicans generally support corporate income tax cuts because, they say that would help corporations compete globally. In addition, some question the validity of the tax, which they say is passed on to consumers and investors. \u201cTaxing businesses is the Democrats\u2019 version of manna from heaven: someone else supposedly is paying for the government. But all citizens are hurt through lower growth, higher prices, lower wages,\u201d said Grover Norquist, a Republican tax activist. \u201cTaxes should be transparent. It should be clear who is paying them. The corporate income tax is designed to hide the tax burden,\u201d said Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a small-government group that opposes tax increases. Democrats tend to view the corporate income tax as a fair levy on businesses that benefit from the security, services and infrastructure provided by government. Corporations have been taxed by Washington since 1909. Clinton, a former secretary of state and the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has not promised a corporate tax cut. Like Trump, she has called for closing loopholes that corporations use to avoid taxes. But unlike Trump, her plan would raise corporate tax revenues by $136 billion over 10 years, the Tax Policy Center said. Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said the candidate\u2019s proposals \u201cgo further to prevent the erosion of the corporate tax base by ensuring corporations pay their fair share.\u201d But the Clinton campaign has yet to release its full plan. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont challenging Clinton for the Democratic nomination, would make more drastic changes and boost the corporate tax take by $1 trillion in the same decade, mostly by raising taxes on overseas profits, according to the Tax Policy Center. \u201cVirtually all of the revenue raised by Senator Sanders\u2019 corporate tax plan would come from large, multinational corporations that have shifted their profits offshore to avoid taxes,\u201d said Sanders policy adviser Warren Gunnels.  The question of whether businesses pay their fair share of taxes strikes a chord with Americans on the campaign trail. An April Gallup poll found 67 percent of U.S. adults said corporations do not pay enough tax.    Since the mid-1950s, income tax receipts from individuals  have held steady at 40-50 percent of federal revenues, while payroll taxes, deducted from the paychecks of wage-earners, have soared to 34 percent last year from 5-10 percent in the 1950s. Meanwhile, Congress has steadily reduced the corporate tax rate, now 35 percent. That is down from 46 percent in 1986, and 52 percent in 1956. Over that period, corporations have also carved out various loopholes that let them avoid paying the full rate.  The corporate tax applies only to incorporated businesses, while other business structures have been gaining in popularity. In 2003, the share of U.S. business income generated by incorporated companies fell below the share made by partnerships and other kinds of companies that pay no corporate tax.  Whatever candidates may say on the campaign trail, no changes can occur without agreement by Congress. And despite years of talk about the importance of tax reform, neither President Barack Obama nor lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been able to agree on a reform agenda that many say is needed to boost the economy and bring sanity to a tax code of Byzantine complexity.

China is already Cambodia s biggest donor and its support has bolstered Hun Sen in the face of criticism of what his opponents say amounts to the destruction of democracy. The aide, Sry Thamrong, said Hun Sen would attend a special summit from Thursday to Sunday held by the ruling Communist Party on a theme espoused by Chinese President Xi Jinping on turning the world for the better and without interference.

Gina Haspel, who will serve under new Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo, was the first woman spy to reach the CIA\u2019s second-highest position, and her selection won applause inside the agency\u2019s Virginia headquarters and from many longtime U.S. intelligence professionals.

Her promotion, combined with the possibility Trump could seek to reopen black site prisons and has endorsed waterboarding, may be controversial, despite the fact Pompeo and defense secretary James Mattis have rejected so called \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques.\u201d A draft executive order requesting a review of whether the U.S. should reopen CIA prisons in other countries and revisit other interrogation methods not considered torture has been circulating within the White House, but it is not clear if it will be issued, and if it is, whether any nations would agree to host such facilities again, the officials said. \u201cI appreciate Ms. Haspel\u2019s many years of service at the CIA, yet I want some reassurance from her that she intends to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law, like Director Pompeo testified that he would during his confirmation process,\u201d said Democrat Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee. Christopher Anders, the deputy director of the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union, said he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about Haspel\u2019s appointment. Haspel has served in a number of overseas posts, including as chief of a major CIA station, and although she was briefly acting head of the National Clandestine Service in 2013, Senator Dianne Feinstein, ranking minority member of the intelligence committee, opposed her permanent promotion to that job. Other veteran officials, though, praised Pompeo for choosing her. \u201cIt speaks well of him for picking a seasoned veteran of the agency who is widely and deeply respected by the workforce as well as those outside the agency,\u201d said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who resigned on January 20 after 50 years of military and intelligence service.

        "title": "Protests planned for Trump speech at pro-Israel conference",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some rabbis and Jewish students are planning protests against Donald Trump\u2019s speech on Monday at a conference of the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC over what they say are his belittling comments about Muslims and other groups. About 18,000 people are expected to attend the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2019s three-day annual conference in Washington. It is not clear how many will either boycott or walk out of the Republican presidential front-runner\u2019s address.  \u201cHe has taken every opportunity to vilify women, Muslims, Mexicans, immigrants and the disabled,\u201d said Jeffrey Salkin, a rabbi in Hollywood, Florida, who asked rabbis across the country to join him in a boycott. He said 40 had agreed and signed a protest letter he hoped to distribute at the conference. Another group of rabbis and students called Come Together Against Hate is planning to walk out of the room after Trump takes the stage. Jesse Olitzky, one of its organizers, said he did not know how many people would participate. The group\u2019s Facebook page had 300 members. Some of the students received an email earlier this week from AIPAC warning that if they disrupted the speech, they would have their conference access revoked. An AIPAC official said on Thursday the message \u201cwent out in error and was not authorized.\u201d \u201cI know nothing about that,\u201d Trump said in a Reuters interview on Thursday when asked if he had heard about the planned protests and whether he intended to respond. When he announced his candidacy last summer, Trump said some people crossing the U.S. border from Mexico were criminals and rapists, and promised to build a wall along the border. In December, he called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, on national security grounds. Last week, he told CNN: \u201cIslam hates us.\u201d The Anti-Defamation League and an organization of Reform rabbis condemned his comments.  AIPAC, which is non-partisan, routinely hosts presidential hopefuls at its conference. Trump\u2019s remaining Republican rivals, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich, will address the group as well.  \u201cThe job of AIPAC is not to decide whose policies we like or look into the souls of people,\u201d said Seth Siegel, an AIPAC veteran who said he was not speaking on behalf of the organization. \u201cIt\u2019s the organization\u2019s job to try to educate elected officials about how to deepen the U.S.-Israel relationship for the benefit of both parties,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving Trump speak at the policy conference is unambiguously part of that mission.\u201d ",

        "title": "A house divided: How Saudi Crown Prince purged royal family rivals",
        "text": "BEIRUT/RIYADH (Reuters) - The first hint that something was amiss came in a letter. On Saturday Nov. 4, guests at Riyadh s Ritz Carlton were notified by the opulent hotel that:  Due to unforeseen booking by local authorities which requires an elevated level of security, we are unable to accommodate guests ... until normal operations are restored.  The purge was already under way. Within hours security forces had rounded up dozens of members of Saudi Arabia s political and business elite, mostly in the capital and the coastal city of Jeddah. Among them were 11 princes as well as ministers and wealthy tycoons. Some were invited to meetings where they were detained. Others were arrested at their homes and flown to Riyadh or driven to the Ritz Carlton, which has been turned into a temporary prison. The detainees were allowed a single, brief phone call home, a person familiar with the arrests told Reuters.  They don t receive calls and are kept under tight security. No one can go in or out,  the insider said.  It is obvious that there was a lot of preparation for it.  The purge was ordered by 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Officially next in line to the throne to his father, King Salman, he is now in effect running the country which he has said he will transform into a modern state. To do that - and in an attempt to shore up his own power - he has decided to go after the Saudi elite, including some members of the royal family, on accusations such as taking bribes and inflating the cost of business projects. Those arrested could not be reached for comment. At stake is political stability in the world s largest oil producer. The Crown Prince s ability to rule unchallenged depends on whether the purge is successful. The Crown Prince believes that unless the country changes, the economy will sink into a crisis that could fan unrest. That could threaten the royal family and weaken the country in its regional rivalry with Iran. (See this graphic on the Saudi family and the royal arrests: tmsnrt.rs/2AjCNiQ) Prince Mohammed decided to move on his family, the person familiar with events said, when he realized more relatives opposed him becoming king than he had thought.  The signal was that anyone wavering in their support should watch out,  said the person familiar with the events.  The whole idea of the anti-corruption campaign was targeted towards the family. The rest is window dressing.  King Salman said the purge was in response to  exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money . Insiders said the accusations were based on evidence gathered by the intelligence service. Government backers have rejected suggestions that the campaign is really about eliminating political enemies. There was no immediate comment from the royal court on this story. Among those now holed up at the Ritz Carlton hotel is Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who is head of the powerful National Guard and Prince Mohammed s cousin. Miteb was in his farm house in Riyadh when he was called to a meeting with the Crown Prince. Such an invitation, even at night, would not be unusual for a senior official and would not have aroused suspicion.   He went to the meeting and never came back,  said a second insider who has connections to some of those who were detained. Others held include Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who is chairman of international investment firm Kingdom Holding and a cousin of Prince Mohammed, and Prince Turki bin Abdullah, former governor of Riyadh province and a son of the late King Abdullah. Some royal watchers said tensions were laid bare during family meetings over the summer. One insider said it was widely known to Prince Mohammed that some of the powerful royals, including Miteb, were resentful about his elevation.  Prince Mohammed, who is widely known in Saudi Arabia by his initials MbS, had said openly in interviews that he would investigate the kingdom s endemic corruption and would not hesitate to go after top officials.  The vehicle was an anti-corruption committee created by King Salman, and announced on Nov. 4. The king put the Crown Prince in charge, adding another power to the many he has been given in the past three years.  Saudi authorities have questioned 208 people in the anti-corruption investigation and estimate at least $100 billion has been stolen through graft, the attorney-general said on Thursday. The head of the committee said investigators had been collecting evidence for three years.   By launching a war on corruption, the prince has combined a popular cause with the elimination of an obstacle to acceding to the throne.  MbS used the corruption stick which can reach any one of them,  said Jamal Khashoggi, a former adviser to Prince Turki al-Faisal, intelligence chief from 1979 to 2001.  For the first time we Saudis see princes being tried for their corruption.  But Khashoggi, who lives in the United States, said Prince Mohammed was being selective in his purge.  I believe MbS is a nationalist who loves his country and wants it to be the strongest but his problem is that he wants to rule alone,  he said. (See this graphic on Saudi Prince Alwaleed s investments: tmsnrt.rs/2j5fE04) Prince Mohammed was appointed defense minister in 2015 when King Salman became monarch. In June, the King named him heir to the throne, pushing aside his older cousin Mohammed bin Nayef, a veteran head of the security apparatus. The royal family acquiesced and by September the Crown Prince had rounded up and jailed religious and intellectual opponents. The latest detentions are intended to help him push through reforms that promise the greatest change since the reign of King Abdulaziz, founder of the current Saudi state in the 1930s. That state has rested on an enduring accommodation between the royal family and the Wahhabist clerics who control the hardline version of Islam that originated in Saudi Arabia. The ruling family promised to give Saudis comfortable lives and a share of the country s oil wealth. In return, their subjects have offered political submission and promised to follow the country s strict religious and social codes. King Abdulaziz, who was also known as Ibn Saud, died in 1953. Since then, Saudi Arabia has been run by the king and below him there has been a group of princes, none of them strong enough to impose his will against the wishes of the others. Decisions have mostly come through consensus. That arrangement has meant social and political change has been glacial although it has also kept the kingdom stable. But in moves that position Prince Mohammed as the new Ibn Saud, the Crown Prince is tearing down pillars of rule that had been eroding under the weight of population growth and low oil prices. Consensus has been replaced by what critics say is one-man rule, opposed by some princes although they would not risk saying so in public. In the past few decades, every Saudi king had one or two of his brothers, sons or nephews by his side advising and sharing in governance. But Prince Mohammed has not appointed any of his brothers or other close family to top positions, instead relying on a team of advisers   mainly Saudis though some are U.S.- or British-trained. King Salman, 82, still has the last word on everything. But he has delegated the running of the kingdom s military, security, economic, foreign and social affairs to Prince Mohammed. There has been speculation for months, denied by court officials, that the king will soon abdicate the throne to MbS. Even the Crown Prince s age is remarkable. The last three kings have reached the throne aged 61, 80 and 79. Prince Mohammed is effectively in charge at 32. Prince Mohammed says he offers a new social contract: A state that functions better than the rigid bureaucracy of the past, opportunities to have fun and an economy that will create jobs that can last, whatever happens in oil markets. In September he announced that Saudi women will be given the right to drive. Just three weeks ago, during a conference for investors at the same Ritz Carlton that now houses the targets of his purge, he unveiled a plan for a $500-billion futuristic city where sexes could mingle and robots outnumber humans. The prince has also drawn up a blueprint to wean Saudi Arabia off its dependence on oil and its subjects off state subsidies and government jobs. The public listing of national  oil company Saudi Aramco, planned next year, is its centerpiece. There are no guarantees the prince s ambitions will succeed. Even some admirers ask whether his reach exceeds his grasp. His top-down approach, brooking no opposition, could scare off investors wanting assurances about rule of law and security. Without huge investor support, he will struggle to meet the aspirations of Saudi youth. War in Yemen, a dispute with the Gulf emirate of Qatar and growing tension with Iran is a concern to investors too. It should help that Prince Mohammed, following the example of Ibn Saud, sees the importance of forging a special bond with the United States. During a visit to Saudi Arabia in May, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Riyadh to lead an alliance against Iran and its attempt to cut a Shi ite axis through Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Soon afterwards, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates blockaded Qatar, accusing its ruling Al Thani dynasty of supporting Iran and Islamist terrorism. Trump gave his backing. After the arrests of the past week, Trump tweeted support, saying those arrested had been  milking their country for years . One insider close to the royal family said the National Guard was unlikely to react strongly to Miteb s removal. He said  there had been no resistance to the ousting of Mohammed bin Nayef at the interior ministry and the National Guard would be no different. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate unanimously backed President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Eric Fanning as secretary of the Army on Tuesday, making him the first openly gay leader of a U.S. military service branch. Fanning was previously undersecretary of the Air Force and chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter. Fanning was confirmed by unanimous voice vote, eight months following his nomination, after Senator Pat Roberts said Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work told him that it was now too late for the administration to transfer prisoners from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Roberts\u2019 home state, Kansas. Work did not confirm Roberts\u2019 account of that conversation, saying that no option was off the table. \u201cI explained to Senator Roberts that we are trying to achieve the goal of closure with the support of Congress and we recognize that there is limited time left to achieve that support, both in terms of lifting Congressional restrictions and winning approval of funds to execute closure,\u201d Work said in a statement.  Roberts had held up Fanning\u2019s nomination for months to  underscore his opposition to any possible transfer of detainees. His opposition had frustrated fellow Republican John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a strong supporter of Fanning\u2019s nomination. On Tuesday, McCain and Roberts appeared in the Senate together as Roberts announced that he had released his \u201chold\u201d on Fanning and spoken to Fanning. McCain noted that this year\u2019s National Defense Authorization Act ensures that the Obama administration does not have the authority to release or transfer Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. mainland. Roberts said Work told him during a meeting last week that he would be unable to fulfill an order to move Guantanamo detainees to the United States before Obama leaves office in January 2017. \u201cThe clock has run out for the president,\u201d Roberts said.

        "title": "Effort to replace Trump on ballot would face tremendous obstacles",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some prominent Republicans are urging Donald Trump to quit as the party\u2019s presidential nominee after video surfaced of him making vulgar comments about women but any attempt to replace Trump on the ballot would face huge legal and logistical hurdles. The real estate magnate has insisted he would never give up the White House race and wrote on Twitter on Sunday that Republicans who are attacking him are \u201cself-righteous hypocrites.\u201d     With only a month to go before the Nov. 8 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton, it would be a massive stretch to substitute Trump for his running mate Mike Pence or anyone else, Republican strategists and U.S. election experts said.     It is \u201cvirtually impossible to replace somebody in August, let alone October,\u201d Republican strategist Karl Rove said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d  After a video of Trump making vulgar comments about women surfaced Friday, Republicans such as U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois urged Trump to remove himself from the race. The 2005 video showed Trump, then a reality TV star speaking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania.  Making a change at the top of the ticket for one of the two major parties this close to Election Day would be without precedent in the history of modern U.S. presidential elections. In 1972, Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern\u2019s running mate, Thomas Eagleton, was replaced after it was revealed that the vice presidential hopeful had been hospitalized for depression. Eagleton withdrew from the race in August of that year and was replaced by Sargent Shriver. In 2000, Missouri voters faced a last-minute candidate change in the state\u2019s U.S. Senate race after the Democratic challenger Mel Carnahan died in a plane crash, a month before the election. Carnahan\u2019s name remained on the ballot, however, and the dead man won the election. His widow, Jean Carnahan was appointed to fill the seat.   Republican party rules do not include a mechanism to involuntarily remove from the ticket a presidential candidate who has already been nominated.  The party does have procedure, known as Rule 9, that outlines the process for filling a vacancy if a nominee were to die or quit. Republican leaders could try to pressure Trump into resigning by withdrawing financial support for his campaign and withholding logistical help. But as of Sunday, Trump showed no sign of backing down and went on the attack against party figures who have suggested he leave the race. But if Trump were to decide to quit, the process would involve convening a 160-member committee of the Republican convention to select a new nominee, said Thomas Schwartz, a presidential historian at Vanderbilt University. Experts say such a step would lead to electoral chaos with Republican attorneys fighting state-by-state legal battles to make the last-minute candidate swaps on paper ballots, long after many state deadlines have already passed. Even more daunting, would be how to deal with early or overseas votes already cast. About 411,000 Americans already have voted in person or through the mail, according to Michael P. McDonald, a Florida State University political science professor who tracks early voting. The figure is sure to grow dramatically over the coming days. Early voting has already begun in six states and this week it will start in eight more. Another problem for Republicans is the risk of legal challenges to the election result. Concern about such challenges could deter some Republicans from voting. The Republican Party might argue that those ballots already cast for Trump should count toward electoral votes for the replacement candidate, said Matthew Dallek, an expert on presidential politics at George Washington University\u2019s Graduate School of Political Management. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile said the party would likely challenge any effort by Republicans to replace Trump as their candidate on the ballot, adding that it would be \u201cvery confusing\u201d for voters with early ballots already being cast. \u201cIt would be political suicide for Donald Trump to step down right now,\u201d she told ABC News. \u201cI\u2019m sure my legal team is already looking at efforts underway, if there are any efforts underway,\u201d she said when asked if Democrats would oppose any effort by Republicans in the states to switch candidates on ballots. Dallek said an effort to substitute a new candidate at this point would lead to \u201cutter chaos.\u201d \u201cWe would be operating in uncharted territory. You would be in this legal netherworld,\u201d he said. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has selected Joseph Simons, an antitrust attorney from a Washington law firm, to head the Federal Trade Commission, a White House official said on Wednesday. Trump is expected to nominate Simons to the agency, along with Noah Phillips and Rohit Chopra to be FTC commissioners, the White House official said. Upon confirmation, Simons will be designated chairman, the official said. The agency is currently headed by Acting Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, with Democrat Terrell McSweeny the only other commissioner. The president has long been expected to name a permanent chair and fill the three empty commission seats, two Republican and one Democrat or independent. Simons, a partner at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, was a director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition from 2001 to 2003. During Simons\u2019 tenure at the FTC, the agency sued to stop Diageo PLC and Pernod Ricard from buying Seagram Spirits and Wine in 2001 to prevent a duopoly in rum. The FTC also filed a lawsuit in 2003 to stop Haagen-Dazs owner Nestle Holdings Inc from buying Dreyer\u2019s Grand Ice Cream Inc, which makes also superpremium ice cream. The FTC later settled both cases. Noah Phillips, who graduated from Stanford Law School in 2005, is chief counsel for U.S. Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican. He is also a veteran of the law firms Steptoe & Johnson LLP and Cravath, Swaine & Moore.  To fill the empty Democratic seat on the commission, the president tapped Rohit Chopra, a financial services expert. Chopra, an ally of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, is currently at the Consumer Federation of America. The FTC works with the Justice Department to enforce antitrust law and pursues companies accused of deceptive advertising. It is an independent agency that is headed by a chairman and four commissioners. No more than three commissioners can come from any one party. ",

        "text": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia s lawmakers have rejected legislation that would tighten citizenship and foreign worker visa rules, a blow to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull who had sought to stop a loss of his support base to far-right political parties. In April, Turnbull said Australia would abolish a temporary work visa popular with foreigners and replace it with a new program requiring better English-language and job skills. Turnbull also announced plans to raise the bar for citizenship by lengthening the waiting period and adding a new  Australian values  test. But Australia s senate, where Turnbull s center-right government does not enjoy a majority, rejected the proposal in a late vote on Wednesday, with opposition lawmakers insisting the rules were counter to Australian multicultural values. The senate rejection may further drag on support for Turnbull, which, according to the widely watched Newspoll poll on Monday, languishes at its lowest level in more than two years. The next election is not due until 2019, but continued poor polling could undermine Turnbull s leadership. Mathias Cormann, Australia s special minister of state, said on Wednesday the government will seek to move the legislation through the senate again as soon as they have secured the necessary support.  We will keep working with all non-government senators to secure the necessary support,  Cormann told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.

        "title": "U.S. infrastructure legislation back on Congress' radar",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to bring massive investments in U.S. infrastructure projects showed new signs of life on Friday after lying dormant for weeks, as leading Republican lawmakers said proposals from the administration could be in the offing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, told reporters he expects to receive \u201csome kind of recommendation on an infrastructure bill, a subject that we frequently handle on a bipartisan basis,\u201d but gave no details or timing. He has previously voiced concern over adding to budget deficits with a new injection of federal funds for road, bridge and other construction projects like the ones President Barack Obama secured from Congress in 2009, especially after a major highway funding law was enacted about a year ago. Some Republicans and Democrats in Congress are increasingly criticizing Trump\u2019s administration for being slow to get behind his legislative initiatives during the first month of his presidency. Trump\u2019s plans to create an infrastructure council led by two New York billionaire friends, developers Richard LeFrak and Steven Roth, have yet to be launched, a spokesman for LeFrak said.  During his presidential campaign, Trump said he would push for a $1 trillion infrastructure program to rebuild roads, bridges, airports and other public works projects. He said he wanted action during the first 100 days of his administration, which now seems unlikely. The Republican president has talked about creating a tax credit to encourage private sector investment in many of these projects. But Democrats say that would fail to spur enough rebuilding and put taxpayers on the hook for a tax credit to wealthy developers, who they said would build toll roads that taxpayers would then have to pay to use. Democrats want a more direct federal role in sparking a construction boom. In an interview on Tuesday, Republican Representative Mario Diaz-Balart said he had \u201cno doubt that it (infrastructure investment) is a priority for the administration.\u201d Diaz-Balart chairs a House subcommittee that would control the flow of Washington money that might be needed to fund some of the public works projects. Several lawmakers and aides speculated the initiative could be attached to tax reform legislation that Republicans want to advance this year, but no decisions have been made. Writing an infrastructure bill involves seven or eight committees, there are complicated tax and spending questions at stake, and lawmakers are divided. There are also questions over what would qualify as an infrastructure project, with rural areas, for example, clamoring for more broadband internet service. Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership who chairs the commerce and transportation panel which has a say on any bill, said he had little information on the content or status of legislation. Asked about McConnell\u2019s comments, Thune said, \u201cMaybe he knows more about it since he\u2019s married to the secretary of transportation,\u201d Elaine Chao. ",

        "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is considering refitting the Izumo helicopter carrier so that it can land U.S. Marines F-35B stealth fighters, government sources said on Tuesday, as Tokyo faces China s maritime expansion and North Korea s missile and nuclear development. Japan has not had fully fledged aircraft carriers since its World War Two defeat in 1945.  Any refit of the Izumo would be aimed at preparing for a scenario in which runways in Japan had been destroyed by missile attacks, and at bolstering defense around Japan s southwestern islands, where China s maritime activity has increased. Three government sources close to the matter said the Japanese government was keeping in sight the possible future procurement of F-35B fighter jets, which can take off and land vertically, as it looks into the remodeling of the Izumo. The 248-metre (814-feet) Izumo, Japan s largest warship equipped with a flat flight deck, was designed with an eye to hosting F-35B fighters. Its elevator connecting the deck with the hangar can carry the aircraft, the sources said.  Possible refitting measures included adding a curved ramp at the end of the flight deck, improving the deck s heat resistance against jet burners, and reinforcing the ship s air traffic control capability, they said. However, Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said the government was not taking any concrete steps towards refitting the Izumo.  Regarding our defense posture, we are constantly conducting various examinations. But no concrete examination is under way on the introduction of F-35B or remodeling of Izumo-class destroyers,  Onodera told reporters on Tuesday. The Izumo has a sister ship called the Kaga. Japan has frequently conducted joint drills with U.S. aircraft carriers in recent months to boost deterrence against North Korea.  One of the three government sources called such exercises  a great opportunity to see with our own eyes how the U.S. military operates their aircraft carriers  as Japan looks into the possible conversion of the Izumo into an aircraft carrier. Regional tension has soared since North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test in September. Pyongyang said a month later it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach all of the U.S. mainland. Japan is also wary of China s long-range missiles, and would like to secure measures to launch fighters from aircraft carriers in case runways operated by U.S. forces in Japan or by Japan s Air Self-Defence Force were destroyed by missiles. Article 9 of Japan s pacifist constitution, if taken literally, bans the maintenance of armed forces. However, Japanese governments have interpreted it to allow a military exclusively for self-defense. Owning an aircraft carrier could raise a question of constitutionality, the sources said, so the government is set to address the issue in its new National Defence Programme Guidelines to be compiled by the end of 2018.

        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia respects the desire of Iraqi Kurdistan to assert its identity but this must be done in dialogue with the Iraqi government, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday at talks with his Iraqi government counterpart. Relations between Iraqi Kurdistan and the central government in Baghdad have been in crisis since the region held an independence referendum last month. The Iraqi military took back the oil-rich Kirkuk area from Kurdish forces last week.  We understand the hopes of the Kurdish people as it concerns their striving to strengthen their identity, their self-awareness,  Lavrov said at a news conference with Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari.  However, we believe it is correct to realize those desires, those hopes exclusively via the Iraqi government and taking fully into account the significance the Kurdish question has on a regional scale, and taking into account the need to avoid additional sources of instability in the region.  Lavrov was meeting Jaafari days after Russian state oil major Rosneft agreed to take control of Iraqi Kurdistan s main oil pipeline. Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Saturday he had sought clarification from Rosneft. Lavrov said Russia would continue its economic ties with Iraqi Kurdistan, as it does with other constituent parts of Iraq. He said Russia was not closing its consulate in Erbil, the main city in Iraqi Kurdistan, but said the mission was subordinate to the Russian embassy in Baghdad.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An influential conservative bloc of Republican lawmakers on Thursday said it opposed renewal of an internet surveillance law unless major changes were made in how the U.S. government collects and uses American data, reflecting disagreement within the majority party. A week ago, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and 14 Republican U.S. senators said they wanted the spying authority to be renewed without any changes before it expires at the end of the year. Amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act adopted by Congress in 2008, including a controversial part known as Section 702, broadened the U.S. government\u2019s legal authority to conduct surveillance of phone calls, emails and other communications belonging to foreigners who live overseas. U.S. intelligence agencies and U.S. allies consider the law vital to national security, but privacy advocates have criticized Section 702 for allowing the incidental collection of data belonging to an unknown number of Americans without a search warrant. \u201cGovernment surveillance activities under the FISA Amendments Act have violated Americans\u2019 constitutionally protected rights,\u201d the group of about three dozen lawmakers, known as the House Freedom Caucus, said in a statement. \u201cWe oppose any reauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act that does not include substantial reforms to the government\u2019s collection and use of Americans\u2019 data.\u201d The caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives has already had success in challenging the Trump White House and the Republican congressional leadership on other policy issues. It opposed legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system on grounds that it did not do enough to repeal former President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law, earning concessions on a bill that passed the House in May. The intraparty dissent among Republicans in Congress over Section 702 resembles a debate that took place two years ago, when lawmakers disagreed sharply over whether to curtail a National Security Agency program that collected U.S. call metadata in bulk - a practice exposed publicly by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden. The dispute led to the brief expiration of the USA Patriot Act before lawmakers passed a law effectively terminating the bulk collection practice. The extent of Section 702 spying was also revealed in disclosures by Snowden, prompting outrage internationally and embarrassing some U.S. technology firms. On Wednesday, a declassified court document, made public in response to lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation, revealed that an unidentified U.S. technology company objected in 2014 to participating in a Section 702 program, but was ordered by a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to comply.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee said on Friday that it has scheduled a new hearing on Kaspersky Lab software as lawmakers review accusations that the Kremlin could use its products to conduct espionage. Kaspersky Lab has strongly denied those allegations, which last month prompted the Trump administration to order civilian government agencies to purge the software from its networks, and agreed to send Chief Executive Eugene Kaspersky to Washington to testify before Congress.  The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology announced the Oct. 25 hearing a day after reports that Russian government-backed hackers stole highly classified U.S. cyber secrets in 2015 from a National Security Agency contractor who had Kaspersky software installed on his laptop. The House science committee did not say who would be called to testify at the hearing.  Eugene Kaspersky last month told Reuters that the committee had invited him to testify at a Sept. 27 hearing and that he would attend if he could get an expedited visa to enter the United States.  That hearing was later canceled, though the committee held a closed-door classified session on Kaspersky software on Sept. 26. Eugene Kaspersky said in a statement on Friday that he hoped to attend the hearing. \u201cI look forward to participating in the hearing once it\u2019s rescheduled and having the opportunity to address the committee\u2019s concerns directly,\u201d he said.  An appearance before Congress would mark Kaspersky\u2019s most high-profile attempt to dispel long-standing accusations that his firm may be conducting espionage on behalf of the Russian government. The investigation into the 2015 NSA hack is focused on somebody who worked at the agency\u2019s Tailored Access Operations unit, a unit that uses computer hacking to gather intelligence, according to two people familiar with the classified probe. Kaspersky anti-virus software was running on the contractor\u2019s laptop at the time of the hack, and investigators are looking into whether hackers used the software to breach the computer and steal the data, said one of those sources.

        "title": "Senate joins House to pass sweeping new health bill",
        "text": "(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to support sweeping legislation that will reshape the way the Food and Drug Administration approves new medicines.  It will also provide funding for cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s research, help fight the opioid epidemic, expand access to mental health treatment and advance research into precision medicine.  Two years in the making, the 21st Century Cures Act was passed last week by the House of Representatives and will now go to President Barack Obama to sign into law. Supporters say it will speed access to new drugs and devices, in part by allowing clinical trials to be designed with fewer patients and cheaper, easier-to-achieve goals. \u201cFor the second consecutive year, the Senate is sending the President another Christmas miracle for his signature,\u201d Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee said in a statement. \u201cLast year, it was the Every Student Succeeds Act, and this time, it\u2019s the 21st Century Cures Act \u2014 a bill that will help virtually every American family.\u201d  Critics of the legislation say it gives massive handouts to the pharmaceutical industry and will lower standards for drug and medical device approvals. \u201cThis gift \u2013 which 1,300 lobbyists, mostly from pharmaceutical companies, helped sell \u2013 comes at the expense of patient safety by undermining requirements for ensuring safe and effective medications and medical devices,\u201d consumer watchdog Public Citizen said in a statement. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren was among the handful of senators who voted against the bill, as was independent senator and former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Each decried what they described as big handouts to the pharma industry. Even so the bill passed 94-5. The House passed it by a vote of 392-26. The $6.3 billion act, sponsored by Republican Representative Fred Upton, authorizes $4.8 billion for the National Institutes of Health and $500 million to the Food and Drug Administration. It also calls for $1 billion over two years to battle the opioid epidemic. On Tuesday the Drug Enforcement Administration issued a report showing that in 2014 about 129 people died every day as a result of drug poisoning. Of those, 61 percent are opioid or heroin related. \u201cOpioids such as heroin and fentanyl - and diverted prescription pain pills - are killing people in this country at a horrifying rate,\u201d Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg said. \u201cWe face a public health crisis of historic proportions.\u201d The bill also calls for $1.8 billion in funding for Vice President Joseph Biden\u2019s Cancer Moonshot initiative designed to bolster cancer research by reducing bureaucracy and promoting research collaboration. Critics note that the money described in the bill must be appropriated by separate funding bills and that the money may ultimately never materialize. Yet the changes to the clinical trial process, something long sought by the drug industry, will be set in stone regardless of whether money for the research projects is forthcoming.  Among those changes: Greater prominence will be given to \u201creal world\u201d evidence gathered outside the framework of a randomized, controlled clinical trial, the gold standard for determining whether a drug is safe and effective. Such evidence could be much easier for drug companies to collect. \u201cThe passing of 21st Century Cures Act is a show of extraordinary bipartisan unity after a divisive election that should be celebrated,\u201d said Ellen Sigal, chair of the patient advocacy group Friends of Cancer Research. Under the Act patient input will be formally incorporated into the FDA\u2019s drug review process. Funding for the Act will be offset by reductions in some Medicaid payments and through the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The White House supports the bill but said earlier it was concerned that draining the Petroleum Reserve \u201ccontinues a bad precedent of selling off longer term energy security assets to satisfy near term budget scoring needs.\u201d ",

        "title": "France to lead investigation into A380 engine explosion",
        "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - France s air accident investigation agency said on Tuesday it would lead the probe into an engine explosion that prompted the emergency landing of an Air France A380 superjumbo in Canada with over 500 people on board on Saturday. Reuters reported on Monday that Canada, France and the United States were debating who should lead the investigation into the accident, which took place high over Greenland. The decision to hand control to the BEA means investigators can begin planning an unusual search in potentially inhospitable terrain to find a missing 3-metre-(9.8-foot)-wide fan that ripped off the engine in midair. Nobody was injured in the incident, in which Air France Flight 66, originating in Paris and bound for Los Angeles, declared a mayday and diverted to Goose Bay in Labrador. The BEA confirmed that the engine s main fan and inlet had become detached. It now plans with Danish help to search for the missing parts.  That s what is envisaged, but it depends on snow conditions,  a BEA spokesman said. A preliminary reading of the plane s data recorder in Canada has identified a search area. The BEA said damage was limited to the right-outer no.4 engine and its immediate surroundings, boosting chances that the aircraft can be flown back to Europe for further examination. The A380 is the world s largest airliner and a European icon with a history of attracting debate because of its high public profile, and the start of the probe appeared to be no exception. Under aviation law, the job of investigating belongs to Denmark since the blowout happened over Greenland, which is part of Denmark with self-government over domestic affairs. With three other major aviation nations involved, each equipped with sophisticated testing equipment, Denmark exercised its right to delegate the main role. But people briefed on the talks said it took days to agree who should take its place. Canada was seen as keen to keep control of the case, but aviation experts said France had priority because that was where the plane was built, designed, registered and operated. Canadian investigators will remain involved along with counterparts from the United States, France and Denmark, whose expertise is needed to track down the missing fan. They will be helped by Airbus and U.S. engine maker Engine Alliance, co-owned by General Electric and Pratt & Whitney. Experts say such engine accidents are rare but must be investigated thoroughly because of the significant damage they can cause. In 2010, a Qantas A380 made an emergency landing in Singapore after a Rolls-Royce engine exploded shortly after take-off. Investigators blamed a badly manufactured part. ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Democratic Party has selected a handful of undocumented immigrants for official roles at next week\u2019s Democratic National Convention, in a bid to highlight the gaping policy divide on immigration between White House hopeful Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump. Clinton is hoping to drive Latino voters to the polls on Nov. 8 to shore up her chances against Trump, who has campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration by building a wall along the Mexican border and deporting millions of undocumented foreigners if elected. \u201cOur nation is a nation of immigrants that believes in being inclusive, and that\u2019s exactly what we will continue to work toward,\u201d said\u00a0Leah Daughtry, the chief executive officer of the committee organizing the July 25-28 convention in Philadelphia. \u201cThe voices of our nation\u2019s brave undocumented youth will be heard loud and clear,\u201d Daughtry added. The picks include two members of the convention credentials and platform committees, as well as several speakers. The positions are unpaid, officials said. Trump\u2019s campaign, which has argued that unchecked immigration hurts American workers and undermines national security, criticized the move. \u201cApparently speaking at Hillary Clinton\u2019s convention is just one more job Hillary Clinton thinks Americans won\u2019t do,\u201d a Trump campaign aide said in an emailed statement. \u201cShe should have instead invited unemployed Americans, or victims of crime, or law enforcement.\u201d  The selections are legal because of a \u201cdeferred action program\u201d adopted by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, which postpones deportations and provides work authorization for some immigrants brought to the United States as children. The Supreme Court blocked efforts to expand those protections last month. The nominations mark the first time a major U.S. political party\u2019s convention has featured so many undocumented workers among its ranks. While there was an undocumented speaker at the 2012 Democratic convention, the party has not previously tracked the immigration status of its committee members. \u201cIt changes the whole conversation when you have someone directly affected at the table,\u201d said Cesar Vargas, a Mexican immigrant chosen for the party\u2019s policy platform committee.  Hareth Andrade, 23, an undocumented immigrant from Bolivia who was approved under a deferred action program, was picked for the credentials committee.\u00a0The convention will also feature at least two undocumented immigrant speakers, Astrid Silva and Francisca Ortiz. Clinton already has overwhelming support from minorities. Some 70 percent back her, compared with 9 percent for Trump, according to recent Reuters/Ipsos polling, suggesting that she could have a strong chance in states like Florida, Nevada and Colorado that swing between voting Democratic and Republican in presidential elections.  However, voter turnout among Latinos has traditionally been low, hitting only about 40 percent in 2012, meaning her challenge is to get more of them to cast ballots this year. Luis Fraga, co-director of the Institute for Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame, said showing a commitment to progressive reform of U.S. immigration policy could help Clinton do that.  He called immigration a gateway issue for minority voters that can help engage them. That\u2019s especially so because even Latinos born in the United States are often not far removed from family members who are immigrants themselves.  \u201cAlthough it\u2019s not their individual experience, it is their family\u2019s experience,\u201d Fraga said.

        "title": "Zimbabwe's ruling party must fix economy to win vote: president",
        "text": "HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s President Emmerson Mnangagwa told members of his ruling ZANU-PF party on Friday they would have to start fixing the economy if they wanted a chance of winning next year s vote. Mnangagwa spoke at a party congress that drew a line under the rule of ousted veteran leader Robert Mugabe by formally expelling his wife Grace and her allies from the organization and by endorsing Mnangagwa as party chief and candidate.  We will only win at the ballot box if we can show signs that we are reviving our economy and at the same time we will only be able to make economic gains if we can secure re-election,  he said. Zimbabwe s economy collapsed in the latter half of Mugabe s rule, especially after violent and chaotic seizures of thousands of white-owned commercial farms.     The southern African nation could hold elections as early as March, Mnangagwa said this week, which would be just five months after the de facto military coup which ended Mugabe s 37-year reign.  Democracy bids that as a political party, ZANU-PF must always compete for office through pitting itself against opposition parties in elections which must be credible, free, fair and transparent,  Mnangagwa, 75, told the congress in downtown Harare. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said late last month that financial support for the new government to stabilize its currency system and help it clear World Bank and African Development Bank arrears depended on  democratic progress . In a sign of the military further consolidating its political power, Mnangagwa made three generals members of the party s Russian-styled executive Politburo, the supreme decision-making organ of ZANU-PF. Major General Engelbert Rugeje was appointed political commissar, a job focused on revamping party structures and preparing for elections. Mnangagwa said he would name two deputies in a few days. Defence Forces Commander General Constantino Chiwenga is a strong contender for one of the vice presidency slots as a reward for spearheading the de facto coup that ended Mugabe s rule. Mnangagwa, whose sacking as vice-president set off the chain of events that led to Mugabe s removal, said the ZANU-PF congress should define a new trajectory - which he did not spell out - and put behind it the victimization of members seen in the past.

        "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The State Department said on Monday it was ending U.S. funding for the United Nations Population Fund, the international body\u2019s agency focused on family planning as well as maternal and child health in more than 150 countries. In a letter to U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, the State Department said it was dropping the funding because the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) \u201csupports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.\u201d The cut marks U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s first move to curtail funding for the United Nations and is likely to raise further questions about how deep those cuts will eventually go throughout the organization, where the United States is the top donor.    It comes after Trump in January reinstated the so-called Mexico City Policy that withholds U.S. funding for international organizations that perform abortions or provide information about abortion. Known by critics as the \u201cglobal gag\u201d rule, Trump broadened its scope to include all global health assistance in his Jan. 23 executive order that withholds at least half a billion dollars in U.S. funds. A lack of clarity around the rule, however, has left aid groups scrambling and both Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers seeking clarity. In a statement on its website, UNFPA said it regrets the U.S. decision to end funding, which it said is based on an \u201cerroneous claim\u201d that the agency supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in China. UNFPA said its mission is \u201cto ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person\u2019s potential is fulfilled.\u201d  \u201cThe support we received over the years from the government and people of the United States has saved tens of thousands of mothers from preventable deaths and disabilities, and especially now in the rapidly developing global humanitarian crises,\u201d the statement said. The cut follows Trump\u2019s proposed 28 percent budget reduction for diplomacy and foreign aid, including an unspecified reduction in financial support for the United Nations and its agencies, announced last month.        U.N. agencies such as the UNFPA are funded by governments voluntarily. The United States was the fourth-largest voluntary donor to UNFPA in 2015, giving $75 million in core budget and earmarked contributions.\u00a0 U.N. officials have warned that abrupt funding cuts could trigger more global instability and argued that dollars for diplomacy are more effective than military spending in combating terrorism.

        "title": "Big banks' relationship with Dodd-Frank: it's complicated",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Having spent billions of dollars on post-crisis U.S. financial industry reforms they once scorned, bankers are concerned the Trump administration, joined by a like-minded Congress, will scrap or significantly change the rules. To comply with a rule known as Dodd-Frank, which was enacted in 2010 following the financial crisis, big U.S banks hired tens of thousands of staffers, built new technology systems, hived off businesses, simplified corporate structures and doubled the amount of capital they hold. JPMorgan Chase & Co has said that in its mortgage business alone, employees spent 800,000 hours in compliance training in a single year. The industry went into these changes kicking and screaming. Banks lobbied hard against Dodd-Frank as it was being drafted, then cajoled regulators to go easy in defining and implementing precise rules. But now that the heavy lifting has been done and Dodd-Frank is largely in effect, the industry see a total  elimination as more of a threat than a blessing. Dodd-Frank has largely made banks safer and the once-opaque derivatives market more transparent, banking executives said.  President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, and some important lawmakers in the incoming Republican Congress have pledged to dismantle the law and put a new one in place. It is not yet clear what the replacement would look like, but Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, has drafted a blueprint called The CHOICE Act. The proposal has a mix of things the industry largely supports, such as abolishing the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), but it also has some ideas Wall Street vehemently opposes, like ramping up capital requirements to a level that would likely force big banks to split apart. Proposed changes are also likely to run into stiff opposition from some congressional Democrats, particularly Senator Elizabeth Warren, architect of the CFPB. Big U.S. banks including JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley have seen big gains in their share prices since the Nov. 8 election, partly on expectations that regulators will soon have a much lighter touch. \u201cThere is scope for lower taxes, less regulation, and more growth,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report on Tuesday recommending big bank stocks. However, bankers, lawyers and consultants who spoke to Reuters said any big rollback in rulemaking could take several years to implement and may introduce more costs. \u201cOne of the dangers of dismantling regulation is that it will be costly and disruptive,\u201d said Mike Alix, a consultant at PwC who works with banks on regulatory matters. \u201cBy and large they\u2019ve gotten themselves into shape and they\u2019re not looking to get out of shape.\u201d Industry sources said they are hoping it\u2019s possible to roll back some elements of Dodd-Frank that they view as too onerous or misguided, without scrapping the entire law. For instance, many would like to see the Volcker rule, which places restrictions on proprietary trading, go away. The rule was intended to prevent federally insured banks from placing speculative bets in the markets, and would be repealed as part of Hensarling\u2019s plan. Some banks are taking a second look at compliance initiatives until they gain further clarity on what will happen in Washington. At a conference this month, Bank of America Corp Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag said he is being \u201ca little more cautious\u201d about compliance spending. It is difficult to know whether it is worth spending another $30 million on Volcker rule compliance, he said, because doing so may be a waste of money but not doing so could leave the bank at risk if the rule is implemented as planned. \u201cEven if Volcker doesn\u2019t go away, there are still questions about how tough the enforcement would be,\u201d said Mark Nuccio, who leads the bank regulatory practice at law firm Ropes & Gray LLP. \u201cBanks are deciding they may take the foot off the gas pedal now and just see what happens.\u201d ",

        "title": "Debate over firing U.S. consumer watchdog director intensifies",
        "text": " (The Jan. 10 story corrects Sasse\u2019s state to Nebraska in the seventh paragraph) By Lisa Lambert WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The debate over whether President-elect Donald Trump should fire the head of a U.S. consumer watchdog after taking office came to a boil on Tuesday, with congressional lawmakers sending off strong letters that dug into constitutional law.  Republican senators pushing Trump to fire the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, portrayed the agency as overreaching its authority. Meanwhile, Democrats said firing Cordray would advance a \u201cWall Street agenda\u201d to escape federal oversight. The bureau, created in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, was originally proposed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, to guard individuals against lending fraud. At the heart of the debate is a restriction that the president can only fire the director for cause. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is reviewing a recent court decision that the president should be able to fire the director at will. Some want Trump to remove Cordray for cause soon after his inauguration on Jan. 20, and not wait for the appeals court\u2019s decision. That could open the door for Cordray to sue. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, started Tuesday\u2019s fight with the tweet: \u201cIt\u2019s time to fire King Richard.\u201d Sasse, a member of the Banking Committee, and fellow Republican Mike Lee, of Utah, then released a letter to Vice President-elect Mike Pence saying the CFPB \u201ccombines the powers of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches into the hands of a few unaccountable Washington elites.\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, the most senior Democrat on the Banking Committee, shot back with a statement that Cordray should stay until his term expires in 2018. \u201cUnder Richard Cordray\u2019s leadership, the CFPB has returned $12 billion to servicemembers, seniors, and working Americans who\u2019ve been ripped off by shady debt collectors, for-profit schools, payday lenders, and huge banks like Wells Fargo,\u201d Brown said. The CFPB recently was part of a $190 million settlement with  Wells Fargo, which was accused of creating phony accounts.   In the House, 21 Democrats sent a letter to Trump saying no U.S. president has ever removed an independent agency head for cause. \u201cWhile we understand that many powerful special interests would like to see Director\u00a0Cordray\u00a0leave, we urge you not to bow to their demands to initiate costly, meritless litigation, and we stand ready to oppose any efforts you may make to do so,\u201d they wrote.

        "title": "Co-leader of Germany's far-right AfD to quit in major blow",
        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Frauke Petry, co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany, said on Tuesday she was leaving the party in a major blow to its credibility just two days after it surged to third place in a national election. The anti-immigrant AfD won 12.6 percent of the vote in Germany s election on Sunday, becoming the third-largest group in parliament and the first from the far-right to win seats in the Bundestag since the 1950s.  Petry, the highest-profile figure in the AfD s more moderate wing, had shocked other senior members by saying on Monday she would not sit with the AfD in the Bundestag (lower house) but rather as an independent member of parliament. Her husband, another senior AfD figure, is also leaving the party.   We tried to change course but you have to realize when you reach a point when that is no longer possible,  Petry, a 42-year-old chemist, told reporters in the eastern city of Dresden.  I have five children for whom I am responsible and ultimately you have to be able to look yourself in the mirror.  Petry has clashed with other senior members, arguing for the party to take a more moderate course to make it possible for it to join a coalition government. Her husband, Marcus Pretzell - head of the AfD in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and also an MP in the European Parliament - is quitting the party and will become an independent MP, a spokesman for the AfD in NRW said. The spokesman said Pretzell and another AfD lawmaker in NRW s regional assembly who is also leaving the party had made the decision for reasons of  personal integrity . On Monday, four of the 17 AfD lawmakers in the assembly of the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern announced they were bolting because the party had become more radical. Europe s far-right parties have a history of infighting among their various factions. Marine Le Pen, leader of France s National Front, last week lost her deputy over policy differences.  Alexander Gauland and Alice Weidel, the AfD s top candidates during the election campaign, were elected as chairs of the party s parliamentary group on Tuesday. Gauland is a supporter of Bjoern Hoecke, a senior AfD member who has courted controversy by denying that Adolf Hitler was  absolutely evil  and calling Berlin s Holocaust Memorial a  monument of shame . Weidel was originally an opponent of Hoecke but has not been so critical of him lately. Weidel said she did not expect other lawmakers to quit the party but added:  We ll have to see. The step surprised us all, but there are not yet any trends recognizable in the future parliamentary group.  Senior AfD member Dirk Driesang, who in July founded a moderate group within the AfD called the  Alternative Centre , with which Petry was said to sympathize, told news magazine Der Spiegel that the group could not understand Petry s decision and would not be following in her footsteps. He said the group would continue to fight for the AfD to take a moderate course and added that  a spin-off from the AfD is a stillbirth . Driesang pointed to the example of Bernd Lucke, who founded the AfD then left in 2015 due to what he saw as rising xenophobia and then formed a new, unsuccessful party. Petry was the most recognizable face in the AfD during its swift rise over the past two years. But she said on Monday she could not stand with an  anarchistic party  that lacked a credible plan to govern. For months, Petry has urged the AfD to soften its stance and prepare to join coalition governments, while others wanted the party to stick to opposition. Mainstream parties refuse to work with the AfD. She had also distanced herself from some of the AfD s more radical senior members, saying their comments were putting voters off. Gauland caused a scandal during the election campaign by saying Germans should be proud of their World War Two soldiers. He also said the integration minister should be  disposed of  in Turkey, where her parents come from. As the AfD convened in Berlin on Tuesday for its first parliamentary group meeting, Gauland said discussions in the Bundestag would not echo those of the party s campaign.  It s clear that the talks during the campaign are different to those held in parliament,  he said.   ",

        "title": "U.S. Justice Department says anti-bias law does not protect gay workers",
        "text": " (In this July 27 story, corrects paragraph 7 to reflect that Zarda died in a BASE-jumping accident, not a skydiving accident) By Daniel Wiessner (Reuters) - The Trump administration told a U.S. appeals court that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees, a sharp reversal of the position former President Barack Obama took on a key civil rights issue. The U.S. Department of Justice, in a friend of the court brief, told the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Wednesday that Congress never intended Title VII, which bans sex discrimination in the workplace, to apply to gay workers.  The department also said the court owed no deference to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that enforces Title VII and has argued since 2012 that the law bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  The brief came hours after President Donald Trump said he would ban transgender people from serving in the military. That would reverse a 2016 policy adopted by Obama.  Justice Department spokesman Devin O\u2019Malley said the brief was consistent with rulings by 10 federal appeals courts and \u201creaffirms the Department\u2019s fundamental belief that the courts cannot expand the law beyond what Congress has provided.\u201d The department\u2019s brief was in support of New York skydiving company Altitude Express Inc in a lawsuit filed by a former employee, Donald Zarda.  Zarda claimed he lost his job as a skydiving instructor after he told a customer he was gay and she complained. He died in a BASE-jumping accident after filing the lawsuit. In April, a three-judge 2nd Circuit panel dismissed Zarda\u2019s case, citing a prior ruling that said discrimination against gay workers is not a form of sex discrimination under Title VII. The full court, which can overturn the prior decision, agreed in May to review the case. The issue could reach the U.S. Supreme Court in a different case brought by a former security guard at a Georgia hospital who claims she was harassed and forced to quit because she is gay.  Earlier this month, LGBT rights group Lambda Legal, which represents the former security guard, said it would ask the high court to review the case.  On Wednesday, the Justice Department said employers engage in sex discrimination only when they treat male and female workers differently. Objecting to homosexuality does not depend on sex, the department said, but on moral or religious beliefs. \u201cOf course, if an employer fired only gay men but not gay women (or vice versa), that would be prohibited by Title VII,\u201d the department wrote, \u201cbut precisely because it would be discrimination based on sex, not sexual orientation.\u201d Zarda\u2019s lawyer, Gregory Antollino, said on Thursday that the department was making the same arguments the Supreme Court rejected in cases involving discrimination against workers in interracial relationships.

        "title": "Some in Sanders' army seem determined to march on without him",
        "text": "PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - It should have been a triumphant night for Hillary Clinton when her rival Bernie Sanders gave a rousing speech urging his supporters to vote for her in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Instead it turned into a sign of potential trouble for her White House bid. His speech on Monday to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia urging the party to unite against Republican Donald Trump was met with some jeers when he endorsed Clinton \u2013 a sign he had lost control of his own movement. \u201cI\u2019m beyond disappointed,\u201d California delegate Aleece Depuey, 49, said after Sanders sought to rally support for his one-time rival.   Hundreds of Sanders supporters marched through the streets on Day One of the four-day convention, chanting: \u201cWe want Bernie!\u201d Delegates wore \u201cBernie or Bust\u201d buttons. Others donned Robin Hood-style hats, a call to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor.  When he spoke, a scuffle broke out between a Sanders supporter and a Clinton supporter in the hall.  The backlash raised questions over whether - and how - Clinton could ever win over Sanders supporters.  With opinion polls showing the Clinton-Trump race tightening, Clinton needs Sanders\u2019 voters more than ever. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, arrived in Philadelphia with 1,894 of 4,763 delegates after winning 13 million votes in the Democratic nominating contest. To many of Sanders\u2019 backers, Clinton is a bridge too far. They see her as the kind of political insider, backed by reams of corporate money, that drove them to Sanders and his fight to rein in Wall Street and remove income inequality. Others simply do not trust her, opinion polls show.  In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released at the end of June, some 15 percent of Sanders\u2019 backers said they would vote for Trump, and 19 percent would support neither Clinton nor Trump. Sanders won the states of Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, and New Hampshire in the run-up to the convention, and nearly won Iowa - all states that could be closely contested by Trump in the general election. Clinton likely will need some portion of Sanders\u2019 support to stay competitive in those states.  Clinton\u2019s campaign had hoped in Philadelphia to put the bare-knuckle primary fight behind it, but Sanders\u2019 voters were enraged by Friday\u2019s embarrassing release of internal party emails by the activist group WikiLeaks showing party officials clearly favored Clinton over their candidate.  Sanders supporters seemed to be everywhere, often with a bigger presence than Clinton supporters, a jarring sight at an event where she is due to be formally nominated as the party\u2019s presidential candidate.   At a delegate welcoming event on Sunday night, shouts of \u201cBernie!\u201d filled the air as his supporters circulated a petition to force convention organizers to hold an extended roll-call vote on the floor this week that would require each delegate to declare his or her support. Others pledged to contest Clinton\u2019s choice of Democrat Tim Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia, as her running mate.  When at mid-day Sanders addressed more than a thousand of his delegates at the city\u2019s convention center, the crowd erupted in fury when he asked them to switch their allegiance to Clinton. \u201cBrothers and sisters,\u201d he said over their jeers, \u201cthis is the real world that we live in. Trump is a bully and a demagogue.\u201d People started shouting back: \u201cSo is Hillary!\u201d Sanders did not mention Clinton again. But he already had lost the attention of some of his most fervent fans. \u201cAs soon as he said back Clinton, everyone stopped listening,\u201d said Cindy Melchert, a protester who listened to the appeal over a loudspeaker at a local park. A Michigan native, Melchert said she would not vote for Clinton in November under any circumstances. For her, the movement now was less about Sanders and more about showing the Democratic National Committee \u201cthey had us and absolutely lost us.\u201d Another protester, Michael Arnold of Atlanta, would not have been out of place at a Trump rally, sporting a T-shirt that read \u201cHillary for prison.\u201d  Fearing a similar scene on the convention floor would embarrass Clinton, Sanders\u2019 campaign emailed delegates before Monday night\u2019s program, urging them to restrain themselves. \u201cOur credibility as a movement will be damaged by booing, turning of backs, walking out or other similar displays,\u201d it read. Some Sanders supporters appeared willing to set aside their qualms about Clinton, largely out of a desire to see Trump defeated in the election. Diana Hatsis-Neuhoff, a delegate from Florida adorned with buttons backing Sanders, said she planned to vote for Clinton in the general election. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ll hold our nose and vote.\u201d Others felt their fellow Sanders supporters had taken the movement too far. \u201cWe are surrounded by people who are so selfish and so self-absorbed,\u201d said Melissa Robbins, who worked for the Sanders campaign in Philadelphia. \u201cNot voting for Hillary is a sure win for Donald Trump.\u201d But that may not be enough to sway Sue Spicer from Indiana, who said she had trouble imagining voting for either Clinton or Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to feel they have our best interests in mind,\u201d she said.

        "title": "Factbox: Republicans to watch in U.S. Senate tax bill fight",
        "text": "WASHINGTON - Some key U.S. senators still had concerns about the Republican tax bill in the Senate, as a procedural motion to formally open debate on the measure was approved on Wednesday.  Here is a list of Republicans pivotal to the bill\u2019s fate. The moderate senator from Maine has qualms about Republicans\u2019 plan to include in the tax bill a repeal of a federal fee imposed on people who do not comply with Obamacare\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d The fee is meant to encourage young, healthy people to get health insurance so that premiums are affordable for old, sick people. Collins and others fear repealing the fine would drive up insurance premium costs, canceling out tax-cut gains that many of their constituents might get from the tax bill. Collins said Republican leaders had promised her to take up two healthcare provisions before the end of the year to help mitigate the impact of repealing the fee. Those provisions would help insurers cover expensive patients and continue Obamacare subsidy payments for low-income people for two years. Collins has also prepared an amendment to the tax bill to make state and local property tax deductible up to $10,000, a provision that is part of the House of Representatives\u2019 tax bill. Both the Senate and House bills end deductibility of state and local tax income and sales tax. Unlike the House bill, the Senate bill ends property tax deductibility too. Collins sidestepped a question on whether she would vote for the tax bill. She said: \u201cWe\u2019re doing this one step at a time.\u201d The senator from Alaska will vote for the tax bill, she wrote on Twitter on Wednesday evening. Murkowski said a number of the bill\u2019s features were \u201cvery attractive,\u201d noting that it would lower tax rates, double the child tax credit and double the standard deduction. She said it also included a provision she had written, to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, to oil and gas drilling. Murkowski said it was important to enact reforms separately to help stabilize the individual market in health insurance. The Montana Republican has concerns about the bill\u2019s treatment of \u201cMain Street\u201d businesses. He said on Wednesday he had secured an agreement to increase a 17.4 percent deduction for owners of pass-through businesses to 20 percent. The senator from Wisconsin also has demanded more favorable treatment for \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses, which include sole proprietorships and partnerships, as a condition of his support. Corker, a deficit hawk from Tennessee, said on Tuesday he had the outlines of a deal adding a tax snap-back provision to the bill that would raise taxes automatically if economic growth targets are not hit in the future to offset a higher deficit. Corker said that arrangement would satisfy his concerns that the tax cuts could add too much to the national debt. As of Wednesday evening, the details had not been announced. The snap-back proposal also became a target of growing criticism among conservative Republicans and lobbyists. The tax bill was expected to add $1.4 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt over 10 years. The Arizona conservative said on Wednesday he was more comfortable with the tax bill because of indications there would be provisions in it to protect against ballooning the deficit. Flake told National Public Radio he was concerned about \u201cgimmicks,\u201d but liked other parts of the bill, especially the corporate tax cut. The Arizona maverick and former presidential nominee sidestepped questions on Monday about how he would vote on the tax bill, telling reporters in the hallway to \u201cstay tuned.\u201d Like Corker and Flake, Oklahoma\u2019s Lankford questions whether tax revenues from economic growth will compensate for the expected increase in the national debt under the tax plan. He has been working with them to \u201ctrigger\u201d more revenues if needed. The Kansas lawmaker is also wary of the impact on the national debt, pointing to his own state\u2019s recent experience of fiscal problems following tax cuts. ",

        "title": "Lawyers: Legal precedent clears Clinton in email investigation",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In declining to seek prosecution of Hillary Clinton, FBI Director James Comey said the former Secretary of State\u2019s handling of classified emails was \u201cextremely careless\u201d - conduct, legal experts said, that falls short of \u201cgross negligence,\u201d a standard for criminal charges under the Espionage Act. \u201cAlthough there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,\u201d Comey said in a news conference Tuesday detailing the FBI investigation and his decision. Several legal experts agreed with Comey\u2019s conclusion that there was no recent precedent for bringing such a case without evidence of willful intent or gross negligence, and they said it would have been difficult to convince a jury to convict Clinton based on the evidence. \u201cExtreme carelessness doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into gross negligence,\u201d said Laurie Levenson, a professor of law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and former federal prosecutor.  \u201cThe only times I have seen these statutes used has been situations in which people knew they were disclosing classified, confidential information, or they could show they didn\u2019t really care,\u201d Levenson said.  Comey said investigators determined that Clinton exchanged 110 emails that contained government secrets and that she and her staff should have known the information was classified. But unlike other cases prosecuted under the Espionage Act, the FBI has not suggested that Clinton\u00a0intentionally shared\u00a0government secrets with people not authorized to see them. The statute for charging gross negligence under the Espionage Act, written in 1917, requires the information be \u201cremoved from its proper place,\u201d a tough legal requirement in the digital age, said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at University of Texas. Vladeck said the law is not \u201cwell suited for careless discussion of information in unsecured media that doesn\u2019t dispossess the government of that information or direct it right into the hands of a foreign power.\u201d  Previous cases charged under the Espionage Act have shown intent, experts said. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell said Comey\u2019s decision was \u201ccompletely consistent\u201d with every case brought for leaking classified government information.  Defendants in other cases include Stephen Kim, Lowell\u2019s client who pleaded guilty to leaking State Department documents to the press, as well as former C.I.A. Director General David Petraeus. He admitted to keeping classified information, which he would also share with his biographer, in his home, while telling the government he had returned all such information. \u201cThe one common denominator of all such cases is that the individual involved intentionally sent material to those not authorized to receive it, like the press, like a foreign government,\u201d Lowell said. Comey said the FBI \u201cdid not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information.\u201d But he said it did find \u201cevidence that they were extremely careless in their handling a very sensitive, highly classified information.\u201d His recommendation, which Attorney General Loretta Lynch previously said she would accept, angered Republicans who said her actions should be punished.  Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump reacted to the news from his Twitter account, saying, \u201cThe system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less.\u201d In that case, the FBI recommended a felony charge. But Attorney General Eric Holder pursued a misdemeanor under another part of the law, and Petraeus pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to two years probation in 2015.  The FBI had recordings of Petraeus acknowledging the information in notebooks in his home was highly classified. Petraeus also admitted to lying to the FBI about sharing the information with Paula Broadwell, his biographer and lover. Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists\u2019 Project on Government Secrecy, said Clinton\u2019s cooperation with FBI investigators also may have helped her avoid charges. \u201cThere was no obstruction of justice, no failure to cooperate truthfully with investigators, no concealment of her activity,\u201d Aftergood said. Legal precedent suggests that Clinton is unlikely to face a misdemeanor charge for recklessness because recent cases that ended with misdemeanors began as much larger felony charges against individuals who intended to leak information. In 2010, Thomas Drake, a whistleblower from the NationalSecurity Agency who helped expose the government\u2019s warrantless surveillance of Americans, was charged with espionage after the government accused him of bringing five classified documents home. He denied the accusation, and those charges were dropped. Drake pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer. \u201cSomebody needs to ask Comey about my case,\u201d Drake, who now works at an Apple store in Maryland, wrote in an email late Tuesday. Former president Bill Clinton\u2019s national security adviser pleaded guilty in 2005 to smuggling classified documents out of the National Archives by stuffing them under his clothes. He was fined $50,000 and sentenced to two years of probation.  ",

        "title": "Trump taps net neutrality opponent Ajit Pai to head FCC",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday tapped Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai to head the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which is expected to roll back many of the Obama Administration\u2019s telecommunications and internet policies. Pai, a former Justice Department, FCC and Capitol Hill staffer, in December predicted landmark \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules adopted in 2015 would not last. The son of Indian immigrants who grew up in Kansas, Pai said the commission should take a \u201cweed whacker\u201d to unneeded rules and was harshly critical of many FCC regulations imposed during the Obama administration. \u201cDuring the Trump administration, we will shift from playing defense at the FCC to going on offense,\u201d he said in December. \u201cWe need to fire up the weed whacker and remove those rules that are holding back investment, innovation, and job creation.\u201d Pai will also have a key role in deciding whether to approve or reject or impose conditions on mergers involving cable and telephone companies. In May, Pai opposed FCC conditions imposed on Charter Communication\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner Cable. Last week, then FCC chairman Tom Wheeler urged Republicans against dismantling internet access protections that bar service providers from slowing consumer access to web content. Internet providers fear net neutrality rules make it harder to manage internet traffic and make investment in additional capacity less likely. The Republican-controlled Congress is also considering rewriting the net neutrality rules. Pai said in 2015 that consumers would be worse under net neutrality and should \u201cexpect their bills to go up, and they should expect that broadband will be slower going forward.\u201d Senator Maria Cantwell, a Washington state Democrat, criticized Pai in a letter to President Donald Trump Monday as \u201cnot a supporter of the FCC\u2019s strong rules to protect an open internet, putting at risk our robust net neutrality rules and the three million internet economy jobs it supports.\u201d Under Wheeler, the FCC and major telecom and cable companies have been at odds over a number of big issues in recent years, including tougher broadband privacy rules and a proposal to allow pay-TV consumers to ditch set top boxes. Comcast Corp, AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, Frontier Communications Corp, T-Mobile US Inc and Charter all praised Pai\u2019s appointment in separate statements. \u201cChairman Pai will work with his fellow commissioners to quickly and decisively put back in place the commonsense regulatory framework necessary to support the president\u2019s agenda,\u201d AT&T said. However, advocacy group Free Press President Craig Aaron said Pai \u201chas been on the wrong side of just about every major issue that has come before the FCC during his tenure. He\u2019s never met a mega-merger he didn\u2019t like or a public safeguard he didn\u2019t try to undermine.\u201d U.S. Telecom, an industry trade group, said in a statement it shares Pai\u2019s vision for a \u201cfuture based on a bold but pragmatic strategy to erase the many regulatory barriers impeding the expansion of our nation\u2019s communications infrastructure, and the jobs and economic opportunity that depend on it.\u201d Pai does not need Senate confirmation as chairman but his current term expires at year end and he will need to be reconfirmed to continue.

        "title": "Russia to amend law to classify U.S. media 'foreign agents'",
        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia s parliament warned on Friday some U.S. and other foreign media could be declared  foreign agents  and obliged to regularly declare full details of their funding, finances and staffing. Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the State Duma, said parliament could back legislation as early as next week in response to what lawmakers view as U.S. pressure on Russian media.  Possible restrictions will be the same as those taken by the United States,  Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.  He said some U.S. media in Russia were trying to turn U.S. public opinion against Moscow.   We understand that it s essential to protect the interests of our citizens and the country and we will do this in the same way as the country which lays claim to be the gold standard and mentor and which is constantly talking about freedom.  Russian lawmakers said the move was retaliation for a demand by the U.S. Department of Justice that Kremlin-backed TV station RT register in the United States as a  foreign agent , something Moscow has said it regards as an unfriendly act. The U.S. action against RT was taken after U.S. intelligence agencies accused Russia of trying to interfere in last year s U.S. presidential election to help President Donald Trump win the White House, something Moscow has denied.     Russia faces a presidential election next March. Vladimir Putin is widely expected to stand again and to win. He remains broadly popular though critics accuse him of suppressing dissent, not least by tight control of domestic media. Lawmakers will conduct a first reading of the new restrictions on Nov. 15 and try to complete approval in two further readings by the end of next week.  U.S. and any other foreign media that fall under the new restrictions could have to regularly disclose to Russian authorities full details of their funding, finances and staffing and might be obliged to say on their social media profiles and internet sites visible in Russia that they are  foreign agents . The Duma earlier this year launched an investigation into  whether CNN, Voice of America, Radio Liberty and  other American media  were complying with Russian law. U.S. government-sponsored Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) said last month Moscow had threatened to brand their Russian language service projects  foreign agents  in retaliation for U.S. pressure on RT. On Friday, Joanna Levison, RFE s director of media and public affairs, declined to speculate about how the latest move might affect the broadcaster, but said RFE had  every intention  of continuing its journalistic work in Russia.  ... While RT is able to work and distribute its content freely in the U.S., RFE/RL has lost all of its broadcast affiliates in Russia due to administrative pressure, it has no access to cable TV, and its reporters are beaten and harassed,  Levison said in an emailed comment. Russia said last month it had dropped accusations against CNN International of violating Russian media law and that the U.S. channel could continue broadcasting in Russia. San Francisco-based social network Twitter has also angered Russian authorities when it accused RT and the Sputnik news outlet of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election and banned them from buying ads on its network.

        "title": "Yazidis caught in 'political football' between Baghdad, Iraqi Kurds",
        "text": "SINJAR, Iraq (Reuters) - Since Iraqi forces pushed the Kurds out of the Yazidis   mountainous heartland of Sinjar in northern Iraq in October, residents are wondering what could happen to them next. Food and money are in short supply since aid organizations stopped delivery after Iraq s advance. Buildings collapsed in the fighting and of those still standing, many are marked with bullets and littered with IEDs. Water and electricity barely work. The Yazidis, whose beliefs combine elements of several ancient Middle Eastern religions, have long been viewed with suspicion and repeatedly persecuted by other groups in Iraq. In 2014, more than 3,000 were killed by Islamic State militants in a campaign described by the United Nations as genocidal. Now the land they have lived on for centuries is caught up in a tug of war between Baghdad and Iraq s Kurds, who had controlled it since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.  We re trapped in this game of political football, between Iraq and the Kurds,  said a Yazidi resident of Sinjar, Kamal Ali.  But neither of them cares about our future.  The militias have hoisted Iraq s tricolor flag over government buildings and any remaining Kurdish flags have been scrawled over with the words  Iraq  and  Allahu Akbar , the blazing sun at its center scribbled over in black marker. Sinjar is politically important because it s in the disputed territories, ethnically mixed areas across northern Iraq, long the subject of a constitutional dispute between Baghdad and the Kurds, who both claim them. Sinjar fell under the Kurds  control, despite lying outside Iraqi Kurdistan s recognized borders. Baghdad did little to challenge the arrangement until its October offensive, launched to punish the Kurds for their Sept. 25 independence referendum. Iraqi forces have seized the disputed areas the Kurds had expanded into including Sinjar. The referendum reignited long-simmering tensions over geographic dominance in the oil-rich north, between Baghdad and the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), who fought side by side to defeat Islamic State.  The Yazidis are divided about what should happen now. Some are glad the Kurds have gone and see an opportunity for increased autonomy now that they are under federal control following the offensive by Iraq s security forces last October. Kurdish forces handed over Sinjar without a fight to the Lalesh Brigades, a Yazidi militia backed by Baghdad s Shiite paramilitary forces (PMF). Most Yazidis speak a Kurdish dialect, but many don t see themselves as ethnically Kurdish.  We re happy the Kurds have left,  said Abu Sardar, a 47-year-old Yazidi man.  We re Yazidis we re not Kurds, we do not want to be part of Kurdistan.   Like others, Abu Sardar complained that the Kurds forced him to vote in the Kurdish referendum, accusations the KRG denies.  He returned two months ago to the ruins of his home in the Sinuni district of Sinjar and expressed bitter disappointment that little had changed since he left in 2014: hospitals and schools remain shuttered while the city is still mostly rubble.  He hopes that Baghdad and its militias will rebuild Sinjar. Others lament the Kurds  departure. The KRG and allied Yazidi groups hold former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki responsible for the campaign by Islamic State. They say his troops  desertion of Mosul allowed militants to capture billions of dollars in weapons later used to attack the minority.  Yazidi commander Qassem Shesho says Iraq s government is too sectarian and dislikes the Yazidis as much as Islamic State. Like many others, he blames the Kurds for the attack by Islamic State.  But they re all we ve got,  he said.     Shesho is allied to Iraqi Kurdistan s ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party, even though the Kurds cut his fighters  salaries after the Lalesh Brigades took over Sinjar. Some days, residents say, there are only bones in Sinjar. Nearly 50 mass graves have been uncovered outside the town since 2014.  Sinjar is a city of ghosts,  said the Lalesh Brigades  leader Ali Serhan Eissa, also known as Khal Ali. Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled the militant onslaught and headed for Mount Sinjar. Of those who didn t reach the mountain, about 3,100 were killed   with more than half shot, beheaded, burned alive and disposed of in mass graves. Others were sold into sexual slavery or forced to fight, according to a report by the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Medicine. Some are still on the mountain, about to spend a third freezing winter in tents.   Before the attack, Sinjar was home to about 400,000 people   mainly Yazidis and Arab Sunnis. Only 15 percent of Yazidis have returned home, according to humanitarian estimates.  Most Yazidis remain in IDP camps in the Kurdistan region, along with most of the area s displace Sunnis. Aid workers worry the camps will be closed if tensions between Baghdad and the Kurds flare up.  The presence of fighters from Turkey s separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) further complicates the picture. Many Yazidis credit them with opening up a land route to allow those stranded on Mount Sinjar to escape the militants in 2014. The PKK entrenched itself in the community, even creating a local unit, the Sinjar Resistance Units (YBS) which controls multiple checkpoints around Sinjar. Turkey and neighboring Iran are closely watching the power shift in Sinjar. Tehran wants to secure this north-western region of Iraq as it sits on the border with Syria, while Turkey wants the region free of the outlawed PKK. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - CIA Director Mike Pompeo on Thursday said, apparently inaccurately, that U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded that Russian interference did not affect the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In fact, U.S. intelligence agencies in January said that they had made no assessment one way or the other on the impact of Moscow\u2019s hacking and propaganda campaign but its report stated that Russia\u2019s aim was to try and help then-Republican candidate Donald Trump\u2019s election chances. Pompeo, a former Republican congressman and Trump ally, was asked at an event in Washington if he could say with absolute certainty that the election results were not skewed as a result of Russian interference. Pompeo replied: \u201cYes. Intelligence community\u2019s assessment is that the Russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome of the election.\u201d The top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, criticized Pompeo for his remark. \u201cI was deeply disappointed to learn that CIA Director Pompeo today asserted that the intelligence community had found that Russian interference in our election did not affect the outcome. In fact, the Intelligence community made no such finding, nor could it,\u201d Schiff said in a statement that noted the January assessment.  \u201cThis is not the first time the Director has made statements minimizing the significance of what the Russians did, but it needs to be the last,\u201d Schiff said.  The agency later issued a statement that appeared to walk back Pompeo\u2019s remark. \u201cThe intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed, and the Director did not intend to suggest that it had,\u201d said Dean Boyd, the director of the CIA\u2019s office of public affairs. Russia has repeatedly denied U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusions that Moscow meddled in the election and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russian officials. Committees in both the U.S. Senate and the House are investigating as is a special counsel, former FBI director Robert Mueller.

China will push ahead with market-oriented reforms of its foreign exchange rate as well as its financial system, and let the market play a decisive role in the allocation of resources, Xi said at the opening of a key, twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress.

The government will  promote strengthening, improvement and expansion of state capital, (and) effectively prevent loss of state assets, deepen reform of state-owned enterprises, development a mixed-ownership economy and cultivate globally competitive world-class firms,  Xi said.  Xi s comments reiterated a long-standing pledge by party leaders to give a greater role to free-market forces to improve efficiency and put the economy on a more sustainable growth path. But as Xi gears up for his second five-year term, foreign business executives and analysts increasingly believe market liberalization is seen as secondary to his state-centered approach to economic policy and his focus on stability. Other painful reforms that many economists say are needed have also moved slowly under Xi. They include overhauling China s bloated and debt-laden state sector, fixing the fiscal system to tackle local government debt and bringing in new property taxes to ward off housing bubbles. China should also strengthen consumption as a foundation for economic development, Xi said, and will expand the middle class and narrow the gap in development between rural and urban areas. Beijing s campaign to rein in high debt levels and industrial overcapacity will continue as part of supply-side structural reforms, he added.      Xi also proposed a goal of developing China into a  basically  modernized, innovation-driven country by 2035 and a modern  strong power  by 2050. But analysts said that suggests the government is likely to continue to target moderately high economic growth in coming years, which could see the country s large debt pile climb even further.  China s gross domestic income per capita would need to rise by an average of 6.6 percent a year in real U.S. dollar terms from 2017 onwards to become an  innovative economy  and match the development level of today s South Korea by 2035, ANZ estimated. That growth figure needs to be no lower than 4.9 percent for China to be a  modernized economy  - the by World Bank s definition of high income countries - all the way to 2050, ANZ added.  Nobody knows what is a  modernized country , but from the wording of Xi Jinping you can tell what he would like to achieve is for China to be one of the high income countries today like Japan and Australia,  said Raymond Yeung, Great China Chief Economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.  China is expected to post its strongest economic growth in several years this year, riding on a government-led construction boom, but economists said it is still relying too heavily on credit-fueled stimulus despite policymakers  vows to reduce debt risks. Some international agencies and economists have argued Beijing should abandon its arbitrary annual growth targets or lower it to become less reliant on government stimulus and bank credit. Less ambitious growth targets would also give policymakers more room for tougher reforms.  Specific economic targets for 2018 are likely to be set during an economic work meeting later this year, but are not expected to be announced until March.     The International Monetary Fund warned this year that China s credit growth was on a  dangerous trajectory  and called for  decisive action , while the Bank for International Settlements said in late 2016 that excessive debt growth was signaling a banking crisis in the next three years.

        "title": "Trump healthcare order could run afoul of retirement plan law",
        "text": "(Reuters) - President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to make it easier for small businesses to band together and buy stripped-down health insurance plans could violate a federal law governing employee benefit plans and will almost certainly be challenged in court, legal experts said. Trump signed an executive order on Thursday aimed at letting small businesses join nationwide associations for the purpose of buying large-group health plans that are not subject to coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. Industry experts said Trump\u2019s order could ultimately enable such associations to purchase insurance from states with the fewest regulations. That would undermine Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law, which Republicans have failed to repeal. Several healthcare and employment law experts said if Trump\u2019s plan moves forward, states could argue the federal government had overstepped its authority in violation of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a law that governs large-group plans. In Thursday\u2019s order, Trump asked the Department of Labor to propose rules that would allow more employers to participate in association health plans. Legal experts said lawsuits might not be brought until such regulations are issued. Dania Palanker, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, said ERISA granted states the right to regulate association health plans.  Attorneys general could argue the federal government had overreached if the Trump administration winds up allowing associations to buy health coverage across borders that only complies with a single state\u2019s regulations.  \u201cAny attempt to allow the sale of association plans to small groups across state lines will be open to legal scrutiny as to whether it is violating ERISA and undermining state authority,\u201d said Palanker. A White House official said that \u201cdepartments will be drafting rules in a way that minimizes litigation risk.\u201d The Department of Labor \u201cwill be reviewing ERISA in the course of following the President\u2019s direction\u201d in the order, the official said. A number of state attorneys general from Democratic-leaning states said on Thursday they would fight any efforts to weaken Obamacare, which extended health insurance to 20 million Americans, but which Republicans call intrusive and ineffective. \u201cIt should come as no surprise that California is prepared to fight in court to protect affordable healthcare for its people,\u201d said Xavier Becerra, the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general. Legal experts said states may argue the associations formed for the purpose of buying insurance are not employers under ERISA. Although ERISA allows associations to qualify as employers and manage large-group plans, federal regulators have generally required that members of such associations have a high degree of common interest beyond buying insurance, said Allison Hoffman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law. Trump\u2019s order asks the secretary of labor, who enforces ERISA, to consider expanding the common-interest requirements to permit broader participation in association health plans. SHORT-TERM PLANS The idea of expanding association health plans across state lines has long been championed by Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul, who made it a key plank of his own proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare. The Kentucky Republican was at Trump\u2019s side when the president signed the executive order. Paul\u2019s proposal said ERISA was too restrictive in its definition of associations and that the law needed to be amended.  Thursday\u2019s order also asked the Labor, Treasury and Health and Human Services Departments to look into expanding participation in cheaper, bare-bones, short-term limited-duration insurance plans, which are not subject to the ACA. Timothy Jost, a professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law, said such a move would face fewer legal hurdles than the expansion of association health plans. The current three-month limitation on the use of such plans was a rule adopted by the Obama administration last year, so the Trump administration could roll it back through the normal rulemaking process. Such plans are typically marketed to individuals who are between jobs or have a gap in coverage. They are much cheaper than ACA plans, but cover less and can exclude those with pre-existing conditions.  ",

        "title": "Trump tries to rally support for healthcare bill",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump tried to rally Republican lawmakers behind a plan to dismantle Obamacare on Tuesday as U.S. stock markets showed their worst one-day performance since the November election.  Trump is trying to win the first major legislative battle of his presidency. Pressure is growing on the businessman-turned politician to deliver as investors become worried that a failed healthcare push could also portend trouble for promised tax cuts and relaxed regulation that have propelled the market to record highs in recent months. In one of the few visits he has made to the U.S. Capitol since taking office two months ago, Trump told fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives on Tuesday morning they would face \u201cpolitical problems\u201d for opposing the bill that takes apart Obamacare and partially replaces it. Later in the day, Trump hosted roughly a dozen lawmakers in the Oval Office to listen to their concerns. \u201cThe president was really clear: He laid it on the line for everybody,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, the leading proponent of the bill, told reporters. \u201cWe made a promise. Now is our time to keep that promise. ... If we don\u2019t keep our promise, it will be very hard to manage this.\u201d The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average lost over 1 percent in their worst one-day performances since before Trump\u2019s election victory on Nov. 8. The S&P financial index sank 2.87 percent, its biggest daily fall since June. \u201cYou have this back and forth in Congress with the new healthcare plan and you have this belief that if the healthcare plan can\u2019t pass, then they can\u2019t move on to taxes. There\u2019s this feeling that if things don\u2019t get done, then maybe what the market has been anticipating gets held up,\u201d said Mark Kepner, managing director at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.  Some conservative lawmakers believe the healthcare bill does not go far enough, while moderate Republicans worry that millions of Americans will be hurt by the dismantling of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation. (For a graphic on how U.S. healthcare stacks up under the ACA and AHCA click tmsnrt.rs/2n0ZMKf)  Party leaders hope to move the bill to the House floor for debate as early as Thursday. But the administration and House leadership can afford to lose only about 20 Republican votes or risk the bill failing since Democrats are united against it. Republican Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said the roughly three dozen members have decided not to vote as a bloc. As many as 21 currently plan to vote no on the legislation, according to a CNN report. Republican Representative Walter Jones said Trump told lawmakers in the closed-door meeting at the Capitol that if the Republican bill does not pass, they would face \u201cpolitical problems.\u201d Jones said he thought Trump meant lawmakers could lose their seats. Repealing and replacing Obamacare was one of Trump\u2019s main campaign promises and has been a goal of Republicans since it was enacted.  While Trump predicted that Republicans could face challenges in primary contests ahead of the 2018 midterm elections if they do not gut Obamacare, there is also danger to them in doing so. If the Republican bill is passed, millions of voters might lose their healthcare coverage. The Congressional Budget Office said last week that 14 million people would forfeit coverage under the House bill over the next year, although that number could change based on the most current version of the legislation.  Nancy Nielsen, associate dean for health policy at the University at Buffalo\u2019s Jacobs School of Medicine, said Republican leaders were in a tough spot. \u201cIt is a not-so-delicate balancing act, as they have to win over the most conservative House and Senate members without causing an outrageous backlash from voters now or in the next election,\u201d Nielsen said.  Democrats oppose the Republicans\u2019 plan, saying it would hurt the elderly, poor and working families while giving tax cuts to the wealthy.     Republican leaders tweaked the bill this week to try to satisfy critics, mainly from their own party.  Republican chairmen for two key committees said late Monday they proposed more funding for tax credits, which conservatives have opposed, that would give the Senate flexibility to help older people afford health insurance. Additionally, Obamacare\u2019s taxes would be eliminated in 2017 instead of 2018. The amendments also addressed Medicaid, which is the country\u2019s largest health insurance program and covers about 70 million people, mostly the poor. The changes would allow states to implement work requirements for certain adults, an idea championed by many conservatives, and to decide how they receive federal funds.     Congressman Dan Donovan, who attended the Oval Office meeting on Tuesday, said Trump did \u201cmore listening than directing.\u201d There was some \u201cpolitical talk\u201d but \u201cno threats,\u201d he said. Donovan, who has not announced whether he will support the bill, cited people losing Medicaid and the defunding of women\u2019s healthcare provider Planned Parenthood as concerns in his New York district.  The Club for Growth, an influential conservative lobby group, said it would spend at least $500,000 for ads on television and digital platforms urging Congress members to defeat the bill. The Senate also will vote on the legislation, and more changes could be made. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that if the House approved a healthcare bill, he would try to bring it to the Senate floor next week. ",

        "title": "House chairmen seek new federal probe of Clinton testimony",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican chairmen of two U.S. House of Representatives committees asked the Justice Department on Monday to launch an investigation into whether Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton committed perjury during testimony to Congress about her use of a private email server. \u201cThe evidence collected by the FBI during its investigation of Secretary Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email system appears to directly contradict several aspects of her sworn testimony\u201d to Congress, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said in a letter to U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips requesting the probe. After a year-long investigation of Clinton\u2019s emails, the FBI recommended that no criminal charges be brought against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election. That recommendation was accepted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The FBI found, however, that she was \u201cextremely careless\u201d while secretary of state in her handling of email documents that contained classified information. Representative Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform panel, accused Republicans of a political vendetta following years of Republican-led investigations of Clinton in the House. \u201cRepublicans are now squandering even more taxpayer dollars in a desperate attempt to keep this issue alive and bring down Secretary Clinton\u2019s poll numbers ahead of the election,\u201d Cummings said. Clinton has said that she did not believe she was handling classified information on the private email system. Chaffetz has also asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation  to give him access to its investigative files on Clinton. ",

        "title": "Ireland set to vote on loosening abortion laws in May or June",
        "text": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland plans to hold a referendum next May or June on whether it should loosen some of the strictest abortion laws in the world, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Tuesday.  Abortion has long been a divisive issue in once stridently Catholic Ireland where, after a debate elicited large street protests from both sides, a complete ban was lifted in 2013. Terminations were allowed if a mother s life was in danger.  The ... proposal is to have a standalone referendum in May or June next year and will very much follow on from the recommendations of the all-party committee which is considering the matter,  Varadkar told parliament. A panel of citizens called together to advise government on the issue voted overwhelmingly that the eighth amendment of the constitution, which enshrines an equal right to life of the mother and her unborn child, should be changed. The all-party committee is considering those recommendations and is due to report to parliament by the end of the year on the referendum and potential shape of future legislation. Opinion polls show a large majority of voters want some change. Ireland became the first country to adopt gay marriage by popular vote in 2015 and campaigners seeking a repeal of the eighth amendment want that social change extended to abortion, citing the thousands of Irish women who travel abroad, mostly to England, for terminations each year. Anti-abortion supporters demand no further changes to the law. The human rights arms of the United Nations and Council of Europe have pressed the government to, at a very minimum, decriminalize abortion and widen the law to allow for abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, rape or incest. The referendum on abortion will be among seven the government plans to call within the next two years, it said on Tuesday, including a vote to remove the crime of blasphemy from the constitution. ",

        "title": "Incensed over refugees, east Germans punish easterner Merkel",
        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - For weeks, Chancellor Angela Merkel endured taunts and whistles whenever she ventured out on the campaign trail in her home region of eastern Germany. And on Sunday, it was voters in the east, incensed by her decision to allow hundreds of thousands of refugees into the country, that helped send her conservatives to their worst result since 1949 and vaulted a far-right party into the German parliament. Preliminary results showed the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) winning 22.9 percent of the vote in the former communist east, well above their national result of roughly 13 percent. The AfD performed especially well with east German men, 26 percent of whom backed the party. Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) scored 27.6 percent   well below their national result of nearly 33 percent   in the five states that became part of a reunified Germany in 1990. Merkel did secure a fourth term on Sunday, but she limped to the finish line and must now cobble together an unwieldy coalition with two other parties   the business friendly Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens   that have diametrically opposed views on many of the big issues. The result suggested that pollsters may have underestimated the lingering impact of the refugee crisis in the election and the outsized influence it would have in the east, where voters continue to behave very differently than their brethren in the west 28 years after the fall of the Wall. Earlier this month, a top aide to Merkel described the east German hecklers as a small minority and suggested the refugee crisis was no longer a negative factor for Merkel. The results on Sunday suggested otherwise.  East German voters are more extreme and less loyal to the traditional parties. This is how it has been ever since the Wall fell,  said Hendrik Traeger, a political scientist in Leipzig. Appearing on German television on Sunday night, Merkel was pressed once again on her decision two years ago to allow thousands of refugees who had set out on foot from the main train station in Budapest, Hungary into Germany. In the months that followed, thousands more made their way across the Aegean Sea to Greece and up the Balkans to Germany, encouraged by scenes of Germans welcoming migrants with food and clothes, and possibly also by selfies that refugees took with Merkel.  We ve gone over and over what happened in the autumn of 2015 and I remain convinced that all the other options that were discussed at the time - perhaps deploying water cannons on the German border and such - were out of the question for me,  Merkel said.  I think this decision was right.  During her campaign appearances, Merkel told her audiences repeatedly that the influx of 2015 would never be repeated. But she was denounced as a  traitor to the people  at numerous campaign events in the east, language that would have been unthinkable before the refugee crisis. Merkel grew up behind the Iron Curtain in the town of Templin north of Berlin. Her father, a Lutheran pastor with socialist leanings, moved the family from west to east shortly after Merkel was born, and before the Berlin Wall was built. In the last German election in 2013, Merkel s conservatives won 38.5 percent of the vote in the east, more than 10 points better than Sunday s result. ",

        "title": "Q&A: What we know about U.S. probes of Russian meddling in 2016 election",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey will testify to the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday about Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election.  President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of Comey on May 9 renewed attention to allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump. It also raised questions about the motivations behind Comey\u2019s dismissal.  The following describes what is publicly known and not known about U.S. investigations into meddling and possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump campaign:  How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017.  What did the intelligence agencies find? The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome.  The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a \u201cclear preference\u201d for Trump to win the White House. Putin\u2019s associates hacked information, paid social media \u201ctrolls\u201d and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said.  The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result.  Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election.  How many U.S. probes are there into Russia\u2019s election meddling? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscow\u2019s role in the election, including possible collusion with Trump\u2019s campaign.  The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it has appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe. Mueller would, if the evidence merits, work in tandem with the FBI to handle any related criminal prosecutions.  In addition there are multiple committees in the Senate and House of Representatives investigating various aspects of Russian election meddling.  What has Trump said about Russia\u2019s role in the election? Trump has not taken a clear public position.  \u201cI will tell you this, Russia: if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said at a July 2016 news conference, in reference to an FBI probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted.  Trump subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf.  The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration. \u201cAs far as hacking, I think it was Russia,\u201d Trump said, although he added: \u201cIt could have been others also.\u201d  Trump said in May that China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials.  Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed. \u201cThe Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?\u201d he wrote on Twitter on May 8.  On May 30, Trump wrote on Twitter: \u201cRussian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.\u201d  Did the FBI probe continue after Comey\u2019s dismissal? There is no evidence that the FBI ended or paused its investigation after Comey\u2019s departure.  FBI acting Director Andrew McCabe, who is leading the agency, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comey\u2019s firing would not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it.  Trump on June 6 tapped former U.S. Justice Department official Christopher Wray, who represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, to be the next FBI director. Wray will need Senate confirmation.  Why was Comey fired? The White House cited a May 9 letter to Trump from Attorney General Sessions that attached a memo from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on \u201cRestoring Confidence in the FBI\u201d that recommended Comey\u2019s dismissal.  Rosenstein\u2019s memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosenstein\u2019s view was that Comey\u2019s decision to make a public statement broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch.  Trump called Comey a \u201cshowboat\u201d and \u201cgrandstander\u201d in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosenstein\u2019s recommendation.  In an unorthodox move, Great America Alliance, an offshoot of a pro-Trump super PAC devoted to promoting the White House agenda, developed a television ad called \u201cShowboat\u201d to air as Comey testifies. The ad claims Comey was \u201cconsumed with election meddling\u201d at the expense of fighting terrorism.  Was Comey\u2019s firing related to the FBI\u2019s Russia probe? Whether Comey believes his firing was linked to the FBI\u2019s Russia probe will likely be a main focus when he testifies on Thursday.  Trump asked Comey to end the agency\u2019s investigation of Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, and also to make some sort of public statement that he was not personally under investigation in order to clear \u201cthe cloud\u201d hanging over his presidency, according to Comey\u2019s prepared testimony.  Comey found it \u201cvery concerning\u201d that Trump would ask him to drop the agency\u2019s probe of Flynn and declined to state publicly that Trump himself was not under investigation, in part because it would create a \u201cduty to correct\u201d if that changed, according to the testimony.  \u201cI need loyalty, I expect loyalty,\u201d Trump told Comey at a January 27 dinner, according to the testimony.  Less than a week before he was fired, Comey told a congressional panel that it made him \u201cmildly nauseous\u201d that he may have affected the outcome of the election by publicly re-opening, and then re-closing, the Clinton email probe days before the election.  Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Flynn was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office.  On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. He provided the first batch on June 6.  Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Rosenstein is handling matters related to Russia and it is he who appointed Mueller as special counsel.  Is Trump himself under investigation? In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he thanked Comey for informing him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. Comey confirmed in his written testimony that he told Trump that he was not personally under investigation.  ",

        "title": "Chicago City Council passes mayor's 2017 budget",
        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Chicago City Council on Wednesday approved Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s fiscal 2017 budget which calls for a tax on plastic bags and the first phase of hiring more than 900 police officers. The council voted 48-0 for the budget which begins on Jan. 1. Emanuel last month unveiled his $9.8 billion all-funds spending plan, which includes $3.7 billion for operations. The budget relies on $82.3 million in revenue growth, savings from efficiencies, and a few one-time measures - but no big tax hike. \u201cTo think that we\u2019re on the verge today of passing a budget with almost unanimity is remarkable,\u201d Alderman Ed Burke said just before the vote. Emanuel last year pushed through a $543 million phased-in property tax increase for police and firefighter retirement systems. The city enacted a new tax on water and sewer usage in September to rescue its largest pension fund for municipal workers from insolvency. The council previously increased a telephone surcharge for laborers\u2019 pensions. Credit ratings for the nation\u2019s third-largest city have been deteriorating due largely to an unfunded pension liability that stood at $33.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2015 for Chicago\u2019s four retirement systems.  The new budget includes a 7-cent fee on store bags and parking rate hikes. It also accommodates the initial phase of the mayor\u2019s two-year plan to add 970 police positions to address the city\u2019s sharp spike in violence. \u201cThis is the first year in recent memory that we\u2019ve made investments in public safety with the addition of 1,000 police officers,\u201d said Alderman Jason Earvin. \u201cAnd we can direct investment in some of the most challenged communities ... and with our youth in some of the most troubled parts of the city.\u201d After the vote, Emanuel noted record-high summer job creation for youth, record-high project starts in commercial and residential real estate and the city using reforms to place pensions on the path to solvency. \u201cChicago\u2019s employment is at a 15-year high that we haven\u2019t seen since 2000 since the tech bubble,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cWhat we have done, not just today, but over the last five years is give people confidence in the city that we are going to take care of our business, get our fiscal house in order.\u201d ",

        "title": "U.S. House will reject total elimination of state and local tax deductions: Brady",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the House of Representatives\u2019 tax-writing committee said on Sunday he would not accept elimination of a federal deduction for state and local taxes, opposing a proposal from Senate Republicans that would hike taxes for some middle class Americans. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he guaranteed the deduction would not be entirely scrapped in a  final tax bill that emerges from dueling plans already unveiled by Republicans in the House and the Senate. Asked on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d if House Republicans would reject a bid by Senate Republicans to do away with the deduction entirely, Brady said: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u201d The deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, has been one of the most hotly contested issues as Republicans seek to achieve a significant overhaul of the U.S. tax code and hand President Donald Trump his first major legislative victory. It is a chief concern for a group of House Republicans who face re-election battles next year in high-tax, typically Democratic-leaning states such as California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Other sticking points include a proposal by the Senate to delay implementation of a cut in the corporate tax rate and a House plan to eliminate the estate tax on inheritances. Republicans control both the House and the Senate. Lawmakers will debate their respective plans this week before heading home for the Thanksgiving Day holiday. Republicans hope to resolve their differences in time to reach their goal of enacting the legislation by the end of the year. The Senate tax blueprint introduced on Thursday would repeal the SALT deduction entirely. The House bill would repeal it only for state and local income and sales taxes, but preserve it for property tax up to $10,000 a year. Brady said there were many similarities in the rival tax proposals. \u201cI know that everyone\u2019s stressing the differences - there are some - but there\u2019s far more common ground,\u201d he said. Both the House and Senate plans would add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the budget deficit and national debt, an increase that has worried some fiscally conservative Republicans. Both plans also call for deep tax cuts for high-earners and businesses and would reshape how the United States taxes multinational corporations. They are both widely seen as a boon for business. Congressional Democrats have criticized the Republican plans as lopsided, favoring wealthy Americans and corporate interests. \u201cBoth the House and the Senate bills would raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, particularly in the suburbs, while providing a huge giveaway to corporations and the wealthy,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. \u201cRepublicans should go back to the drawing board and fully restore the SALT deduction,\u201d he said in a statement. Some analyses show that some Americans would see a tax increase under both plans. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin acknowledged that on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, although he said most middle-class families would be better off. \u201cFor most people - and, again, it may not be 100 percent, but by far the majority - both the House and Senate version provide middle-income tax relief,\u201d he said. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said both plans adhere to Trump\u2019s two main objectives in overhauling the tax code: a tax cut for middle-income Americans and a deep reduction in the corporate tax rate to make U.S. businesses competitive. \u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019re going to grow the economy. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to pay for the tax bill,\u201d Cohn said on Fox\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d A report by Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation estimated earlier this month that the House bill could raise taxes on as many as 38 million people who earn between $20,000 and $40,000 per year, beginning in 2023. Republican Representative Peter King has fiercely opposed the elimination of the SALT deduction, saying many in his home state of New York earning $300,000 a year were hardworking, two-income families facing a very high cost of living. \u201cThey\u2019re not hedge fund people,\u201d King said on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201cThese are hardworking people and they\u2019re going to get screwed by this bill.\u201d ",

        "text": "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday the Obama administration would do everything it could to implement a global agreement to combat climate change before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Kerry made the comments during a visit to New Zealand just before setting off to Marrakesh, Morocco to take part in climate talks between 200 nations. Donald Trump, who calls global warming a hoax and has promised to quit the Paris Agreement, was considering ways to bypass a theoretical four-year procedure for leaving the accord, according to a source on Trump\u2019s transition team. Kerry declined to speculate on what Trump might do about the Paris Agreement and noted that there was sometimes a difference between campaigning and governing.  But the top American diplomat was clear he thought further action to prevent climate change should be a priority. \u201cThe evidence is mounting in ways that people in public life should not dare to avoid accepting as a mandate for action,\u201d Kerry told journalists at a press conference in Wellington with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key \u201cUntil January 20 when this administration is over, we intend to do everything possible to meet our responsibility to future generations to be able to address this threat to life itself on the planet.\u201d Kerry\u2019s visit to Wellington followed a two-day trip to Antarctica where he flew in a helicopter over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which would add to rising sea levels if it melts, and spoke to scientists researching how fast climate change is likely to occur. The U.S. accounts for just under 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions so is considered a key player in the Paris Agreement, which has been ratified by 109 countries so far. The accord seeks to limit rising temperatures that have been linked to increasing economic damage from desertification, extinctions of animals and plants, heat waves, floods and rising sea levels.

        "title": "Factbox: Clinton's policies on economy, Islamic State, other issues",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has pledged to raise taxes on the wealthy, preserve the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented workers.\t Here are the proposals the former secretary of state has made as part of her argument that she is best qualified to occupy the Oval Office. (For a Factbox on Republican opponent Donald Trump\u2019s proposals, please see) Clinton has said the rich, not the middle class, would see their taxes go up. She supports billionaire investor Warren Buffett\u2019s eponymous tax proposal calling for those making more than $1 million a year to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Clinton has also called for an additional 4 percent tax on those making more than $5 million annually. Clinton has pledged to raise the estate tax levied on property transferred from a deceased person to their heirs. She also supports a tiered inheritance tax structure, with a top rate of 65 percent on the wealthiest estates of more than $500 million for a single person or $1 billion for a couple. Clinton has pledged to unveil a plan to rebuild U.S. infrastructure during her first 100 days, saying this would create new jobs. She would use some of the revenue generated from her tax plan to pay for making community colleges tuition-free and ensuring students can graduate from public colleges and universities without incurring debt. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that independently scored Clinton\u2019s proposals in their totality, estimated her policies would cost $1.8 trillion over the next decade and would be offset by $1.6 trillion, mostly generated by taxing high earners. The group said the remaining $200 billion could be covered by $275 billion in corporate tax revenue the Clinton campaign has called for but not yet spelled out in sufficient detail for them to credit as an offset at this time. Clinton has promised to propose broad legislation within her first 100 days in office to overhaul the immigration system and establish a process for undocumented workers to become citizens. Clinton has said she will defend executive actions taken by Democratic President Barack Obama to defer deportations of children brought illegally to the United States and the parents of children who are citizens or legal residents. She has said if Congress does not pass comprehensive immigration reform, she will similarly use executive action to defer deportations in \u201csympathetic cases.\u201d A federal court has ruled that Obama did not have the authority to issue his executive orders on immigration, known as DACA and DAPA. The U.S. Supreme Court, currently short one member, split 4-to-4 on whether to hear the administration\u2019s appeal, leaving the lower court\u2019s ruling in place for the time being. Clinton has promised to preserve the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted after the financial crisis, and to pursue further measures to toughen Wall Street regulations. She has proposed a fee for large financial institutions based on their size and the level of risk they pose. She would also give regulators additional authority to force institutions that pose high risks to break apart or reorganize. Clinton has also urged strengthening the Volcker Rule, which restricts proprietary trading by commercial banks. She has called for a new tax on high-frequency trading and for stricter oversight of hedge funds, private equity firms and other players in the so-called shadow-banking system. She has promised stiffer policies on people who commit financial crimes, including an extension of the statute of limitations on such crimes and a requirement for bank executives to return bonuses if their institutions suffer major losses. Changes to Dodd-Frank have stalled in the Republican-controlled Congress, and it is unclear whether Clinton could get congressional backing to strengthen the law, unless Democrats win control of one or both chambers in the Nov. 8 election. Clinton has pledged to defeat Islamic State and has said the first step to fighting the militant group is to eliminate its strongholds in Iraq and Syria. In a departure from the Obama administration, she supports the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syria and has called for an intensified air campaign by the U.S.-led coalition. Clinton has said she would send additional American special forces to help Arab and Kurdish forces already on the ground. She opposes sending additional U.S. ground troops to the region. Clinton has said the United States and European allies must share intelligence more effectively in order to thwart potential attacks. She has urged Silicon Valley companies to work with the government to track militant recruitment tactics on the internet.  Current and former Obama administration officials have told Reuters they believe Clinton would  take a harder line on Russia than either Obama or Trump. Clinton has said she believes Russian hackers are behind the breach of Democratic Party systems in an attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election. Clinton has said Russia should play a role in fighting Islamic State in Syria, and her foreign policy adviser has said she would consider arming government forces in Ukraine, one of Russia\u2019s neighbors, in a move to combat Russian \u201caggression in Europe.\u201d Russia has backed ethnic Russian separatists in Ukraine. Clinton was a key player in Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia when she served as his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Clinton has said she will \u201caggressively pursue trade cases and impose consequences\u201d against China when it commits trade abuses. She opposes granting China market-economy status, which China will be seeking when a World Trade Organization clause expires in December, and has said she would make sure a newly installed trade prosecutor would ensure that China is playing by the rules. Clinton has said she would treat cyber attacks from countries such as Russia and China \u201clike any other attack\u201d and that the United States \u201cwill be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.\u201d ",

        "title": "Factbox: Trump fills top jobs for his administration",
        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to pick Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn to head his White House National Economic Council, a group tasked with coordinating economic policy across federal agencies, a Trump transition official told Reuters on Friday.  The following is a list of Republican Trump\u2019s selections for top jobs in his administration. All the posts but that of national security adviser, the White House chief of staff, White House director of the National Economic Council and White House strategist require Senate confirmation: Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump\u2019s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. Son of a country-store owner, the Alabama senator and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  U.S. Representative Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. government\u2019s sweeping collection of Americans\u2019 communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran.     Ross, 78, heads the private equity firm W.L. Ross & Co. His net worth was pegged by Forbes at about $2.9 billion. A staunch supporter of Trump and an economic adviser, Ross helped shape the Trump campaign\u2019s views on trade policy. He blames the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which went into force in 1994, and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization for causing massive U.S. factory job losses.     Mattis is a retired Marine general known for his tough talk, distrust of Iran and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. A former leader of Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, Mattis, 66, is known by many U.S. forces by his nickname \u201cMad Dog.\u201d He was once rebuked for saying in 2005: \u201cIt\u2019s fun to shoot some people.\u201d DeVos, 58, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for the expansion of charter schools. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ADMINISTRATOR: SCOTT PRUITT An ardent opponent of President Barack Obama\u2019s measures to stem climate change, Oklahoma Attorney General Pruitt, 48, has enraged environmental activists. But he fits with the president-elect\u2019s promise to cut the agency back and eliminate regulation that he says is stifling oil and gas drilling. Pruitt became the top state prosecutor for Oklahoma, which has extensive oil reserves, in 2011, and has challenged the EPA multiple times since. U.S. Representative Price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House Budget Committee. A representative from Georgia since 2005, Price has criticized Obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. He is opposed to abortion. The final leadership role of Kelly\u2019s 45-year career was head of the U.S. Southern Command, responsible for U.S. military activities and relationships in Latin America and the Caribbean. The 66-year-old retired Marine general differed with Democratic President Barack Obama on key issues and has warned of vulnerabilities along the United States\u2019 southern border with Mexico. Carson, 65, is a retired neurosurgeon who dropped out of the Republican presidential nominating race in March and threw his support to Trump. A popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, Carson previously indicated reluctance to take a position in the incoming administration because of his lack of experience in the federal government. Carson is the first African-American picked for a Cabinet spot by Trump. McMorris Rodgers, a 47-year-old U.S. congresswoman from Washington state, is the fourth most senior member of the House of Representatives leadership. A member of the House Energy Committee, she has supported efforts to expand the U.S. energy industry such as the recent repeal of the decades-old ban on oil exports and efforts to reject the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Waters of the United States Act. She has also expressed skepticism about climate change. Before joining Congress in 2004, McMorris Rodgers served for a decades in the Washington state legislature, eventually becoming the first woman there to serve as minority leader. Cohn, 56, president and chief operating officer of investment bank Goldman Sachs, had widely been considered heir apparent to Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of the Wall Street firm. Trump hammered Goldman and Blankfein during the presidential campaign, releasing a television ad that called Blankfein part of a \u201cglobal power structure\u201d that had robbed America\u2019s working class. Puzder, chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc, which runs the Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s fast-food chains, has been a vociferous critic of government regulation of the workplace and the National Labor Relations Board. Puzder, 66, has argued that higher minimum wages would hurt workers by forcing restaurants to close, and praises the benefits of automation, so his appointment is likely to antagonize organized labor.  Retired Lieutenant General Flynn, 57, was an early Trump supporter and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his Army career in 1981 and was deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under President Barack Obama but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obama\u2019s foreign policy. McMahon, 68, is a co-founder and former chief executive of the professional wrestling franchise WWE, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut. She ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for a U.S. Senate seat in Connecticut in 2010 and 2012, and was an early supporter of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Chao, 63, was labor secretary under President George W. Bush for eight years and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. She is a director at Ingersoll Rand, News Corp and Vulcan Materials Company. She is married to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky. Mnuchin, 53, is a successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002. He assembled an investor group to buy a failed California mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as OneWest Bank and built it into Southern California\u2019s largest bank. Housing advocacy groups criticized the bank for its foreclosure practices, accusing it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Haley, 44, has been the Republican governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. The daughter of Indian immigrants, she led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman. Recently re-elected to serve as Republican National Committee chairman, Priebus will give up his party post to join Trump in the White House, where the low-key Washington operative could help forge ties with Congress to advance Trump\u2019s agenda. The 44-year-old was a steadfast supporter of Trump during the presidential campaign even as the party fractured amid the choice. CHIEF WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST, SENIOR COUNSELOR: STEVE BANNON, The former head of the conservative website Breitbart News came aboard as Trump\u2019s campaign chairman in August. A rabble-rousing conservative media figure, he helped shift Breitbart\u2019s into a forum for the alt-right, a loose confederation of those who reject mainstream politics and includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. His hiring signals Trump\u2019s dedication to operating outside the norms of Washington. As White House chief of staff, Bannon, 63, will serve as Trump\u2019s gatekeeper and agenda-setter. ",

        "title": "Japan detects radio signals pointing to possible North Korea missile test: source",
        "text": "TOKYO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Japan has detected radio signals suggesting North Korea may be preparing another ballistic missile launch, although such signals are not unusual and satellite images did not show fresh activity, a Japanese government source said on Tuesday. After firing missiles at a pace of about two or three a month since April, North Korean missile launches paused in September, after it fired a rocket that passed over Japan s northern Hokkaido island.  This is not enough to determine (if a launch is likely soon),  the source told Reuters. Japan s Kyodo news agency reported late on Monday that the Japanese government was on alert after catching such radio signals, suggesting a launch could come in a few days. The report also said the signals might be related to winter military training by the North Korean military. North Korea is pursuing its nuclear weapons and missile programmes in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan. South Korea s Yonhap news agency, citing a South Korean government source, also reported that intelligence officials of the United States, South Korea and Japan had recently detected signs of a possible missile launch and have been on higher alert. South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon told reporters on Tuesday there have been  noteworthy  movements from the North since its last missile launch in mid-September, but there was no hard evidence of another nuclear or missile test.  North Korea hasn t been engaging in new nuclear or missile tests but recently we ve seen them persistently testing engines and carrying out fuel tests,  said Cho at a media event in Seoul.  But we need some more time to see whether these are directly related to missile and nuclear tests.  Asked about the media reports, Pentagon spokesman Colonel Robert Manning told reporters the United States continued to watch North Korea very closely.   This is a diplomatically led effort at this point, supported by military options,  he said.  The Republic of Korea and U.S. alliance remains strong and capable of countering any North Korean provocations or attacks.  Two U.S. government sources familiar with official assessments of North Korean capabilities and activities said that while they were not immediately familiar with recent intelligence suggesting that North Korea was preparing to launch a new missile test, the U.S. government would not be surprised if such a test were to take place in the very near future. Other U.S. intelligence officials noted North Korea has previously sent deliberately misleading signs of preparations for missile and nuclear tests, in part to mask real preparations, and in part to test U.S. and allied intelligence on its activities. South Korea s Cho said North Korea may announce the completion of its nuclear programme within a year, as it is moving more faster than expected in developing its arsenal. North Korea defends its weapons programmes as a necessary defence against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention. ",

        "title": "White House plans directive targeting 'conflict minerals' rule: sources",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is planning to issue a directive targeting a controversial Dodd-Frank rule that requires companies to disclose whether their products contain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d from a war-torn part of Africa, according to sources familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking. Reuters could not learn precisely when the directive would be issued or what the final version would say. However, a leaked draft that has been floating around Washington and was seen by Reuters on Wednesday calls for the rule to be temporarily suspended for two years.  Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the document. The sources spoke on Tuesday on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record about the plan. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law explicitly gives the president authority to order the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to temporarily suspend or revise the rule for two years if it is in the national security interest of the United States. The conflict minerals rule was endorsed by human rights groups that want companies to tell investors if their products contain tantalum, tin, gold or tungsten mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo in the hope that such disclosures would curb funding to armed groups.    Business groups opposed to the measure have contended that it forces companies to furnish politically charged information that is irrelevant to making investment decisions and that it costs too much for companies to trace the source of minerals through the supply chain. In the leaked draft memo seen by Reuters, the Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury were asked to propose a plan for addressing human rights violations and the funding of armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo and report back within 180 days. The memo also lays out a justification for suspending the rule, saying that while it has helped discourage some American companies from purchasing materials in the region, it has also led to \u201csome job loss.\u201d  It also cited 2014 SEC estimates about the costs imposed on companies, which entailed upfront costs of $3 billion to $4 billion, and $200 million per year thereafter. Carly Oboth, a policy adviser at human rights group Global Witness, said in a statement on Wednesday that she was deeply concerned about Trump\u2019s planned executive action. \u201cThis law helps stop U.S. companies funding conflict and human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries,\u201d she said. \u201cSuspending it will benefit secretive and corrupt business practices. Responsible business practices are starting to spread in eastern Congo. This action could reverse that progress.\u201d A White House executive order last week took aim more broadly at the Dodd-Frank rules that were put into place after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. That order did not single out a  particular rule, but called on the Treasury Secretary to consult with other regulators, including the SEC, and come back with a report outlining possible regulatory changes and legislation.  The conflict minerals rule is one of several disclosure regulations in Dodd-Frank that are unrelated to the financial crisis. Another Dodd-Frank SEC disclosure rule that required oil, gas and mining companies to disclose payments to foreign governments was repealed by the Republican-controlled Congress last week. In 2014, a U.S. appeals court struck down part of the conflict minerals law after the Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers sued the SEC over it. The court found part of it violated free speech rights of companies by forcing them to publicly state that their products were not conflict free. The rest of the rule was left intact and companies are  required to conduct due diligence and report the details of those inquiries in public reports filed with the SEC. The SEC cannot repeal the rule without a law passed by Congress. It can, however, use its broad exemptive powers to scale back some of the requirements or stop enforcing the rule entirely. Last week, acting SEC Chair Michael Piwowar took steps toward doing that by announcing that he had asked SEC staff to reconsider how companies should comply with it and whether \u201cadditional relief\u201d was warranted. House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, meanwhile, is planning to reintroduce his Financial CHOICE Act bill, which contains a provision to repeal the conflict minerals rule. ",

        "title": "Trump adds new twist to immigration proposals, but legal doubts persist",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s proposal for suspending immigration from parts of the world with a history of terrorism could have a legal basis, but his assertion that it be part of a broader ban on Muslim immigrants makes it constitutionally untenable, legal scholars say. The new twist in Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim rhetoric came in the aftermath of a weekend shooting massacre at a Florida nightclub by the American-born son of Afghan immigrants. In a fiery speech on Monday, he expanded on his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, vowing if elected to halt immigration from any area of the world where there is a \u201cproven history of terrorism\u201d against America or its allies. He also accused the Muslim-American community of broad complicity in attacks such as the Orlando shooting, which was carried out by a gunman pledging allegiance to Islamic State, and threatened \u201cbig consequences\u201d for those who fail to inform on their neighbors. Many legal experts said Trump\u2019s proposal for a religion-based ban would be unlikely to pass the test of U.S. constitutional guarantees of religious freedom, due process and equal protection and would likely be struck down by the courts if he tried to implement them by presidential decree. However, a ban on immigrants from certain countries has some precedent and might pass muster.\u00a0 Some see that new proposal as reminiscent of the congressional Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which was used for years to halt the influx of Chinese laborers and has been widely considered a black mark on America\u2019s immigration record. But Trump\u2019s overall immigration plan would go beyond that, targeting not just a country or a region of the world but also a religion, something that no modern U.S. president has done.  \u201cThis is an absurd proposal to build a Fortress America and pull up the drawbridges,\u201d said John Bellinger, former legal adviser to the Bush administration. President Barack Obama took a veiled swipe at Trump on Tuesday, saying such ideas represented a \u201cdangerous\u201d mindset. But U.S. presidents have wide latitude on immigration matters, and some conservative scholars said that the fate of any proposed ban would hinge on how narrowly Trump framed it. They note, for instance, that Democratic President Jimmy Carter barred Iranian nationals from entering the United States during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. \u201cIf a Trump administration cut off immigration from certain countries, rather than certain religions, it would not violate the Constitution,\u201d said John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California Berkeley and former Justice Department official who advised the George W. Bush administration on interrogation methods used on terrorism suspects. Herman Schwartz, a law professor at American University in Washington, said if Trump stuck to his proposal for a temporary prohibition on Muslim immigrants, that raises significant constitutional questions and \u201cshows his shaky command of the legal facts.\u201d In Monday\u2019s speech in New Hampshire, Trump showed little sign of scaling back his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States, which he first laid out in December after an Islamic State-linked deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. Debate over the legality of Trump\u2019s proposals was complicated by the vagueness of his pronouncement and questions on how broadly he would extend any immigration ban if elected. While legal experts say presidents have the power to ban immigrants from specific countries, the United States does not currently ban immigration from any country. Officials do give extra scrutiny to people entering from countries such Syria and Iran. Under the broadest interpretation of Trump\u2019s pronouncement,  immigration could be barred not only from the Muslim world but from U.S.-allied countries in Europe and Asia where militant attacks have taken place. This could include India, the source of many skilled engineers for the U.S. technology sector. Critics say this would be impractical and counterproductive. \u201cIs Mr. Trump proposing to stop issuing visas even for business or tourism or education to nationals of certain countries?\u201d said Bellinger. \u201cRather than increase economic growth, Mr. Trump\u2019s plan could cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars.\u201d Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, a Trump foreign policy adviser, justified the candidate\u2019s pronouncement, saying \u201cit is perfectly appropriate for the country to refuse admission to those whose presence may be detrimental to the national interest.\u201c But Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, when asked whether a president has the authority to ban immigrants based on religion, said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure he does.\u201d Legal experts also raised doubts about the legality of Trump\u2019s demand that members of the American Muslim community \u201ccooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad\u201d or else they will be \u201cbrought to justice\u201d themselves.\u201d Critics have accused him of anti-Muslim fear-mongering to win votes. \u201cGenerally, the idea that knowledge in and of itself comes with criminal liability is antithetical to the way we talk about criminal law in the United States,\u201d said Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and former federal prosecutor. If Trump tried to implement such prosecutions as president, he said, potential defendants could simply invoke their constitutional right against self-incrimination and continue to remain silent. ",

        "title": "Democrats to demand restructuring mechanism for Puerto Rico: letter",
        "text": "SAN JUAN/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. senators have drafted a letter to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insisting legislation designed to solve Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis should include a mechanism for the island to restructure its debt, according to a draft of the letter seen by Reuters.  The move is a challenge to Republicans pushing bills in Congress to bring Puerto Rico\u2019s finances under federal oversight, who are generally opposed to letting the U.S. commonwealth restructure its debt. Democrats have argued that any such oversight should be conditional on allowing Puerto Rico to be governed by federal bankruptcy or debt restructuring laws.  A congressional source familiar with the letter said Senate democrats plan to make it public on Tuesday ahead of a hearing on Puerto Rico by the House Committee on Natural Resources, but timing remains uncertain.  A solution \u201cmust allow Puerto Rico to restructure a meaningful portion of its debt,\u201d according to the draft of the letter, which noted that \u201cPuerto Rico was included in Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code until 1984, when Congress inexplicably excluded it from the nationwide approach to resolving municipal insolvency.\u201d Letters such as this are generally aimed at demonstrating party unity and are typically circulated to collect as many signatures as possible to show strength on a given issue. The congressional source said this letter\u2019s authors are expecting signatures from all 44 Democratic senators and 2 independent senators. If such broad support were achieved, it would allow Democrats to block any legislation that did not include a restructuring mechanism - although that is no guarantee that Republicans, who control Congress, would draft a bill that includes one. A restructuring option would be a coup for the island\u2019s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who has long said Puerto Rico needs to cut its $70 billion in debt to grow its economy, a stance that has faced resistance from creditors. Aside from its debt load, Puerto Rico faces widespread economic strain, including a 45-percent poverty rate and a shrinking tax base, as a growing number of citizens jump to the mainland United States. The island has begun skipping some debt payments in recent months in order to make others, and now faces lawsuits from insurers of some bonds.  The letter comes weeks after House Speaker Paul Ryan demanded legislation by the end of March to address Puerto Rico\u2019s debt.  \u201cWe urge you to match his commitment to act on a responsible solution by the end of the first quarter,\u201d the draft letter says, addressing McConnell.

        "title": "Scalia's death boosts legal chances for Obama's climate plan",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A vote to block the Obama administration\u2019s ambitious climate regulation was one of Antonin Scalia\u2019s last acts as a Supreme Court justice. His sudden death may have opened a new path to the rule\u2019s survival. Scalia died Saturday. Four days earlier, he voted with the other conservative members of the high court to put a hold on the administration\u2019s plans to implement the Clean Power Plan while it is litigated. The regulation is designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. The rule is the United States\u2019 main tool to meet the emissions reduction target pledge it made at U.N. climate talks in Paris in December.  It was challenged by 27 states, along with business and industry groups, in a case now before an appeals court in Washington, D.C. The Supreme Court could be asked to weigh in again later this year. Without Scalia, the conservative members of the court no longer have a majority, at least in the short term. The sudden shift has given a boost to the supporters of the emissions rule.   \u201cLast week, the Clean Power Plan was basically dead,\u201d said Brian Potts, a lawyer with the Foley & Lardner law firm who represents companies on environmental regulatory issues. \u201cBut with Scalia\u2019s death, everything has changed.\u201d Environmental lawyers involved in the litigation who support the regulation told Reuters Monday that even before Scalia\u2019s death they had been hopeful the Supreme Court would ultimately uphold it upon close consideration. But they said the change in the high court bolsters the rule\u2019s chances. \u201cThere are still no guarantees, but the Clean Power Plan faces much better odds now than it did on Friday,\u201d said Jack Lienke, a lawyer with the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law, which backs the regulation. Industry lawyers said they remained confident the regulation will be struck down. \u201cWhile Justice Scalia\u2019s untimely passing creates more uncertainty, the Clean Power Plan is still predicated on an extraordinarily shaky legal foundation,\u201d said Scott Segal, a lawyer with the Bracewell law firm, which represents companies that oppose the regulation.  In January, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had unanimously rejected the same request for a stay that the Supreme Court granted last week. The appellate panel has set oral arguments on the merits of the case for June 2. The randomly-drawn appeals court panel is viewed by lawyers on both sides as relatively favorable for the administration, featuring two Democratic appointees and one Republican appointee. One of the Democratic appointees is Sri Srinivasan, a judge many legal experts see as a leading candidate for President Barack Obama to nominate to replace Scalia. If the appeals court upholds the rule and the challengers take the case to the Supreme Court, they would face an uphill battle in getting the five votes needed for a win without Scalia. The four liberal justices are seen as likely to uphold the rule. So, the best result the challengers would be likely to get is a 4-4 split. When the court is evenly divided, the lower court ruling stands, meaning the regulation would survive. An unknown factor is how soon a ninth member will be appointed and whether it will be a Democratic or Republican president who makes it. Some Republican leaders have said Obama should not appoint a successor, leaving it to the next president, who would take office in January 2017. Obama has said he plans to announce a nomination but will face an uphill ban to win confirmation in the Republican-controlled Senate. If a Democratic appointee replaces Scalia, it would tilt the balance of the court leftward for the first time in decades. A Republican appointee would extend the narrow conservative tilt the bench had until Scalia\u2019s death. If Srinivasan were appointed, he would have to step aside on the Clean Power Plan case because of his involvement in the case at the appellate level. That would increase the chances of a 4-4 split.

        "text": "RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it had dismantled an Islamic State cell in the capital Riyadh, in connection with a plot to launch a suicide attack on the defense ministry. Two militants were killed and five others arrested in raids on three locations on Wednesday, an official source in the newly-created Presidency of State Security said in a statement on state-run television. Deadly bombing and shooting attacks have been mounted by Islamic State militants against security forces and Shi ite Muslims in Saudi Arabia. Islamic State has for years criticized the leadership of the Western-allied kingdom, the world s top oil exporter, accusing it of deviating from their strict interpretation of Islam and advancing the interests of their U.S. enemies. Thursday s statement said a suicide bomber in the eastern Riyadh district of al-Rimal detonated his vest after security forces surrounded a house used to manufacture suicide vests and explosives. Another militant was killed by security forces after he holed up with firearms in an apartment in the western district of al-Namar, it said.  The third raid was at a horse stable in the southern Riyadh suburb of al-Ghanamia which the statement said had been used as a headquarters. Security forces seized firearms and bomb-making materials, shown on state television along with a burned out car and a damaged building where the first militant had blown himself up. The suspects were not identified. Security forces closed off several areas in Riyadh on Wednesday, and videos shared online showed a plume of smoke rising at one location. The plot to attack the defense ministry, uncovered last month, allegedly involved two Yemeni nationals and two Saudi citizens. A Saudi security source said at the time that one of the detainees was a member of the armed Houthi movement, which is locked in a 2-1/2-year-old war with a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said on Monday he expects the Treasury secretary to use extraordinary cash management measures after the government\u2019s current debt ceiling extension expires on March 15. \u201cThe secretary of the Treasury actually makes the decision and I expect him to do what all previous secretaries of the Treasury have done, at least all the ones that I\u2019m familiar with, to use those measures to extend that date,\u201d Mulvaney said in an interview on Fox News. \u201cBut we will deal with it,\u201d he said, \u201ccertainly\u201d before Congress recesses in August. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at his Senate confirmation hearing last month that he would like to see an increase in the debt ceiling \u201csooner rather than later\u201d to avoid another standoff with Congress that could upset financial markets. The United States is one of few nations in which the legislature must approve periodic increases in the legal limit on how much money the federal government can borrow. Rather than setting a specific dollar limit on the debt, Congress in 2015  simply suspended the ceiling until March 15, allowing normal borrowing to continue.   The debt ceiling will reset at the total debt level outstanding on that day, but Congress will need to approve a new debt ceiling or extension. As of Feb. 23, the federal debt stood at about $19.88 trillion, according to Treasury data.  But analysts estimate that Treasury can continue to borrow and avoid a payment default for several months past March 15 even with no action from Congress as it deploys its extraordinary cash management measures. In the past, the Treasury has been able to stave off depletion of its cash reserves with steps such as temporarily halting investments in some pension funds for federal workers and suspending sales of certain securities to state and local governments. Although such steps are known as \u201cextraordinary measures,\u201d they are routinely used by Treasury during debt ceiling debates.   In 2011, Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the U.S. credit rating for the first time after a gridlocked Congress waited until the government was possibly within hours of defaulting on its debt to raise the ceiling.

        "title": "As U.S. ban on travel to North Korea kicks in, tourists say their farewells",
        "text": " (This Aug 31 story corrects location of Burkhead s home in third paragraph.) By Christian Shepherd BEIJING (Reuters) - American tourist Nicholas Burkhead said he d be happy to return to his latest holiday destination, with its beautiful scenery, great food and friendly people. The problem is, the destination was North Korea and a U.S. State Department ban on travel to the isolated country takes effect on Friday. Burkhead, a 35-year-old resident of Virginia, was among the last American tourists to leave North Korea, landing on Thursday in Beijing.  I was surprised at how friendly everyone was,  Burkhead said after stepping off the last scheduled flight to Beijing from the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, before the U.S. travel ban kicks in.  It was very relaxing - beautiful scenery and they fed us very well in the restaurants there, but the exchange rate wasn t too good for the local won,  he told a waiting scrum of reporters. Burkhead arrived in Beijing on North Korea s state-owned Air Koryo after visiting Pyongyang as well as the city of Kaesong near the heavily armed border with South Korea. His five-day tour cost 1,850 euros ($2,200). Other Americans on the flight included two aid workers as well as Jamie Banfill, 32, who had led tours to North Korea but was visiting this time as a tourist. Banfill, who had made the trip to say goodbyes after regularly traveling to the North for a decade, said the travel ban short-sighted.  It s an extremely complex situation on the Korean peninsula and they oversimplified it,  he said. The United States last month announced a ban on U.S. passport holders from traveling to North Korea, effective Sept. 1. Journalists and humanitarian workers are allowed to apply for exemptions under the ban, which is similar to previous U.S. restrictions on travel to Iraq and Libya. Heidi Linton, director of Christian Friends of Korea, who has been working in North Korea for more than 20 years, told reporters she worried about the people her aid group helped, if her exemption was not granted soon.  We started a hepatitis B program and we have 705 patients that have been started on life-saving medicine, that if they go off that medicine then their lives are in danger,  she said.    It was not immediately clear how many Americans had sought, or been granted, exemptions or how many were still in North Korea. An official at the state department said it was not able to give an estimate on the number of U.S. citizens there. North Korea is under growing international pressure over its nuclear tests and repeated ballistic missile launches, including one this week that flew over northern Japan. The U.S. ban on travel to North Korea followed the death of U.S. college student Otto Warmbier, who was jailed during a tour last year. Warmbier, who was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for trying to steal a propaganda sign, was returned to the United States in a coma in June and died six days later. The circumstances surrounding his death are not clear, including why he fell into a coma. Warmbier had been detained leaving the airport in Pyongyang.    I was expecting a strict security check on exit but there was nothing like that,  Burkhead said. The State Department declared U.S. passports invalid for travel to, in or through North Korea. The restriction applies for one year unless extended or revoked by the secretary of state. North Korean state media has described the ban as a  sordid  attempt to limit human exchanges. North Korea is currently holding two Korean-American academics and a missionary, as well as three South Korean nationals who were doing missionary work.  This month, North Korea released a Canadian pastor who had been imprisoned there for more than two years. Hundreds of Americans are among the 4,000 to 5,000 Western tourists who visit North Korea annually, according to U.S. lawmaker Joe Wilson. ",

        "title": "Trump ally Stone offers to testify in Russian meddling probe",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Roger Stone, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, said on Sunday he has offered to testify before a congressional committee investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and ties to the Trump campaign. Stone, an informal adviser to Trump, told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d he had not received a reply from the House of Representatives intelligence committee on his offer of public testimony. Along with former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who has also offered to appear before the panel, Stone was among the Trump associates whose communications and financial transactions were being examined by the FBI and others as part of a larger investigation into possible links with Russian officials, according to a Jan. 20 report in the New York Times. Without citing any names, FBI Director James Comey confirmed at the committee\u2019s public hearing last week that the FBI was investigating possible Russian ties to Trump\u2019s campaign as Moscow sought to influence the 2016 election. Stone said he was anxious to testify in public. \u201cI reiterate again, I have had no contacts or collusions with the Russians,\u201d he told ABC, adding later, \u201cThere is no collusion, none, at least none that I know about, in Donald Trump\u2019s campaign for president.\u201d \u00a0 At Monday\u2019s intelligence committee hearing, Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the panel, cited concern over Stone\u2019s communications with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Guccifer 2, who claimed responsibility for hacking the Democratic groups. Stone said he had spoken to Assange through an intermediary and to Guccifer on Twitter in an exchange he made public. Stone also cast doubt on whether Guccifer was a Russian agent. \u201cJust because the intelligence services say something, as we know from history, does not make it true,\u201d he said, reflecting the doubts that Trump himself has sown about U.S. spy agencies. Carter Page, another Trump campaign adviser whose contacts with Russians were mentioned by Schiff at Monday\u2019s hearing, also has offered to appear before the committee, according to multiple media reports. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia sponsored the hacking of Democratic Party groups during the 2016 campaign to benefit Republican Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia has denied the allegations of meddling. Trump has dismissed the idea of any coordination between his campaign and Russia and has accused Democrats and the media of using the issue to attack him. The House committee investigation was marred on Wednesday after its Republican chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, announced to the public and briefed Trump that U.S. intelligence may have swept up communications by Trump associates before telling the committee. Nunes apologized to the intelligence panel the next day. However, he further alienated Democrats on the committee on Friday when he canceled a hearing with intelligence officials from former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in order to have a classified briefing with the directors of the National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation. The committee\u2019s top Democrat, Adam Schiff, suggested the cancellation came after pressure from the White House. Schiff and other Democrats said last week\u2019s actions raised more doubts about whether Nunes, a Trump ally who served on the president\u2019s transition team, can conduct a credible investigation. \u201cI think the chairman has to make a decision whether to act as a surrogate of the White House as he did during the campaign and the transition or to lead an independent and credible, investigation,\u201d Schiff told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d ",

        "title": "Trump picks regulation opponents to lead FCC transition",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice of experts to focus on new policies at the Federal Communications Commission signals a regime that will have a \u201clighter\u201d touch on regulation and be more likely to favor large mergers in telecoms industries, analysts said. Economist Jeff Eisenach and former Sprint Corp (S.N) lobbyist Mark Jamison were named by Trump\u2019s transition team to oversee hiring and policy for the FCC. They both oppose some recent telecom industry regulations resisted by telecom and cable heavyweights such as Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) and AT&T Inc (T.N) and have voiced support for mega mergers in the past. The FCC is composed of five commissioners, including one designated as chairman, who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Only three commissioners can be from the same political party and Trump\u2019s pick for FCC chairman would tip the balance in favor of Republicans.\u00a0The addition of Eisenach and Jamison to Trump\u2019s \u201clanding team\u201d on Monday come as the Republican president-elect puts together a team to staff various government departments and agencies after he succeeds Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20. The two appointments are harbingers of \u201ca more typical Republican FCC that is lighter on regulation and more focused on competition,\u201d said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. \u201cThe focus will be more on reducing regulation than creating new ones.\u201d That would be in stark contrast to the Obama administration\u2019s FCC that enacted or proposed a handful of new industry rules and disapproved some proposed combinations, including Comcast\u2019s bid for Time Warner Cable and AT&T\u2019s attempt to buy T-Mobile (TMUS.O).The FCC under Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, has had a rocky relationship with large telecom companies, some of which strongly opposed the agency\u2019s 2015 net neutrality or open internet rules. The rules, which require internet service providers to treat all data equally and bar them from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content, were seen as a major victory for internet businesses like Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google (GOOGL.O) that offer services but do not own internet networks. \u2018PRO-BUSINESS POLICY\u2019 Eisenach has supported mergers such as AT&T and T-Mobile as well as Sprint and T-Mobile that were dismissed by regulators during Obama\u2019s administration, according to analysts. He is known in telecom circles for having a \u201cpro-business\u201d mindset, New Street Research analyst Spencer Kurn said.  \u201cWhoever gets picked (as FCC chairman) is likely going to implement a similar pro-business policy,\u201d Kurn said.  Eisenach, who was previously tapped by the Trump campaign as an adviser on technology and telecom policy, is currently a managing director at consulting firm NERA Economic Consulting\u2019s communications, media and internet practice. He previously held advisory roles at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the White House Office of Management and Budget. In 2014, he testified in the U.S. Senate against net neutrality rules, arguing there was no need for new regulation as existing antitrust rules, while \u201cnot perfect,\u201d offered safeguards against concerns about the business practices of internet service providers. Jamison is the director of the Public Utility Research Center at the University of Florida. Like Eisenach, he has strongly disagreed in his publications with Wheeler\u2019s rules, including net neutrality and a proposal to open up the market for rented pay-TV set-top boxes. That measure was aimed at breaking the telecom and cable companies\u2019 grip on the $20 billion market and bringing in players such as Google and Apple (AAPL.O) in an effort to lower prices for consumers. Some analysts said the appointments also raised questions over whether Trump would carry out his campaign pledge to kill AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion proposal to buy Time Warner (TWX.N). Matt Wood, policy director of the technology rights group Free Press, said\u00a0that even as Trump opposes the deal, he picked the pro-business economist Eisenach, who\u00a0was unlikely to want to block such a merger.

        "title": "Clinton, Sanders race takes on angrier tone after Nevada",
        "text": "(Reuters) - The race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for the U.S. Democratic presidential nomination - once a civil affair - has taken a sour turn, with mud-slinging from both camps over the former secretary of state\u2019s win in the Nevada caucuses.  Sanders\u2019 supporters are alleging that foul play by casino managers helped Clinton out in Saturday\u2019s contest, while Clinton\u2019s camp has blasted - in at times vulgar terms - the Vermont senator\u2019s assertion he took the state\u2019s Latino vote. The tensions reflect the tight battle between the two heading into next Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary. Sanders, who had surged in recent months to challenge front-runner Clinton, is trying to maintain momentum against her in a part of the United States where she wields an advantage among minority voters.     The angrier tone also marks a turn from what has been a mostly civil race on the Democratic side, in contrast with the noisy insult-hurling that has characterized much of the Republican race. . While Sanders and the former first lady have publicly clashed on their approaches to healthcare and regulating Wall Street, they have frequently emphasized their common ground on social issues. Sanders has also refused so far to join in Republican attacks on Clinton\u2019s record as secretary of state. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the real issues facing America,\u201d he said during one televised debate. The tone soured after Nevada. Officials with National Nurses United, which endorsed Sanders, have said there were irregularities at casino caucus sites - such as casino managers wearing Clinton paraphernalia - which they said amounted to intimidation of casino employee voters. \u201cFrom what nurses observed in Nevada Sanders campaign should call for UN observers to protect democracy,\u201d the union said in one Twitter post on Sunday. Neither Clinton nor Sanders\u2019 campaigns immediately responded to requests for comment on the allegations. Meanwhile, both campaigns have argued about what the polling from the Nevada caucuses show. One set of entrance and exit poll results conducted by CBS News showed Sanders took 53 percent of Latino votes in the state. This is a critical group for Sanders as he seeks to broaden his support base after his early results - a very narrow loss and a decisive win - in Iowa and New Hampshire, which have overwhelmingly white voter populations. \u201cI don\u2019t typically like to swear on Twitter, but by all accounts so far this is complete and utter bullshit,\u201d Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill wrote on Twitter, referring to a Sanders\u2019 campaign press release asserting he took the Latino bloc in Nevada. Clinton has been expected to find easier territory as  contests move into the south in the state-by-state battles to pick a party presidential nominee for the November general election. Her backers say minority voters are her \u201cfirewall\u201d against Sanders\u2019 popularity among young voters who dislike establishment politics and are attracted by his vows to take on Wall Street excesses and high college fees. She won Nevada, which is nearly a quarter Latino, by just over 5 points. Sanders\u2019 camp, meanwhile, has disputed Clinton camp assertions that she drew the lion\u2019s share of the union votes in the Nevada contest, accusing her campaign of inventing figures.  \u201cThey do have a tendency to make stuff up,\u201d Sanders\u2019 spokesman Michael Briggs said in an email. The American Federation of Teachers issued a press release on Monday listing 23 unions that back Clinton.

        "title": "Trump 'needs all the help he can get,' donors say",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump often tells crowds at his campaign rallies that he doesn\u2019t need outside financial support to get to the White House, but some of his fans are starting to feel differently. Donors to an independent political spending group formed to promote Trump\u2019s candidacy said in interviews on Sunday they were worried by reports describing the millions of dollars Trump\u2019s opponents are spending to attack him. They said they admired the billionaire businessman\u2019s professed financial independence but thought a cash boost would help keep his fight for the Republican U.S. nomination fair. So 767 people sent in small sums - $25 here, $100 there - hoping it would help prepare him to face his many, moneyed foes. \u201cHe needs all the help he can get,\u201d said Diane Abair, 83, a real estate agent in Redding, California, who sent $50 to the group, Great America PAC. She said she didn\u2019t think her donation tarnished Trump\u2019s claim that he won\u2019t have to pander as president to any special interest groups because he\u2019s not backed by big donors. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody that he can be beholden to,\u201d she said. Trump is facing an onslaught of attacks from other Republicans alarmed by his success, even after controversial statements like his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. Big donors who demurred for months have begun to spend heavily to defeat him. This poses a new challenge for the candidate, who has so far spent less than his opponents. Between June and February, he loaned his campaign $24 million and raised nearly $10 million more from small donors.  Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, did not respond to a request for comment. Great America raised just under $74,000 during the first two months of 2016, according to regulatory filings. Its co-chair, Eric Beach, said it had taken in enough since then to commit to  spending $1 million on pro-Trump ads. Beach, a California businessman and political strategist, gave $25,000. \u201cWhen it comes time for the general election I hope the PAC has got some money left because he\u2019s going to need it,\u201d said Scott Abadie, 54, a veterinarian in New Orleans who donated $100 to Great America PAC. The group gives $5 of each donation it receives directly to Trump\u2019s campaign. According to co-founder Amy Kremer, this allows each donor to be named individually on financial reports. \u201cThey too can be recognized for even a small donation,\u201d she said. ",

        "title": "At least 46 attacks in area of Niger where U.S. troops killed: U.N.",
        "text": "NIAMEY (Reuters) - A part of southwestern Niger where four U.S. Green Berets were killed during a mission the U.S. military had considered low-risk has seen at least 46 attacks by armed groups since early last year, a U.N. agency said on Friday. The deaths of the four U.S. soldiers and ensuing confusion over what happened during the Oct. 4 ambush have thrown a spotlight on the U.S. counter-terrorism mission in the West African nation, where about 800 U.S. troops are deployed. Four Nigerien soldiers were also killed. U.S. forces do not have a direct combat role in Niger and instead provide assistance to its army, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support. Several Islamist militant groups are known to operate in the area near the border with Mali where the ambush occurred, however, and U.S. officials later said a local Islamic State affiliate was suspected of carrying it out. Following the attack near the village of Tongotongo, the U.S. military s Africa Command said the soldiers  mission to meet with local leaders was considered low-risk so there was no armed air cover.  According to non-exhaustive information gathered in the (Tahoua and Tillabery) regions, 46 attacks perpetrated by armed groups have been recorded,  a note from the U.N. humanitarian coordination agency said on Friday. Seven districts in the Tahoua and Tillabery have been under a state of emergency since March, and the government renewed the measure for an additional three months on Sept. 18. Niger s army launched a military operation to reestablish security in Tillabery in June.  The deadly incident has become a political football in Washington amid criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump s handling of condolence messages to the families of the dead soldiers. Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Thursday he may consider issuing a subpoena because he said the White House has not been forthcoming with details of the ambush. From initial accounts, the 40-member patrol, which included a dozen U.S. troops, came under attack by militants riding in a dozen vehicles and on about 20 motorcycles. Under heavy fire, U.S. troops called in French fighter jets for air support, but the firefight was at such close quarters that the planes could not engage and were instead left circling overhead. French aircraft evacuated the wounded, but the body of one of the dead soldiers was recovered by Nigerien soldiers only after two days. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters on Thursday that the incident was under investigation and defended the military s response, even as he acknowledged that it did not yet have all the accurate information on the incident.

        "title": "Trump vows to reopen, or toss, NAFTA pact with Canada and Mexico",
        "text": "MONESSEN, Pennsylvania/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday vowed to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate the NAFTA trade agreement with the United States if elected, as part of an effort to protect and restore American jobs. Trump criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement as a U.S. job killer, saying he would be willing to scrap the pact if Canada and Mexico were unwilling to budge. He also tried to link Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to the deal on the eve of a meeting in Ottawa of the \u201cthree amigos,\u201d the leaders of the three NAFTA signatories: the United States, Mexico and Canada.  In his most detailed speech on trade, the presumptive Republican nominee said he would pull the United States out of negotiations for a deal among 12 Pacific Rim nations and promised to use executive power to resolve trade disputes with China. Trump also pledged to revive the U.S. steel and aluminum industry, speaking at an aluminum scrap company in Monessen, Pennsylvania, nearly 30 miles (50 km) south of Pittsburgh, the one-time American steelmaking capital. Trump has identified Pennsylvania as a state he believes he can wrest from the Democrats in the Nov. 8 election. He also campaigned on Tuesday in Ohio, which like Pennsylvania is a Rust Belt state.  Democratic President Barack Obama won both states in 2008 and 2012, but manufacturing job losses have led to voter anxiety in the region. \u201cI\u2019m going tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers. And I don\u2019t mean just a little bit better, I mean a lot better,\u201d Trump said in Pennsylvania. If Canada and Mexico do not agree to renegotiate the pact, Trump said he would notify them under the agreement\u2019s terms \u201cthat America intends to withdraw from the deal.\u201d He tried to tie his Democratic rival to the pact, approved in 1993 during the administration of her husband, President Bill Clinton, as he called NAFTA one of the \u201cworst legacies\u201d of the Clinton years. On MSNBC after Trump\u2019s speech, Clinton spokeswoman Kristina Schake called the wealthy New York businessman the \u201cking of outsourcing,\u201d in an apparent reference to Trump-branded products such as suits and ties made overseas.  \u201cIt was full of hypocrisy and misstatements and outright lies,\u201d Schake said. Trade has been a vulnerability for Clinton, who struggled for white, blue-collar votes in her Democratic primary race against U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who criticized her for supporting trade deals and said she was too close to Wall Street.   TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP Trump echoed Sanders\u2019 criticism on Tuesday, saying Clinton supported the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, while she was secretary of state and only opposed it once she was running for president. Clinton\u2019s campaign said she opposed the agreement because it was not strong enough on currency manipulation and other areas.        Clinton has said she will evaluate each trade deal on its merits but does not believe the TPP is good for U.S. workers.        Sanders now says he will vote for Clinton in November, although he has not formally withdrawn from the race. Trump said he saw no way to fix the TPP, calling it a \u201cdeath blow\u201d for American manufacturing. Although China is not part of the agreement, Trump said Beijing might try to enter it \u201cthrough the back door\u201d later on. Later, during a rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio, Trump said the deal was \u201cjust a continuing rape of our country.\u201d Just hours before Trump spoke, Clinton allies sought to pre-empt the planned trade speech by saying Trump\u2019s policies amounted to empty promises. Earlier, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told a trade conference in Washington that \u201cTrump embodies everything that is wrong with our current trade policy. He has consistently sent American jobs overseas to line his own pockets.\u201d The AFL-CIO, which collectively represents more than 12 million workers, making it the largest U.S. labor federation, endorsed Clinton this month. Both Clinton and Trump have acknowledged that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union signaled a global economic frustration among working-class voters that could reverberate in the U.S. election. \u201cThere is a lot of legitimate anxiety, fear and even anger in many parts of our country because people feel like the economy has failed them,\u201d Clinton said in Denver on Tuesday. \u201cI think this is going to be one of the defining issues in this election.\u201d Trump has seized on the historic Brexit vote to bolster his argument that voters are rising up against establishment leaders, saying Americans would reject the \u201cglobal elite\u201d and support his presidential candidacy. But Trump has broken with Republican Party orthodoxy in criticizing trade deals, and has threatened to slap tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports. His rhetoric has drawn criticism from many economists, who say such practices could spark trade wars. As Trump spoke, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is usually in sync with prominent Republicans on trade policy, said on Twitter: \u201cUnder Trump\u2019s trade plans, we would see higher prices, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy.\u201d ",

        "text": "BOSTON (Reuters) - The Washington Post on Wednesday called on Maine Governor Paul LePage to resign, following a series of incidents in which the two-term Republican made racially charged statements and threatened a Democratic lawmaker in an obscenity-laden email. LePage, whose term extends through 2018, last month lashed out at a state lawmaker who criticized his comments blaming black and Hispanic people from out of state for the heroin trade in Maine. In an editorial titled \u201cMaine\u2019s unhinged governor,\u201d the newspaper wrote \u201cLePage threatens to remake his state\u2019s image from a vacation paradise of surreal natural beauty to a hotbed of hatred.\u201d LePage had told reporters he had collected a three-ring binder of people arrested for trafficking drugs in the state and that 90 percent of those in it were black or Hispanic. The governor released the binder this week and a review by local media found that closer to one in three arrestees in it matched LePage\u2019s description. Maine legislative leaders last month briefly considered convening a special session to reprimand LePage for the outburst, but the effort collapsed with the two parties unable to agree on whether they wanted to censure him or pursue impeachment. A spokeswoman for the governor dismissed the editorial as biased. \u201cThe Post did not contact anyone from the governor\u2019s office to fact-check this biased piece of propaganda,\u201d spokeswoman Adrienne Bennett said in an email. \u201cClearly, the Post editorial board is exempt from reporting facts.\u201d Asked about what factual inaccuracies in the editorial concerned the governor, Bennett challenged the Post\u2019s description of LePage declining to attend a 2011 Martin Luther King Jr. Day event hosted by the state\u2019s NAACP chapter, noting that he had instead attended a Rotary Club event honoring the slain civil rights activist. At the time that he declined the NAACP\u2019s invitation, in his first month as governor, LePage said that critics of his decision could \u201ckiss my butt.\u201d ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday increased pressure on the Pentagon and the Air Force, demanding answers over the continued use of Russian rocket engines for U.S. satellite launches. Senator John McCain, in a letter dated Feb. 10 seen by Reuters, asked Air Force Secretary Deborah James and Pentagon chief arms buyer Frank Kendall to explain why the U.S. government is continuing to deal with NPO Energomash, the Russian firm that builds Russian RD-180 rocket engines.  McCain pressed the officials on the legality of doing business with NPO Energomash given sanctions in place against Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and others, who now have control over the company after a recent reorganization.      McCain also questioned the Air Force\u2019s continued payment of a large launch support contract to United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, despite the presence of a certified competitor, Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX. McCain said he wants answers to these questions by February 22.  James pledged to respond to the questions during a January hearing, but McCain said he followed up in writing to underscore his concerns about what he has described as subsidies to Russian leader \u201cVladimir Putin and his gang of corrupt cronies.\u201d Congress banned use of the Russian RD-180 rocket engines for military use after Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region in 2014. But U.S. lawmakers weakened the ban late last year, worried that it could drive ULA out of business and leave just privately-held SpaceX, to lift satellites into space. James and other officials have urged Congress to allow use of the Russian engines that power ULA\u2019s Atlas 5 rocket for several years until alternatives are available in several years.  In his letter, McCain asked the U.S. and Air Force to explain what options they had to penalize ULA for not bidding in a recent launch competition despite receiving launch support of $800 million to $1 billion a year since 2006. He also asked the department to examine what percentage of that annual support contract was associated with ULA\u2019s other family of rockets, the Delta 4, which the company plans to retire since it is more costly than the Atlas 5. McCain and other senators argue that it would be worth the extra cost to end U.S. reliance on the Russian engines.     ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Classical crossover singer Jackie Evancho, who charmed TV audiences as a child on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d six years ago, will sing the U.S. national anthem at the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump - the first performer to be announced for the ceremony. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee made the announcement on Wednesday, saying Evancho, 16, \u201crepresents the best and the brightest of America.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so excited. It\u2019s going to be awesome,\u201d Evancho said on the \u201cToday\u201d show on Wednesday. Celebrity news website TMZ reported on Wednesday that Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli would also be singing at the Jan. 20 ceremony, but there was no official confirmation. As a tiny 10-year-old, Evancho wowed Americans with her soaring soprano on classical arias like Puccini\u2019s \u201cO mio babbino caro,\u201d taking second place on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d She will follow in the footsteps of Aretha Franklin and Beyonce, who performed the \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at President Barack Obama\u2019s two inaugurations. After her \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d run, Evancho became the youngest solo artist to have a platinum-selling album in the United States. She met Trump at that time and has a photo on her Facebook page of the two of them standing together. The inaugural committee has said it has \u201cworld-class talent\u201d offering their services for the ceremony, but Evancho is the first celebrity to be announced. The inaugural committee\u2019s chairman, Tom Barrack, quashed speculation on Tuesday that rapper Kanye West, who had a surprise meeting that day with the Republican president-elect at Trump Tower in New York, would be performing. Country singer Garth Brooks is in discussions to perform, and, according to celebrity media, other names thought to be in talks include Kid Rock, rocker Ted Nugent and country star Lee Greenwood.  Beyonce, Katy Perry, Bruce Springsteen and many other leading music stars backed Democrat Hillary Clinton in the election, and Elton John last month denied a report that he would be playing for Trump.

        "text": "LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenia s Prime Minister, Miro Cerar, has canceled a visit to Croatia, accusing the neighboring state of reigniting a long-running maritime dispute, his office said on Friday. Cerar called off next week s trip after his Croatian counterpart, Andrej Plenkovic, told the U.N. General Assembly that an international ruling on their shared waters was invalid. The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in June that Slovenia should have  uninterrupted access  to the sea it shares with Croatia. Croatia objected at the time, and Plenkovic said he had merely repeated his country s position at the United Nations on Thursday.  In my speech there was nothing new about Croatia s position, I mentioned the facts... We remain open for dialogue with Slovenia and I invite Cerar to come to Croatia on some other date,  Plenkovic told a cabinet session in Zagreb. The countries have been arguing over a stretch of their sea and land border since both declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991 as it disintegrated into war and broke up. The dispute, which centers on the bay of Piran, held up Croatian accession to the EU for many years. Only after both parties agreed to arbitration was Zagreb granted entry to the bloc in 2013 - though it later withdrew from the proceedings. The Hague-based court ruled that Slovenia gets the vast majority of the Piran bay area recognized as its territorial waters.  In addition, the tribunal established a 2.5 nautical-mile wide and some 10 nautical-mile long corridor through Croatian waters to give Slovenia much-coveted direct access to international waters. ",

        "text": "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand will partially ease fuel rationing on Thursday night, a spokesman for the country s oil industry said, a sign that the five-day long fuel shortage that has caused air travel disruptions is subsiding.  More than 120 flights have been cancelled this week in New Zealand s largest city, Auckland, disrupting thousands of travellers each day, after the single privately owned pipeline that carries jet fuel from a refinery to the city s airport was damaged. National carrier Air New Zealand said it expected flights to run as usual on Friday, with no cancellations for the first time since Sunday. Airline fuel allocations will rise to 50 percent, from 30 percent, at midnight on Thursday, said Andrew McNaught, manager for Mobil New Zealand Ltd and a spokesman for the customers of the country s only oil refinery operator Refining NZ. Travel restrictions for government officials have been lifted, said Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Spokeswoman Carolyn Tremain in a statement.  New Zealand s government and oil industry have taken a series of measures to try to contain the crisis, from fuel rationing to calling on the military to help truck in supplies of fuel, and have set up an industry-government group to handle the fallout. A New Zealand navy vessel will ferry diesel fuel around the country as the government rushes to alleviate the shortage in the run-up to Saturday s national election. The ship will transport up to 4.8 million litres of diesel - equivalent to 150 tankers - to enable the oil industry to focus on providing jet fuel to Auckland airport, Energy and Resources Minister Judith Collins said on Thursday.  The government will continue to do everything it can to support industry efforts to address the disruption,  Collins said in statement. The measures are simply a stopgap until the pipe is repaired, which will take place by Sept. 26, McNaught said. The ordeal has become a headache for the ruling National Party which is battling it out with the newly invigorated  Labour Party to form the next government. The latest poll showed the National Party held a near nine-point lead over Labour, but polls have been volatile and at times have shown Labour with a comfortable winning margin. Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern has criticized the government of Prime Minister Bill English for not having taken measures to avoid the kind of infrastructure failure that led to the disruptive fuel shortage. Overnight, Australia s Qantas Airways operated two flights from Australia, nicknamed  fuel mules , carrying fuel to top up Jetstar and Qantas aircraft in Auckland, the airline said. One was a scheduled A330 passenger service that carried an extra 10,000 kilograms of fuel, while the other was a special 747 flight with 65,000 kilograms of fuel aboard, it said.  ",

        "title": "Brazil environmentalist Marina Silva to run for president in 2018",
        "text": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Former Brazilian senator and environmental minister Marina Silva said on Saturday that she would seek her party s nomination to run for president next year.  Silva announced her plans at a meeting of her Sustainability Network Party, or REDE, which would officially nominate her at its national convention in April. The 59-year-old environmentalist, born into a rubber-tapping community in the Amazon rainforest, was minister under former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. She has run in the previous two presidential elections but never made it to a second-round vote.  Silva said she would seek her party s nomination because  Brazilians want a country free of corruption  and that she had the ethical bearings to deliver on that.  Supporters have praised her as Brazil s most principled politician, which could play a large role in the next election. Since early 2014, Brazilian prosecutors and police have carried out an unprecedented anti-corruption drive that has revealed political graft touching every major party, but not Silva s. Silva has remained committed to fiscal responsibility, inflation targeting and a floating exchange rate, the so-called tripod of economic policies that gave Brazil stability after a period of rampant inflation and erratic growth in the 1990s.   In the latest election survey conducted by the respected Datafolha polling institute and published Saturday on the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper s website, Silva ranked third, with 10 percent of respondents saying they would vote for her.  But that poll included Lula as a possible candidate.  Lula was convicted in a corruption trial in July. If a higher court upholds that conviction before the October election, he could not run.  Without Lula, the Datafolha poll had Silva trailing right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro, a federal lawmaker who won 21 percent approval, compared with her 16 percent. Datafolha interviewed 2,765 voters across Brazil on Nov. 29-30. The poll had a two-percentage-point margin of error.  In the 2010 election, Silva, then with the Green Party, took a surprising 20 percent of the first-round vote, but it was not enough to push her into a runoff with eventual winner Dilma Rousseff.  In 2014, she ran for vice president on the Brazilian Socialist Party ticket headed by Eduardo Campos, who died when his campaign plane crashed just two months before the election. Silva took his spot and won 21 percent in the first round, again missing out on a runoff.  ",

        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who leads the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party, is the front-runner ahead of next year s presidential election, according to a newspaper poll published on Monday.  The El Universal survey found that 23.3 percent of respondents would vote for MORENA in the 2018 vote, ahead of the conservative National Action Party, which had 20 percent support.  President Enrique Pena Nieto s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) was in third place, with 16.5 percent, the poll found. The major parties have yet to pick their candidates for the race, but Lopez Obrador, or AMLO as he is known locally, is the de facto candidate of MORENA, which he founded in 2014 after breaking with his longtime base, the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). A victory for the combative and nationalist-leaning Lopez Obrador could stoke tensions with the Trump administration just as the United States, Mexico and Canada seek to seal a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The silver-haired Lopez Obrador, 63, is one of the best-known politicians in Mexico, having spent years relentlessly attacking other parties for corruption. But he is also a divisive figure, feared by the country s business elite. A former mayor of Mexico City, Lopez Obrador finished runner-up in the last two presidential contests.   In various scenarios polled by El Universal, in which AMLO faced different candidates from the other parties, the leftist came out ahead, garnering between 28.6 and 31 percent support. Political analysts say that may be enough to win the July 2018 contest with the electorate increasingly divided. Only the PAN s Margarita Zavala, who is the wife of former President Felipe Calderon, came close, with 26.1-26.6 percent of respondents giving her their support.  Additionally, AMLO was the most positively viewed potential candidate, with 43.3 percent of those polled holding an upbeat view of the veteran politician.  An electoral pact linking the PAN, the PRD and the Citizen s Movement party is not well known in Mexico, the poll found, but among those with knowledge of the newly formed alliance, 46 percent thought it could beat MORENA next year.  The survey, which had a margin of error of 1.3 percent, polled 6,400 Mexicans in face-to-face interviews between Aug. 18 and Sept. 3. ",

        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Wearing black clothing and skeletal face paint, dozens of women marched in downtown Mexico City on Wednesday to commemorate the growing number of women murdered and pressure the government to put an end to what they say is the rampant impunity fueling it. About 200 protesters held photos of murdered sisters, daughters and friends while chanting  not one more  in a procession that was a somber contrast to festive events elsewhere in the capital on the eve of Day of the Dead. Homicides of women have risen by nearly a quarter on average under President Enrique Pena Nieto compared with the previous administration, and Mexico s total murder tally is on track to hit the highest level in its modern history this year.  As women we face a lot of danger,  said Claudia Correa, whose 21 year-old daughter, was found dead near her home in Veracruz state last month with stab wounds in the chest and neck, after speaking one evening with her ex-boyfriend. Correa said the ex-boyfriend has since disappeared, and an investigation is underway to find him.  The authorities don t do anything to find these killers and the killers realize that they are taking so long that they have a chance to get away. And they are going to continue doing so if we allow them to,  said Correa, donning a photo of her deceased daughter with the caption  Justice .  The march, planned by about 50 activists, was scheduled to be mirrored on Wednesday evening in several states that have registered high levels of violence against women.  Each case is a tale of horror,  said organizer Ana Elena Contreras, who is pushing the government to do more to end the murder, rape and abuse of women, in a country where thousands of violent crimes go unpunished every year. Contreras said as long as perpetrators are not brought to book, women will continue to face grave risks in Mexico, which scored worse than the most violent countries of Central America in the 2017 Global Impunity Index, published in August. That included Honduras and El Salvador, which have been two of the most murderous countries in the world in the past decade. The problem of violence against women has become so serious in Mexico that the federal penal code now defines certain types of murders as  femicide . Still, measuring the phenomenon of femicides is difficult due to a lack of specific data, said Francisco Rivas, director general of the National Citizen Observatory (ONC), a civil group monitoring justice and security in Mexico.   There s a part of society that still doesn t consider this issue as something serious; they minimize it,  said Rivas. In the first four years of Pena Nieto s government, Mexico registered some 2,543 homicides of women on average, up from  2,051 in the term of his predecessor Felipe Calderon, according to data published by Mexico s national statistics agency. The 2,735 homicides of women last year was the second-highest figure of any year since 1990, and more than double the number recorded a decade ago. ",

        "text": "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand will develop a close relationship with China, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said on Tuesday, putting to rest fears that his protectionist campaign rhetoric would fuel tension with a key trading partner. The 40-year political veteran played a decisive role in bringing the centre-left Labour Party to power in October after an inconclusive election left his nationalist New Zealand First party holding the balance of power. But many in China see New Zealand as a model for the Asian giant s relationship with Western countries, with President Xi Jinping last year calling the depth of the bond  unprecedented .  Our record of trade and economic firsts is dramatic,  Peters, who is also deputy prime minister, told academics and diplomats in Wellington, setting out his stance on China for the first time since taking office.  New Zealand will continue to seek closer cooperation with China as both countries focus on sustainable economic development and the wellbeing of our peoples,  Peters said, giving a complimentary account of 45 years of diplomatic ties.    Peters had campaigned on a protectionist platform, vowing to slash immigration and curb foreign investment, which fueled  concern he could anger the Asian giant, the country s top destination for goods exports. On the previous National government s watch, New Zealand became the first developed country to join the China-led Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank and helped usher in other Western countries, according to treasury officials. Trade between the two countries has grown to more than NZ$24 billion ($16.54 billion) a year and New Zealand was the first Western nation to formally sign up to China s sweeping Belt and Road global infrastructure initiative in March. The two are in the midst of negotiations to upgrade their 2008 free trade pact, which Peters said would  serve as a demonstration to our shared commitment to trade liberalization . He also defended China s human rights record, which has at times drawn fire from rights groups.  When you have hundreds of millions of people to be re-employed and relocated with the change of your economic structure you have some massive, huge problems,  Peters said.  Sometimes commentators in the West should have a little more regard to that, and the economic outcome for those people, rather than constantly harping on about the romance of freedom.  China s crackdown on activists and lawyers in its campaign to stifle dissent was  alarming , New York-based Human Rights Watch said in September. ($1=1.4512 New Zealand dollars) ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Oklahoma voting officials have denied a request from the Russian consulate in Houston to monitor the Nov. 8 general elections in the state, saying foreign delegates are not allowed into polling stations, an official said on Friday. The move comes as the U.S. government this month formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations to interfere with the U.S. election process. The consul general made similar requests to officials in Texas and Louisiana, local news reports said, and was rebuffed in both states. The Consulate General of the Russian Federation in Houston was not immediately available for comment.  The consulate asked to have personnel in Oklahoma to study the Nov. 8 presidential election and was told that state law forbids anyone other than election officials and voters into areas where votes are being cast, said Bryan Dean, spokesman for the Oklahoma State Election Board.

        "text": "MANILA (Reuters) - Ride-hailing platforms Uber [UBER.UL] and Grab have agreed to stop their drivers from delivering unchecked packages on behalf of customers, in response to government concerns they could unwittingly become couriers of illegal drugs. The decision followed an advisory from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) about some illicit drugs in packages reportedly being delivered via the ride-hailing services. President Rodrigo Duterte s 15-month-old administration has been waging a brutal war on drugs, the centerpiece of his election campaign, with thousands of people killed during what police say are anti-narcotics operations. Duterte insists narcotics are at the root of the country s rampant crime problem and says as many as four million Filipinos are using drugs. Uber and Grab representatives who met this week with officials of PDEA and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said they would order drivers not to take unchecked packages without passengers.  Uber services here are for passengers only,  Yves Gonzales, in charge of government relations and public policy at Uber Philippines, said during the meeting, in comments aired on news channel ANC on Friday. Leo Gonzales, Grab Philippines public affairs head, sought an assurance that Grab drivers would not be penalized by the regulator for refusing customers who wanted packages to be delivered. Its delivery service, Grab Express, would require customers to open the packages and show the contents to drivers first, then complete identification forms, ANC reported. The LTFRB said in a statement it would make drug testing mandatory for all drivers of public utility vehicles and ride-hailing services, and would ban those showing positive results. Representatives of Uber and Grab did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ",

        "title": "Funding battle begins with House bill on regulators, agencies",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The first shots in a political battle over funding for a range of federal activities rang out during a congressional subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, as Republicans and Democrats took opposing stances on a budget bill for financial regulators and other agencies. The legislation, which covers funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Treasury Department, the judiciary branch and others, passed the House of Representatives Financial Services Subcommittee and now goes to the full Appropriations Committee. It then must win approval from the Republican-dominated House before being reconciled with a Senate version into a single bill for President Barack Obama to sign. Democrats at Wednesday\u2019s meeting made it clear they will press for changes at every step of the lawmaking process, saying the current bill is loaded with ideological policy \u201criders\u201d that do not belong and that it could cripple important government work. Republicans, meanwhile, said the bill would reign in spending, make bodies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau more accountable and boost funding for important issues. \u201cWe cut funding for nearly two dozen agencies that can operate with a little less,\u201d said Republican Ander Crenshaw of Florida, the subcommittee chairman, adding that the cuts helped free up more money for antidrug trafficking efforts, the Small Business Administration, and the Treasury Department\u2019s Offfice of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. In total, the bill drops funding by 6.5 percent from current levels for all agencies, including the General Services Administration and the Internal Revenue Service, which bear \u201cthe brunt of the reduction\u201d because \u201cthey are the largest agencies in the bill and both have a recent history of inappropriate behavior,\u201d Crenshaw said. Republicans want to shake up the IRS after a 2013 scandal in which it allegedly targeted conservative Tea Party groups. The bill would also shave $50 million from the SEC\u2019s budget. Representative Nita Lowey, a Democrat from New York, said the lower funding in the legislation \u201cwould allow more tax cheats to go undetected\u201d and thwart the SEC in protecting investors.  \u201cThe long list of riders turns a bad bill into an example of the Republican majority\u2019s unnecessary culture war,\u201d she added, citing provisions to block the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s internet neutrality rule and to limit health coverage of abortions for federal employees. Calling the riders \u201cunnecessary, unwarranted, and unhelpful,\u201d  the senior Democrat on the subcommittee, Jose Serrano of New York, said \u201cthey are an effort to appease the right wing of the right wing.\u201d\u00a0  ",

        "title": "Prosecutors will not pursue Bridgegate charges against New Jersey governor",
        "text": "(Reuters) - New Jersey prosecutors on Friday said they would not pursue criminal misconduct charges against Governor Chris Christie in connection with the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal. The Office of the Bergen County Prosecutor said in a letter to a local judge it did not have sufficient evidence to prove allegations that Christie knew about a plot to close lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013 in order to punish a local mayor for failing to endorse Christie\u2019s re-election bid. \u201cThe reason is simple, but compelling - that charge cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d the letter said. Bill Brennan, a retired firefighter and activist who announced he would run for governor this year, filed the citizen complaint against Christie last September. Two former Christie allies were convicted last year of orchestrating the lane closure plot, and U.S. prosecutors introduced evidence at trial suggesting the governor was at least aware of the scheme. Christie has steadfastly denied that he knew about the closures at the time. Roy McGeady, a municipal judge in Fort Lee, had found probable cause to allow the case against Christie to proceed after a hearing at which Brennan testified. Christie\u2019s lawyer was not permitted to argue or cross-examine, McGeady said, because the governor was not a defendant until probable cause was established. Bergen County Superior Court Judge Bonnie Mizdol rejected Christie\u2019s subsequent request to toss the complaint outright. But she agreed with both Christie\u2019s lawyers and county prosecutors that McGeady erroneously denied the governor\u2019s attorney an opportunity to participate. The Bergen County Prosecutor\u2019s Office said in the letter that citizen complaints typically allege minor crimes of which the complainant has personal knowledge. The letter said criminal misconduct was far outside that scope. \u201cIn short, a matter of this gravity should not have been heard by a municipal court judge,\u201d the letter said. Brian Murray, a spokesman for Christie, applauded the decision on Friday. \u201cThe Governor is gratified that the Bergen County Prosecutor\u2019s Office has ended this baseless fiasco began by Mr. Brennan and perpetuated by Judge McGeady,\u201d Murray said in a statement. \u201cIt is right and appropriate that this injustice against the Governor is finally over.\u201d ",

        "title": "Euro budget, ESM, banking union stances unresolved in German talks: document",
        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German parties exploring a coalition government remain divided on the issues of a euro zone budget, Europe s banking union and its ESM bailout fund ahead of a meeting of party leaders later on Friday, according to a draft paper on Europe seen by Reuters. The 1-1/2 page document, a blueprint for a new German government s stance on European issues, contains several bracketed sentences, reflecting ongoing areas of disagreement that must be resolved by Chancellor Angela Merkel and other party leaders at their meeting this afternoon.  We reject [a separate euro zone budget as well as] the introduction of instruments that would lead to automatic transfers or a mutualization of debt,  one passage reads, reflecting differences over whether to rule out French President Emmanuel Macron s idea for such a budget. Macron sent his finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, to Berlin this week to talk with leaders of the German parties and try to persuade them not to reject his ideas for a reform of the euro zone in their coalition agreement. In addition to Merkel s conservatives, the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) are involved in the talks. The FDP has been particularly critical of Macron s ideas for a euro zone budget, fearful this would open the door to Germany subsidizing economically weak members of the 19-nation single currency bloc. The paper, which included footnotes spelling out where the different parties stood on the divisive issues, showed a degree of FDP isolation on key European issues. But in an interview with German magazine Der Spiegel on Friday, FDP leader Christian Lindner signaled a readiness to compromise, notably on Europe s rescue fund, saying a party that won 11 percent of the vote in Germany could not dictate the path for all of Europe. During the German election campaign, the FDP argued that the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) should be wound down, while the other parties argued it should be developed further into a European version of the International Monetary Fund.  The ESM has built up a level of expertise in recent years on the surveillance of stability goals,  Lindner said.  If it stays, it could be an instrument for more discipline.  The paper contained two alternate phrasings on Europe s banking union, one supported by Merkel s conservatives and the Greens, and a second with more hardline language backed by the FDP, according to the footnotes. The first variation talks about the step-by-step completion of the banking union. The second FDP version says the banking union should focus on systemic risks, rather than those to individual banks. The paper also includes passages agreed by all the German parties that will be welcomed by the French. It says Franco-German cooperation is of  particular importance  and acknowledges the need for member states and the EU to have an  appropriate capacity  to invest and counter asymmetric economic shocks.

        "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - A record crowd paid their respects to Japan s 84-year-old Emperor Akihito at Tokyo s Imperial Palace on Saturday, in his first birthday celebration since the date of his abdication was set. The emperor s birthday is traditionally marked by a national holiday and an address at the Imperial Palace, which opens to the public on the day. Well-wishers waved small Japanese flags and held up smartphones as Emperor Akihito, whose position is ceremonial with no political power, addressed them from a balcony, flanked by his wife and other members of the imperial family. The crowd of 52,300, according to the Imperial Household Agency, was the largest birthday attendance during Akihito s symbolic 29-year reign, known as the  Heisei  era, which means  achieving peace  in Japanese.  On this day as we face the cold, my thoughts go out to those who suffered from typhoons and heavy rains, as well as the victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake who continue to lead difficult lives,  he said, referring to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that killed and displaced tens of thousands on the country s eastern seaboard. Along with Empress Michiko, Akihito has spent much of his reign addressing the legacy of World War Two, which was fought in the name of his father, Hirohito, and consoling victims of disasters such as the 2011 earthquake.  Earlier this month, a 10-member Imperial Household Council agreed that Akihito would step down on April 30, 2019, before passing the Chrysanthemum Throne to his eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito. In comments made to media, Akihito said he would use the remaining days of his reign to carry out his duties and prepare to  pass the torch to the next era.  Akihito has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer and said last year that he feared he would struggle to fulfill his royal duties due to his age. Japan passed a law this year allowing him to step down in a one-off provision as existing law did not provide for abdication. The last time a Japanese emperor abdicated was in 1817. Throughout his reign, Akihito has consistently urged the Japanese never to forget the horrors of war. His conciliatory remarks contrast with gestures made by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has adopted a less apologetic tone over Japan s past military aggression. ",

        "title": "Trump says Japan would shoot North Korean missiles 'out of sky' if it bought U.S. weaponry",
        "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Japan would shoot North Korean missiles  out of the sky  if it bought the U.S. weaponry needed for doing so, suggesting Tokyo take a stance it has avoided until now. North Korea is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan. Trump, speaking after a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, repeated his mantra the  era of strategic patience  with North Korea was over, and said the two countries were working to counter the  dangerous aggressions . Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware.  He (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,  Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles.  The prime minister is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment by far.  Abe, for his part, said Tokyo would shoot down missiles  if necessary . Trump was replying to a question that was posed to Abe - namely how he would respond to a quote from Trump from a recent interview in which he said Japan was a  samurai  nation and should have shot down the North Korean missiles. Japan s policy is that it would only shoot down a missile if it were falling on Japanese territory or if it were judged to pose an  existential threat  to Japan because it was aimed at a U.S. target. The U.S. president is on the second day of a 12-day Asian trip that is focusing on North Korea s nuclear missile programs and trade.  Most importantly, we re working to counter the dangerous aggressions of the regime in North Korea,  Trump said, calling  Pyongyang s nuclear tests and recent launches of ballistic missiles over Japan  a threat to the civilized world and to international peace and stability .  Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong. But look what s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now,  he added. North Korea s recent actions have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump s presidency. The U.S. leader, who will visit South Korea on the trip, has rattled some allies with his vow to  totally destroy  North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a  rocket man  on a suicide mission. Abe, with whom Trump has bonded through multiple summits and phone calls, repeated at the same news conference that Japan backed Trump s stance that  all options  are on the table,  saying it was time to exert maximum pressure on North Korea and the two countries were  100 percent  together on the issue. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in  response to Abe s comments, said that the North Korean  situation  was  already extremely complex, sensitive and weak .  We hope that under the present circumstances, all sides  words and actions can help reduce tensions and reestablish mutual trust and getting the North Korean nuclear issue back on the correct track of dialogue and negotiations,  she said. Trump said he was committed to achieving  free, fair, and reciprocal  trade and wants to work with Japan on this issue.  America is also committed to improving our economic relationship with Japan,  Trump said.  As president, I m committed to achieving fair, free, and reciprocal trading relationship. We seek equal and reliable access for American exports to Japan s markets in order to eliminate our chronic trade imbalances and deficits with Japan.  Earlier, speaking to Japanese and U.S. business executives, Trump praised Japan for buying U.S. military hardware. But he added that  many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan . Japan had a $69 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The United States was Japan s second biggest trade partner after China, while Japan was the United States  fourth largest goods export market in 2016. Japanese officials have countered U.S. trade complaints by noting Tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the U.S. deficit than in the past, while China s imbalance is bigger. In a second round of economic talks in Washington last month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, who doubles as deputy premier, failed to bridge differences on trade issues. The two sides are at odds over how to frame future trade talks, with Tokyo pushing back against U.S. calls to discuss a bilateral free trade agreement. Trump also said earlier that an Indo-Pacific trade framework would produce more in trade that the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact pushed by his predecessor but which he announced Washington would abandon soon after he took office. The 11 remaining nations in the TPP, to which Japan s Abe is firmly committed, are edging closer to sealing a comprehensive free trade pact without the United States. Trump met Emperor Akihito, exchanging a handshake and nodding, before his lunch and talks with Abe. He also met relatives of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago to help train spies, calling the kidnappings a  tremendous disgrace  and pledging to work with Abe to bring the victims  back to Japan where they want to be .  I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong Un would send them back,  Trump said.  If he would send them back, that would be the start of something, something very special.    Abe has made resolving the emotive abductions issue a keystone of his career. The families hope their talks with Trump - the third U.S. president they have met - will somehow contribute to a breakthrough, although experts say progress is unlikely. Abe also expressed his condolences for the victims of a gunman who massacred at least 26 worshippers at a church in Texas. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump had no plans to change the schedule for his 12-day Asian trip, which will also take him to Seoul, Beijing and Danang, Vietnam.

        "title": "Merkel says not weakened in coalition talks by state-level defeat",
        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday dismissed the idea that her Christian Democrats  (CDU) defeat in a regional election had made her already tricky job of forming a three-way national coalition even harder. It was sufficiently hard enough anyway, she said. Still reeling from their worst national result since 1949 in September s national election, Merkel s conservatives slumped to 33.6 percent in the northern state of Lower Saxony, their poorest showing in the rich agricultural province in nearly six decades.  I don t see the Lower Saxony election result as weakening us in this (coalition) task,  Merkel said, adding that regional issues had played a big role in the campaign there. The Social Democrats (SPD) won the vote in Lower Saxony - home to carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), which is enmeshed in a diesel emissions scandal - with 36.9 percent, despite lagging far behind the conservatives when campaigning began in August. Education was one of the key campaign topics. Three weeks after her poor national showing, Merkel is about to begin what look set to be thorny coalition discussions with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens on forming a  Jamaica  alliance - so named because the parties  colors correspond with those of the Jamaican flag. Merkel said her conservative bloc was heading into the talks knowing it was the strongest of the three groups, while acknowledging negotiations would be challenging.  We ll have sufficient conflicts anyway. No one is under any illusions about that,  Merkel said. Policy areas over which the three parties are expected to clash include migration, climate and the euro zone. Greens co-leader Simone Peter said the talks would be tough due to the parties  vastly diverging programs, adding:  We must now pull ourselves together and see if coalition negotiations are possible or not.  The conservatives will meet the FDP and Greens separately on Wednesday and then hold three-way discussions on Friday. Merkel said she expected the exploratory talks - an initial stage during which parties decide whether to go ahead with full-blown coalition negotiations - to last several weeks because the  Jamaica  alliance,  untested at the national level, was  an extraordinary political constellation . Horst Seehofer, head of the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the CDU s Bavarian sister party - said the time before Christmas needed to be used to form a stable government but his colleague Alexander Dobrindt was skeptical:  Whether it succeeds, whether a government is formed, is yet to be seen,  he said. Carsten Nickel, deputy research director at Teneo Intelligence, said the weak CDU result would particularly worry the CSU, which faces a regional election next year.  The CSU will fear that Lower Saxony demonstrates that the popular backlash against Merkel s choices in the 2015 migration crisis is not yet over,  he said, referring to her decision to operate an open-borders policy that allowed more than a million migrants to enter Germany. After the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) took almost a million voters from the conservative bloc in September s national election, the sister conservative parties put a long-running internal dispute to bed by agreeing to limit numbers of migrants coming to Germany.

A report published online by the Irrawaddy magazine on Tuesday had cited an unnamed source  who has close ties with military intelligence  as saying that the two men had passed photographs obtained during their reporting on violence in the western state of Rakhine to the U.N. Asked about the report, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Wednesday:  We can confirm that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo do not work for the United Nations and have not contacted the United Nations regarding the situation in Rakhine State.  Reuters also denied that Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, who have been in detention since Dec. 12, had worked with the U.N. or any other organization.  We reject the assertion that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were working with any organization other than Reuters,  said a spokeswoman for the news agency, when asked about the Irrawaddy report.  They were engaged only in independent, unbiased reporting consistent with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.  A government spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Myanmar authorities have said the two journalists are being investigated over whether they violated the country s colonial-era Official Secrets Act. The act carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. The two journalists had worked on Reuters coverage of the crisis in Rakhine, where an estimated 655,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from a fierce military crackdown on militants. A number of governments and human rights and journalist groups have criticized Myanmar s authorities for holding the pair incommunicado since their arrest, with no access to a lawyer, colleagues and family members.  A senior government spokesman said on Wednesday that the pair were in good health and had been well treated. The authorities have previously said that the arrest of the two men did not represent an attack on press freedom. ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday threw out the conviction of former New York state Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, citing a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that narrowed the conduct that can sustain federal corruption charges. But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said federal prosecutors can retry Skelos and his son, Adam Skelos, for bribery and fraud because the evidence presented at trial was \u201csufficient\u201d to prove their case. The ruling came two months after the court also vacated the bribery conviction of former New York state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, employing similar reasoning. Acting U.S. Attorney in Manhattan Joon Kim said in a statement that his office would pursue a \u201cprompt retrial where we will have another opportunity to present the overwhelming evidence of Dean Skelos and Adam Skelos\u2019 guilt.\u201d Prosecutors previously said they would also retry Silver. Alexandra Shapiro, a lawyer for Skelos, said in an email: \u201cWe believe that as events unfold it is going to become clear that this is a case that never should have been brought.\u201d The back-to-back convictions of Silver and Skelos, the state\u2019s most powerful legislators, in November and December 2015 represented two of the most high-profile victories for former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who made public corruption a major focus during his tenure before he was fired by U.S. President Trump in March. Skelos, 69, a Republican, was sentenced to five years in prison in May 2016, while his son Adam was sentenced to 6-1/2 years. Both were free on bail at the time of Tuesday\u2019s decision. Together with Governor Andrew Cuomo, Skelos and Silver were members of the \u201cthree men in a room\u201d in the state capital of Albany that hold enormous sway over major legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned the corruption conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, finding that routine acts such as setting up meetings or contacting other politicians did not qualify as \u201cofficial acts\u201d under federal bribery statutes. The 2nd Circuit said on Tuesday that the jury instructions at Skelos\u2019 trial, which occurred before the McDonnell decision, were therefore improper, through no fault of the judge or the prosecutors.

        "title": "Trump says he will back away from business to focus on White House",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump vowed on Wednesday to step back from running his global business empire to avoid conflicts of interest but gave few immediate details as concern over his dual role mounts ahead of his Jan. 20 inauguration. Trump, a real estate magnate who owns hotels and golf resorts from Panama to Scotland, said he would spell out at a Dec. 15 news conference how he will separate himself \u201cin total\u201d from his worldwide business holdings, which include a winery, modeling agency and a range of other businesses. After Trump won the Nov. 8 election, his company, the Trump Organization, had said it was looking at new business structures with the goal of transferring control to Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump - three of his adult children who are involved with the company. Trump gave few details in a series of early morning tweets but said that \u201clegal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations\u201d and that his children would attend the news conference. He did not say what the planned change might mean for ownership of his businesses. Although Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans generally take a more laissez faire stance toward business than Democrats, the president-elect will travel to Indiana on Thursday to formally announce a deal he reached with United Technologies Corp to keep close to 1,000 jobs at its Carrier Corp air conditioner plant in Indianapolis rather than have them moved to Mexico. Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, railed against Carrier on the campaign trail, using the company\u2019s outsourcing move as an example of how trade agreements hurt American workers.     Critics have raised questions about the role of Trump\u2019s children, who are on the executive committee of his White House transition team. His daughter Ivanka joined a telephone call her father had with Argentine President Mauricio Macri earlier this month and attended a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, creating concerns about possible conflicts of interest. A brand name around the globe, Trump previously argued he had no need to separate himself from the Trump Organization, which includes a hotel down the street from the White House, a Manhattan tower where he lives and is running his transition to office, and a New Jersey golf course where he interviewed Cabinet candidates earlier this month. Trump said on Wednesday he was not required by law to alter his relationship with his business, but added: \u201cI feel it is visually important, as president, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.\u201d As the Republican heads toward taking over the White House from Democratic President Barack Obama, scrutiny of potential conflicts has grown. Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill called for hearings on the issue. Rules on conflict of interest for executive branch employees do not apply to the president, but Trump will be bound by bribery laws, disclosure rules and the U.S. Constitution, which bars elected officials from taking gifts from foreign governments. The nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics, a government office that oversees ethics programs for the executive branch, issued a statement saying it applauded Trump\u2019s aims and appearing to suggest that he completely shed his holdings. \u201cDivestiture resolves conflicts of interest in a way that transferring control does not,\u201d it said. Richard Painter, who served as the chief ethics lawyer to former Republican President George W. Bush, concurred.  \u201cHe needs to sell the businesses not just have someone else manage them for him,\u201d Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, said in an emailed comment. Trump, a former reality TV star, has spent much of the past few weeks setting up his Cabinet and interviewing candidates for top jobs in his administration. On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate his chief campaign fundraiser, Steven Mnuchin, to lead the U.S. Treasury. Mnuchin said the administration would make tax reform and trade pact overhauls top priorities as it seeks a sustained pace of 3 percent to 4 percent economic growth. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, also signaled a desire to remove U.S. mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from government ownership, a move that could have wide-ranging ramifications for how Americans pay for their homes, and said banking regulations should be eased to spur lending. Trump named Wilbur Ross, a billionaire known for his investments in distressed industries, as his nominee for commerce secretary. Both nominees will require confirmation by the U.S. Senate. Trump is also considering Goldman Sachs President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn, a former commodities trader, to head his White House budget office or to fill another position, a Trump transition official said. The economic picks were praised by the Business Roundtable, a group that represents America\u2019s largest corporations. But U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren called Mnuchin \u201cjust another Wall Street insider.\u201d \u201cThat is not the type of change that Donald Trump promised to bring to Washington - that is hypocrisy at its worst,\u201d Sanders, a Vermont independent who ran for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, and Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a joint statement. Trump pledged during his campaign to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington. A spokesman said giving top economic jobs to Wall Street figures was not inconsistent with that vow. \u201cYou want some people that are insiders and understand the system and some outsiders that are creative thinkers, out-of-the-box thinkers and disruptors,\u201d said Anthony Scaramucci, an asset manager who is on Trump\u2019s transition committee. Trump is also working to fill out his foreign policy team, but no decision appeared imminent on who the next secretary of state would be. ",

        "title": "Republican, Democratic senators seek answers in Wells auto scandal",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. senators from both parties on Wednesday turned up the heat on Wells Fargo Inc. over its latest scandal, in which hundreds of thousands of car-loan borrowers were charged each month without their knowledge for collision insurance, which many of them did not need. The Republican chairs of the committee and the subcommittee that would head any congressional investigations into insurance sales, Senators John Thune and Jerry Moran, along with those panels\u2019 senior Democrats, Senators Bill Nelson and Richard Blumenthal, wrote to Wells CEO Timothy Sloan with questions about the scandal as basic as how many customers were affected. They also requested copies of the bank\u2019s internal report that first identified the problem. The group sent similar questions to Barry Karfunkel, CEO of National General Holdings Corporation, which provided the insurance. Last week Moran said he was seeking additional information from Wells about reports the bank charged 800,000 borrowers for insurance without their knowledge or consent, but did not give specifics. Many borrowers already had cheaper insurance with other companies. The letter asks Sloan when the bank, which paid $190 million in fines and penalties last year over creating phantom bank accounts, first learned about the insurance sales practices and also what steps it is taking to prevent a recurrence and to refund the erroneous charges to customers. The letters do not mention possible hearings or subpoenas, but the senators have the authority launch an investigation using both if they are not satisfied with responses to their letters. Wells and National have until Aug. 23 to answer the questions. The Wells letter shows senators are concerned with reports that thousands of borrowers fell into delinquency because they could not afford the premiums on top of their monthly payments and the possibility bank management pushed employees to sign customers up for insurance with incentives or special benefits.  Incentives are at the heart of last year\u2019s scandal, where employees said they created accounts in customers\u2019 names or pushed account holders to buy additional products they did not need in order to meet high sales targets. The senators are also seeking information about possible commissions paid or revenues shared between Wells and National. Wells spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn said the bank is committed to addressing the lawmakers\u2019 concerns.  \u201cCustomer harm is not acceptable at Wells Fargo,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are committed to fixing these mistakes and earning back trust.\u201d ",

        "title": "Australia MPs rush to disclose parentage amid citizenship crisis",
        "text": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Several lawmakers filed family history documents in Australia s parliament to meet a government deadline on Tuesday to try to prove their citizenship and stem a crisis that has so far claimed nine MPs and cost the government its majority.     Australia s 116-year-old constitution bans dual citizens from holding national office and the High Court adopted a strict interpretation of it in October in a country where half the population were either born overseas or have a parent who was. The crisis may yet plunge Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull s Liberal-National coalition into minority rule, should it lose another lawmaker, or a crucial by-election set for Dec. 19.      The ruling center-right pairing lost its one-seat lower-house majority when the High Court found Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce to be a New Zealander and therefore ineligible for office. He has since rescinded his New Zealand citizenship and regained his seat in parliament.   But another member has since quit his place and now as many as a dozen more now face referral to the court after the deadline to disclose the birthplace of parents and grandparents passed on Tuesday. The disclosures show that nearly every lawmaker has at least one foreign parent or grandparent. While some provide citizenship records dating back to the 19th century, others give few details or documents, prompting calls for the High Court to consider their cases.      There are a few grey areas, there s no doubt about that,  MP Christopher Pyne said on Perth radio station 6PR, adding that parliament would decide on Thursday which cases to send to the court. One opposition Labor Party member has already told parliament it  remains unclear  whether he is British, after the Home Office could not find the paperwork to prove he renounced his citizenship a decade ago. Labor argues that seven government lawmakers filed  unconvincing  or  incomplete  disclosures, while the government raised doubts over four opposition MPs, and there is a cloud over another independent lawmaker. Although Joyce easily regained his seat at a by-election on Saturday, the crisis still has the government precariously clinging to power and has already dented its ability to pursue its political agenda. If it loses a by-election in Sydney on Dec. 19, or the court ousts another lower-house MP, it would be forced to depend on a handful of independent lawmakers to retain power and pass laws. ",

        "title": "Illinois lawmakers delay bill to expand abortion as veto looms",
        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers in Illinois on Thursday said they have placed on hold a bill that expands state-funded coverage of abortions for low-income residents and state employees but faces a likely veto from the state\u2019s Republican governor.  The bill, which received final passage in a 33-22 state Senate vote on Wednesday, also aims to keep abortions legal in Illinois if the U.S. Supreme Court follows President Donald Trump\u2019s call to overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that made abortions legal 44 years ago.  Democratic state Senator Don Harmon filed a motion Wednesday night to reconsider the Senate\u2019s vote, meaning the bill will not immediately be sent to Governor Bruce Rauner.  \u201cThis measure is too important to immediately put it in the hands of a governor whose public opinions about women\u2019s access to safe, affordable reproductive health care have been inconsistent at best,\u201d Harmon said in a statement on Thursday. The Senate can hold the bill for the duration of the legislative session, said Harmon spokeswoman Jayette Bolinski.   Illinois\u2019 Medicaid program covers abortions in cases of rape, incest and when a mother\u2019s life or health is threatened. The expansion would enable poor women to obtain elective abortions. Also, the legislation would allow state employees to have the procedures covered under state health insurance. A spokeswoman for Rauner declined to comment on Thursday. Rauner, who faces re-election next year, has promised to veto the legislation, saying Illinois should focus on less \u201cdivisive\u201d issues and instead pass a full-year operating budget for the first time in nearly two years. A veto would be a sharp turn from his previous position, which political opponents are poised to exploit. As a candidate in 2014, he supported expanding abortion access.  Illinois, the country\u2019s fifth-largest state, is immersed in one of the most politically turbulent eras in its 199-year history. Rauner has feuded with Democrats, who control the state legislature, over his insistence a state budget be tied to his list of policy demands that would weaken unions, impose legislative term limits, freeze property taxes and impose new rules on injured workers seeking compensation from their employers.  With House Speaker Michael Madigan and fellow Democrats blocking that agenda, Illinois has been without a complete budget during Rauner\u2019s first two years in office. The fiscal futility has left Illinois - the only state ever to go 22 months without a budget - with around $12.2 billion in unpaid bills as of Wednesday. ",

        "title": "Dublin rejects British proposal for post-Brexit Irish border",
        "text": "TALLINN (Reuters) - Ireland dismissed British proposals for the Irish border after Brexit as unconvincing on Friday, a day after the EU chief negotiator said they amounted to a demand the bloc suspend its laws for Britain. But British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, speaking at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Tallinn, said a solution was  not beyond the wit of man . The border between the Irish Republic and the British province of Northern Ireland is currently open to free flow of goods, being an internal EU frontier. But when Britain leaves the bloc, it will become subject to EU customs regulation.  Establishment of a physical border could revive security concerns, 20 years after a peace deal involving Dublin that ended a long civil conflict in Northern Ireland and led to the end of army and police checkpoints.     Britain has proposed an  invisible border  without border posts or immigration checks between the two after Brexit, but given no firm proposals how the customs frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic would be monitored. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday British proposals would undermine the bloc s single market. He said Britain in effect wanted the EU to  suspend the application of its laws  as a test case for broader EU-British customs regulations.  This will not happen.  Ireland s Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Reuters on Friday:  The maintenance of an invisible border on the island of Ireland would be a lot easier if Britain were to remain in the customs union.  That is something Prime Minister Theresa May has said would not happen, though her cabinet is split on the issue and some have floated the idea of a transition period after Brexit that would still leave Britain in the EU customs union.  Britain is the one leaving, they have an obligation to try and design unique solutions.... We cannot have a physical border on the island of Ireland again that creates barriers between communities,  Coveney said.  We cannot and will not support that and nor will the European Union,  he said, adding that Britons wanted to avoid a hard border too.  The problem is that the solutions to actually get us there so far haven t been convincing.  Negotiations to extricate Britain from the EU have seen a slow start and Brussels has repeatedly warned that time is running out to answer complex questions before Britain is due to leave in March, 2019. The bloc, which will have 27 member states after Brexit, wants to solve key exit issues before opening talks about any future trade cooperation with Britain. London says divorce talks should run in parallel with discussions about future ties.  But, with slow progress on agreeing Britain s divorce bill, ensuring expatriates  rights and deciding on the Irish border, the EU now doubts it will give a green light in October for starting talks about the post-Brexit order, as had been planned.  The EU worries London may try to use the Irish border as a template for a broader trade pact with the EU after Brexit. It believes Britain s proposals risk affecting the bloc s single market and customs union. The European Parliament s chief Brexit speaker, Guy Verhofstadt, dismissed Britain s plans for an  invisible border  as surreal.  We are nowhere on border issues,  one senior EU official said. But, asked if he was confident that Britain would get a deal with the EU, Johnson said in Tallinn:  Absolutely, with rock solid confidence.  He reiterated London s stance that the divorce talks should run together with discussion about the post-Brexit relationship.   Article 50 makes it very clear that the discussion about the exit of a country must be taken in context with discussion of the future arrangements. And that s what we re going to do,  he said. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - About 60 small business owners and a representative from retailer Big Lots will hold meetings with members of Congress this week in an effort to oppose a proposed \u2018border adjustment tax\u2019, organizers said. Retailers led by large stores including Target, Best Buy and Autozone are trying to get Republicans to abandon the tax as a piece of any sweeping tax reform. The measure would impose a tax on imports while favoring domestic production.  The meetings, which will begin on Tuesday and conclude on Thursday, will include lawmakers and staff from several states including Arizona, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania, focusing on districts represented by members who have not taken a position on the tax or sit on the Ways and  Means Committee. They hope to convince them to oppose the tax. The meetings are the latest effort by retailers to lobby lawmakers to not support a tax they say would increase consumer prices for imported goods. U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has remained a driving force behind the border tax proposal, arguing that economic forces will keep the tax from raising consumer prices. The future of the tax remains shaky. President Donald Trump has refused to endorse it and many Republicans in the House and Senate are opposed. Furthermore, the effort to pass tax reform has stalled. Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said on Monday in a briefing with reporters that tax rate cuts remained a priority, a signal that sweeping tax reform could be dropped in favor of just reducing tax levels. But Joshua Baca, a spokesman for the coalition opposing the tax called Americans for Affordable Products, said they will continue to fight against it. \u201cThe fight is not done. The people who control the process are still very much in favor of the border adjustment tax,\u201d Baca said. Emmett Kelly owns a gun store in Conroe, Texas, in the congressional district of Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, an advocate for the tax. Kelly will travel to Washington to argue tax would be devastating for gun retailers, noting that he imports about 80 percent of his inventory. \u201cEverybody that I\u2019ve talked to has shuddered when they heard what this border adjustment tax is going to cost,\u201d he said. Peter Sides, owner of the Robert M. Sides Family Music Centers which has five locations in Pennsylvania and New York, said 95 percent of the instruments and accessories sold in his store are imported. A price increase will hit his more frequent customers hardest - families with children with a budding interest in music.  \u201cIt all adds up \u2013 and it\u2019s not just what happens to us, you\u2019re asking a family to take on the chin a 15-20 percent across-the-board expense increase for anything that\u2019s imported,\u201d Sides said.

        "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Police in northern Japan have found eight men near a boat at a seaside marina who said they were from North Korea, and appear to be fishermen whose vessel ran into trouble, rather than defectors, a police official said on Friday. The incident comes at a time of rising tension over North Korea s nuclear arms and missile programs after President Donald Trump redesignated the isolated nation a state sponsor of terrorism, allowing the United States to levy further sanctions. Japanese police took the men into custody after a resident of Yurihonjo, a city in the prefecture of Akita, told police of the presence of individuals of unknown nationality, the official, Yoshinobu Ito, told Reuters. The men, who said they were North Koreans, appear to be fishermen whose wooden boat, found nearby, had trouble and went adrift, Ito said. Police and authorities were now dealing with the matter, he added. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, asked if the possibility the men were spies had been ruled out, told a news conference authorities were handling the matter carefully. Japan is studying plans to cope with a possible influx of tens of thousands of North Korean evacuees should a military or other crisis break out on the peninsula, as well as how to weed out spies and terrorists among them, a domestic newspaper said. Last week, the Japan Coast Guard rescued three North Korean men on a capsized boat in the Sea of Japan, off central Japan. The men said they were fishermen and were later sent home aboard a North Korean vessel. Twelve more crew went missing. Last week a North Korean soldier dramatically defected to the South after being shot and wounded by his country s military as he made his getaway across the border in the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone between the two countries.

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s main opposition Labour Party must commit to staying in the European Union s single market after Brexit and put an end to Prime Minister Theresa May s  destructive Brexit , several of its lawmakers said on Sunday. At the beginning of the party s annual conference, Labour lawmakers and trade union leaders wrote an open letter to their leader, calling on Jeremy Corbyn to  go further  than his current position to press for being part of the single market during any transition after Britain leaves in March 2019. After months of sticking to a position little different from the governing Conservative Party s pursuit of a clean break with the EU, Labour changed tack last month by saying, if in power, the party would press for full access to the single market during a transition - something that could continue beyond.  We have watched with dismay as the government has used a narrow referendum result to justify an extreme approach to Brexit,  the lawmakers said in a letter published in Britain s Observer newspaper.  So at our conference this week, Labour should commit to staying in the Single Market and Customs Union   ruling out no options for how to achieve this.  Labour s earlier move was aimed at increasing pressure on May, weakened after losing her party s majority in parliament in a June election she did not need to call and struggling to unite her own party over Brexit. But Labour is also keenly aware that many of its supporters, especially in northern and central England, voted for Brexit and want controls on immigration which many blame for stretching public services, such as hospitals and schools. Corbyn, who says he is preparing for government, told the BBC he was listening to those members of the Labour Party who want to keep the closest possible ties with the EU, but he did not say whether he would change the party s policy. Instead, he said he believed a transitional period with full single market access should last for as long as is necessary and offered some support for continued migration. In the letter, Labour lawmakers attacked the Conservative Party s  damaging promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands .  Labour must be clear: migrants are not to blame for falling wages, job insecurity, bad housing and overstretched public services,  the letter said. ",

        "title": "Supreme Court sympathetic to property owner in wetlands dispute",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared likely to rule that property owners can challenge the federal government in court over the need for permits under a national water protection law in a case involving a company\u2019s plans for a Minnesota peat mine. The court heard a one-hour argument in a case balancing property rights and environmental law, in this instance the landmark 1972 U.S. Clean Water Act. A majority of the eight justices appeared sympathetic toward North Dakota-based Hawkes Co Inc, which is fighting an Obama administration finding that its property includes wetlands. The law mandates that property owners get permits in such situations. Whether a particular plot of land falls under the law\u2019s jurisdiction is important to developers and other property owners because such a finding triggers a lengthy and expensive permitting process. Hawkes\u2019 lawyers argued the company should be able to contest whether it even needs to go through the permit process. Liberal and conservative justices alike expressed concern about the current arrangement\u2019s burden on property owners. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts said applicants who disregard a government finding that they need a permit do so at \u201cgreat practical risk.\u201d Liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the process \u201cvery arduous and very expensive.\u201d Liberal Stephen Breyer called the government decision that Hawkes needed a permit \u201cperfectly suited for review in the courts.\u201d Only liberal Elena Kagan expressed support for the government, raising concerns about the impact a ruling favoring property owners would have on actions by other government agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission. Property rights advocates said the permitting process can take two years and cost up to $270,000, with owners facing penalties of up to $37,500 a day for noncompliance. Business groups including the National Association of Home Builders and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 29 states filed court papers opposing the Obama administration in the case. The case follows the justices\u2019 unanimous 2012 ruling that property owners facing enforcement action under the Clean Water Act can ask a court to intervene before being forced to comply or pay financial penalties. The Obama administration last year issued a new regulation defining the scope of federal jurisdiction over bodies of water. A federal appeals court put the rule on hold after it was challenged by 18 states. Only eight justices participated in the case following Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s February death. A ruling is due by the end of June. ",

        "title": "With China in mind, Japan, India agree to deepen defense",
        "text": "GANDHINAGAR, India (Reuters) - The leaders of India and Japan agreed on Thursday to deepen defense ties and push for more cooperation with Australia and the United States, as they seek to counter growing Chinese influence across Asia. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe arrived this week in his counterpart Narendra Modi s home state, skipping the tradition of visiting the capital of New Delhi, for the tenth meeting between two leaders since Modi came to power in 2014. Relations have deepened between Asia s second and third largest economies as Abe and Modi, who enjoy a close personal relationship, increasingly see eye-to-eye to balance China as the dominant Asian power.  Almost everything that takes place during the visit, including economic deals, will in part be done with China in mind,  Eurasia analysts said in a note.   Abe s visit comes days after New Delhi and Beijing agreed to end the longest and most serious military confrontation along their shared and contested border in decades, a dispute that had raised worries of a broader conflict between the Asian giants.  In a lengthy joint statement, India and Japan said deepening security links was paramount. This included collaboration on research into unmanned ground vehicles and robotics and the possibility of joint field exercises between their armies. There was also  renewed momentum  for cooperation with the United States and Australia. Earlier this year, India rejected an Australian request to be included in four-country naval drills for fear of angering Beijing.  Relations between India and Japan are not only a bilateral relationship but have developed into a strategic global partnership,  Abe told reporters in Gandhinagar, the capital of western Gujarat state.  We (India and Japan) will strengthen our collaboration with those countries with whom we share universal values.  Abe flew to Gujarat to lay the foundation stone of a $17 billion bullet train project, India s first, that was made possible by a huge Japanese loan.  Tokyo wants to win other high-speed rail lines India plans to build, to edge out Chinese ambitions to do the same and provide a boost for its high-end manufacturers. The visit was light on specific announcements, but India said it welcomed proposals for increased Japanese investment into infrastructure projects in its remote northeast, a region New Delhi sees as its gateway to Southeast Asia.  China claims part of India s northeast as its own territory. Japanese investment into the northeast  would give legs to our Act East policy,  Indian Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar told reporters. Modi and Abe also said they would push for more progress on the development of industrial corridors for the growth of Asia and Africa.  Analysts say the planned $40 billion Asia-Africa Growth Corridor takes direct aim at China s Belt and Road project, envisaged as a modern-day  Silk Road  connecting China by land and sea across Asia and beyond to the Middle East, Europe and Africa.

        "title": "Republicans offer bill to block potential Iran dollar use",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Republican U.S. senators who oppose the nuclear agreement with Iran introduced a bill on Wednesday that would keep Iran from gaining even indirect access to the U.S. financial system or using U.S. dollars in business transactions. The measure introduced by Senators Mark Kirk and Marco Rubio came amid media reports that U.S. officials were moving toward allowing such transactions. President Barack Obama has denied having such plans. The legislation would prohibit the president from issuing any license for conducting an offshore U.S. dollar clearing system for Iranian transactions or providing any such system with U.S. dollars. It also would impose secondary sanctions on any financial institution found to be participating in any offshore dollar clearing system with Iran. State Department spokesman Mark Toner acknowledged the United States was advising banks and other businesses about how to conduct business with Tehran without running afoul of U.S. authorities, but that does not involve converting money to dollars. \u201cThese banks don\u2019t want to violate existing sanctions,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they are allowed to under certain condition to do business with Iran, so we do consider it as an obligation on how to counsel them.\u201d Along with some of Obama\u2019s fellow Democrats, congressional Republicans unanimously opposed the deal announced in July in which Iran agreed to scale back its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Several lawmakers have been working on legislation since to keep tight controls on Iran, especially over its repeated ballistic missile tests since late last year. U.S. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, published a column in the Washington Post on Wednesday saying Obama was so eager to preserve a signature foreign policy agreement that he would consider measures that would let Iran \u201claunder dollars while the administration looked the other way.\u201d The issue is particularly potent in this U.S. election year, when Americans will pick a new president, and every member of the House and one-third of senators are up for re-election. The three remaining Republican presidential candidates have all vowed to tear up or back away from the nuclear deal, which Obama administration officials say would be calamitous. Rubio suspended his 2016 presidential campaign last month, and Kirk\u2019s Senate re-election race is seen as one of this year\u2019s most competitive. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An effort in the U.S. Senate to expand the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s authority to use a secretive surveillance order has delayed a vote on a popular email privacy bill, casting further doubt on whether the legislation will become law this year. The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday postponed consideration of a measure that would require government authorities to obtain a search warrant before asking technology companies, such as Microsoft  and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google , to hand over old emails. A version of the Senate bill unanimously passed the House last month. Currently, federal agencies do not need a warrant to access emails or other digital communications more than 180 days old due to a provision in a 1986 law that considers them abandoned by the owner.  But Republican party senators offered amendments Thursday that privacy advocates argued contravened the purpose of the underlying bill and would likely sink its chances of becoming law. Those amendments include one by Senator John Cornyn, the second ranking Republican in the Senate, that would broaden the FBI\u2019s authority to deploy an administrative subpoena known as a National Security Letter to include electronic communications transaction records such as the times tamps of emails and their senders and recipients. Senators Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee, the Democratic and Republican authors of the email privacy bill, agreed to postpone the vote to give time to lawmakers to review the amendments and other provisions of the bill that have prompted disagreement.  NSLs do not require a warrant and are almost always accompanied by a gag order preventing the service provider from sharing the request with a targeted user.  The letters have existed since the 1970s, though the scope and frequency of their use expanded greatly after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.  In 2015 requests for customer records via NSLs increased nearly 50 percent to 48,642 requests, up from 33,024 in 2014, according to a U.S. government transparency report. The Obama administration has for years lobbied for a change to how NSLs can be used, after a 2008 legal memo from the Justice Department said the law limits them largely to phone billing records. FBI Director James Comey has said the change needed essentially corrects a typo. The Senate Intelligence Committee this week passed a bill to fund the U.S. intelligence community that contains a similar provision that would allow NSLs to be used to gather email records.  Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, voted against the proposal and said it \u201ctakes a hatchet to important protections for Americans\u2019 liberty.\u201d ",

        "title": "Embattled Australian PM says he will lead government to next election",
        "text": "MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia s embattled conservative Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has shaken off speculation about the security of his leadership, declaring on Sunday he will lead his coalition government into the next election in 2019. Turnbull, who has faced a horror run in recent weeks, losing his one-seat majority and being called to stepdown before Christmas, said that he  runs the government  and that his party s policies would soon be converted into public support.  I have every confidence that I will lead the coalition to the next election in 2019 and we will win it,  Turnbull told Sky News television.  I am very confident we will be able to see a disciplined approach to teamwork within the coalition.     Three Australian prime ministers have been ousted by their own parties since 2010. Turnbull s confidence has been bolstered by the stunning by-election victory of his former deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, who easily cruised to victory on Saturday night with a huge 65 percent primary vote. Barnaby was kicked out of parliament just over one month ago because he held dual citizenship with New Zealand, a status he has since rescinded. Under Australia s constitution dual citizens are banned from the national parliament. Barnaby s win restores Turnbull s slim one-seat majority in parliament and Turnbull, who is struggling with record low opinion polls, has claimed the victory as a vote of confidence in his performance. Turnbull has been under sustained attack for much of the year over issues including same sex marriage and the scandal-plagued banking sector, and has failed to end widespread disquiet within his coalition about his future as leader. On Friday, the conservative deputy premier of New South Wales state John Barilaro called for Turnbull to step down as a  Christmas gift  to the nation. The comment came just days after Turnbull was forced into an embarrassing policy reversal and called a Royal Commission into the country s banking and financial sector amid mounting political pressure. Turnbull has failed to stem a flow of disgruntled voters away from his conservative coalition to far-right parties and the fragility of his government has been exacerbated by a dual citizenship crisis which is forcing a number of lawmakers, like Barnaby, to recontest seats. One of those by-elections for the blue-ribbon conservative electorate of Bennelong in Sydney on Dec. 16 could see Turnbull again lose his majority in parliament if the opposition Labor achieves a surprise win.

        "text": "ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - At least five people were killed in a town in Ethiopia s restive Oromiya region on Thursday after police opened fire during a protest, witnesses said. Protesters had blocked the main road in Ambo, some 130 km (80 miles) west of the capital Addis Ababa, to demonstrate against sugar shortages, before police arrived to disperse the crowd.  They (police) then fired live rounds. We know of ... five people who died from gunshot wounds,  one of the protesters told Reuters. Another witness said he saw up to 10 wounded people taken to hospital. The regional government s spokesman confirmed that deaths had occurred, but did not give details.  Demonstrations happening in Ambo have resulted in death and injuries,  Addisu Arega Kitessa said in a Facebook statement, adding that they were organized by  enemies  of the region. The province was wracked by protests for months in 2015 and 2016. Nearly 700 people were killed last year in one bout of unrest provoked by plans to implement a development scheme for Addis Ababa that opponents said amounted to a land grab, according to a parliament-mandated investigation.  Broader anti-government demonstrations over politics and human rights abuse then followed, forcing the government to impose a nine-month state of emergency that was finally lifted in August.  Separately, ethnic clashes killed at least 11 people this week in the same region. Another bout of violence along Oromiya s border with the country s Somali region last month displaced hundreds of thousands of people. The developments highlight tensions in the country where the government has delivered high economic growth but it often accused of curbing political freedoms. The government denies clamping down on free speech and blames rebel groups and dissidents abroad for stirring up violence. ",

        "title": "Italy's former PM Renzi loses more allies as election nears",
        "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose Democratic Party (PD) is shedding support in opinion polls, suffered a further setback on Wednesday when two allies said they would not contest next year s election. Renzi quit as prime minister a year ago after losing a referendum on his planned constitutional reforms. He aims to return to power at the vote due by May, but the PD has split under his leadership and his prospects seem to be dwindling. On Wednesday Giuliano Pisapia, a former mayor of Milan, announced that his small leftist party, called The Progressive Camp (CP), which had been expected to join forces with the PD at the election, was disbanding. Pisapia said it had proved  impossible to continue talks with the PD , and complained in particular about Renzi s unwillingness to push through a contested law making it easier for the children of immigrants to obtain Italian citizenship. Hours later, Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano, leader of the centrist Popular Alternative party (AP) which governs with the PD, said he would not be running at the election, throwing into doubt the future of the party he founded.  The CP and AP have less than 3 percent of the vote each, according to opinion polls, but the latest defections weaken the center-left in which a declining PD is now virtually without any allies.  The left and the PD are crumbling away,  said Renato Brunetta, lower house leader of Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party which is the lynchpin of a center-right alliance that is expected to win most seats at the election. On Sunday, leftist parties which had already quit the PD joined forces under the leadership of Senate Speaker Piero Grasso to form Free and Equal, a new grouping already credited with around 6 percent of the vote and expected to grow further at the expense of the PD.     Posing a potential further headache for Renzi, a parliamentary commission on banking decided later on Wednesday to call a former top banker who a prominent journalist alleged had been put under pressure by a close ally in his government. In a book published earlier this year, the previous director of one of Italy s biggest newspapers said Renzi s reform minister Maria Elena Boschi had in 2015 asked Federico Ghizzoni, then chief executive of UniCredit, to look into buying a struggling bank where her father held a senior position. The cross-party commission investigating banking crises said in a statement it had voted unanimously to call Ghizzoni to speak. A source said his hearing would be held by Dec. 23. Boschi, who is now cabinet secretary, denies ever asking anyone to buy Banca Etruria, which was eventually rescued by the state. She said this week she was taking legal action.     Renzi s PD critics say he has dragged the traditionally left-leaning party to the right and lament what they say is his autocratic, domineering leadership style.    The party has been steadily losing support since it won over 40 percent of the vote at European elections in 2014. Surveys suggest it would now poll around 25 percent, some 3 points behind the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. The center-right bloc is made up of Forza Italia and the anti-immigrant Northern League, each with around 15 percent, and the right-wing Brothers of Italy, on around 5 percent. While the center-right is seen winning most seats at the election, opinion polls suggest it will not win an absolute majority, making a hung parliament the most likely outcome. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Iraqi forces launched on Thursday an offensive to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, on the border area with Syria, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said.  Daesh members have to choose between death and surrender,  he said in a statement announcing the offensive on region of al-Qaim and Rawa. The Iraqi airforce dropped thousands of leaflets on the border area calling on the militants to surrender and urging the population to stay away from their positions, according to a statement from the Joint Operations Command in Baghdad. The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi ite militias backed by Iran and Russia. Islamic State s self-declared cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group s de facto capital in Iraq, in a grueling battle which lasted nine months. The militants  Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, fell to U.S.-backed forces last week. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared the caliphate from Mosul in mid-2014, released an audio recording on Sept. 28 that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed. He urged his followers to keep up the fight despite setbacks.  Tell those among your children and relatives who took up a weapon against the state to throw it aside immediately, and to go to any house on top of which a white flag have been raised when the liberation forces enter al-Qaim,  said the leaflets dropped by the Iraqi airforce. Regular army units, Sunni tribal forces and Iranian-backed Popular Mobilisation are taking part in the offensive toward the Syrian border, the Joint Operations Command said. ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York\u2019s top Democratic legislator drove home his budget priorities on Friday, touching on the minimum wage, paid family leave and education ahead of the release of the state Assembly\u2019s spending plan scheduled for later that day. Assembly speaker Carl Heastie highlighted the proposals that have become a rallying point for Democrats both in the state and nationally, saying that he was \u201cvery optimistic\u201d an agreement could be reached over a state-wide $15 minimum wage with the Republican controlled Senate. Heastie, speaking at an event in New York City, stressed his support for paid family leave. The Assembly passed a bill in February that would allow workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new child or a sick relative. The initiative is supported by Governor Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat. The speaker highlighted $1.7 billion in higher education spending for the state and city public university systems, including funding a two-year tuition freeze, and a $2.1 bln increase in education funding for the state\u2019s public schools. The Assembly\u2019s school spending proposal is $1.2 billion over  Cuomo\u2019s executive budget.  Confidence in the state capital Albany was shaken last year after the convictions on corruption charges of the speakers of both the Senate and the Assembly. Heastie became speaker after charges were brought against his predecessor Sheldon Silver. Heastie said he will release ethics proposals also on Friday that seek to limit outside pay for legislators, and put conditions on roles legislators can take in the private sector. The Assembly\u2019s budget will be released later on Friday and passed by the Assembly on Monday, Heastie\u2019s spokesperson Mike Whyland said. It follows the release of Cuomo\u2019s $145 billion executive budget in January.  The Senate has also released parts of its one house budget, promising to cut middle class tax rates by 25 percent through 2025, leading to a reduction in the tax burden of $3.5 billion. The three budget plans need to be reconciled by the start of the state\u2019s financial year on April 1. Cuomo has made passing an on-time budget a barometer of good governance and has managed to pass all five of his previous budgets on time. ",

        "title": "Vaccination begins in Bangladesh camps to head off cholera outbreak",
        "text": "COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) began distributing 900,000 doses of cholera vaccine on Tuesday in Bangladesh s camps for Rohingya refugees fleeing from Myanmar, as authorities rush to prevent a major outbreak of the deadly disease. More than 10,000 cases of diarrhea have been reported in the past week alone, the WHO said. Doctors in two clinics have told Reuters that there have been several cases of patients with the symptoms of cholera, a virulent diarrhea that kills within 36 hours if not treated. Cholera has not been identified in testing of patient samples by Bangladesh s health ministry, although clinics say they are waiting for results for some samples sent last week.  There is a clear risk for cholera,  said Dr N. Paranietharan, the WHO s representative in Bangladesh.   Sporadic cases are inevitable (but) we are not expecting a major outbreak like Yemen,  he said. War-torn Yemen is in the grip of a cholera crisis, with more than 750,000 sufferers afflicted by the bacteria, which is spread when contaminated faeces is ingested by humans, usually through the water supply. The cholera vaccination campaign in Bangladesh, the second largest in history, will be crucial to containing any outbreak, said Paranietharan. More than 1,000 people will fan out across the sprawling camps on the southern tip of Bangladesh that are home to more than 519,000 Rohingya Muslims.  The Rohingya fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar when government forces launched a ferocious offensive, denounced by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing, in response to a series of Rohingya militant attacks on security posts on Aug. 25. In pounding heat and stifling humidity, traumatized and malnourished refugees are crammed into bamboo and canvas huts packed across muddy hillsides. Faeces lies in lanes that flood in the pouring rain. More than 3,000 latrines have been installed but many overflow and sit above pools and creeks where refugees bathe. Many new wells for drinking water are shallow and have become contaminated by sewage, said Paranietharan.  While we are doing this vaccination, it is not an alternative to fixing the water, sanitation and hygiene intervention, it just buys us time,  he said.  Sanitary facilities and hygiene promotion have still not met the standards. They need to be improved quickly.  In a dysentery clinic in Kutupalong camp run by the Medical Teams International group, patients with severe diarrhea lie motionless, moaning as intravenous fluid flows into them.  I believe we are facing a tsunami. We just don t know if it s going to be 10 feet or 50 feet,  said Bruce Murray, a physician at the clinic.  Cholera is known to be endemic in Bangladesh and now we are bringing in half a million people in squalid conditions and it s got to be inevitable. It s a matter of when it hits, rather than if,  he said. Murray said there could be  tens of thousands  of victims in an outbreak. Paranietharan said his organization had the capacity to handle 70,000 cholera cases.  As well as a handful of clinics, mobile teams are ready to go to inaccessible parts of the camps with oral rehydration salts that can save cholera patients if they can t get access to intravenous fluids. Aid workers worry they lack the staff to get the vaccines out quickly, while the WHO says it urgently needs $10.2 million to do the job properly. The first round of the vaccination campaign will cover 650,000 people aged one year and older. A second round will target 250,000 children aged between one and five with an additional dose for extra protection. ",

        "title": "Toned-down Trump does not mean retreat from policy: aide",
        "text": "(Reuters) - A promise that U.S. Republican front-runner Donald Trump will adopt a more presidential campaign style does not signal a retreat from core policies such as his pledge to build a wall on the Mexican border, his top adviser said on Sunday. Senior Trump aide Paul Manafort dismissed rival Republican candidate Ted Cruz\u2019s accusation that the real estate mogul had lied about his policies on immigration to \u201cfool gullible voters.\u201d The tussle over Trump\u2019s style and substance preceded Tuesday\u2019s Republican and Democratic nominating contests in Pennsylvania and four other Northeastern U.S. states: the next chapter in 2016\u2019s drawn-out selection of the candidates for November\u2019s presidential election. Cruz seized on Manafort\u2019s comments at a closed-door meeting of top Republican officials in Florida on Thursday that Trump, 69, would temper the image he has projected so far, saying the \u201cpart that he\u2019s been playing is now evolving.\u201d \u201cI never said Trump wasn\u2019t going to build a wall. I never said Trump was going to change any of his positions,\u201d Manafort said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d The adviser said Cruz, a 45-year-old U.S. senator from Texas who is Trump\u2019s closest rival, was trying to distract voters from his own difficult path to the nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasich, 63, is also vying to be the Republican candidate. But, despite Manafort\u2019s promise of a more restrained tone, Trump has continued to employ insulting nicknames at rallies, on Saturday referring to Cruz as \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted.\u201d The billionaire New Yorker has alarmed some senior party figures with unflattering descriptions of Mexicans, a pledge to immediately deport millions of illegal immigrants and a proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, among other things. The rhetoric has drawn protesters to Trump rallies, sometimes culminating in scuffles. On Sunday, the Connecticut State Police arrested a 20-year-old man, saying he had posted a threat on Twitter to bomb an upcoming Trump rally. On Tuesday - one week after Trump\u2019s crushing win in New York\u2019s primary election - Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island will hold their primaries.  Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign says the former secretary of state now has an essentially insurmountable lead over rival Bernie Sanders. The 74-year-old U.S. senator from Vermont has no plans to drop out of the race, according to his staff, who are counting on defying pollsters with some surprise wins on Tuesday. Trump is working to accrue the 1,237 delegates to the July 18-21 Republican National Convention needed to win the nomination outright. That would avert a contested convention, in which Cruz, Kasich or a dark-horse establishment figure could win the nomination on a second or subsequent ballot. Manafort predicted Trump would win the nomination on the first ballot at the Cleveland convention. Trump already has at least 844 delegates committed to him, according to the Associated Press. Cruz has 543 and Kasich has 148. In the five Northeastern states, 118 delegates will be at stake. Pennsylvania will also choose 54 delegates not bound to any candidate.  Trump has won more states overall than Cruz has, but the Texan has tried to keep Trump from winning the needed delegates by using selection rules that vary by state. In Colorado, for example, delegates were picked without a popular vote. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to say the process doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s trying to say voting doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Manafort said of Cruz on Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to say all that matters is to destroy the party and see who can pick up the pieces on a second, third or fourth ballot. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let that happen,\u201d Manafort said.  State nominating contests continue through June. Also on Sunday, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus played down conservative billionaire Charles Koch\u2019s comment that \u201cit\u2019s possible\u201d Clinton, 68, would make a better president than the Republicans in the race. \u201cCharles, in the past, has gone out of his way to make the case for him being a little bit less partisan than people would expect,\u201d Priebus said on ABC.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to come down to four to eight more years of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton or a different direction,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s going to be a very powerful case that we\u2019re going to be able to make as a party.\u201d Democrats, including Clinton, have criticized Koch and his brother, David Koch, for using their wealth and a huge funding network they helped organize to support politicians, usually Republican ones, who reflect their opposition to government regulation of industry. The Clinton campaign was not pleased with Koch\u2019s faint praise. A response to Koch\u2019s comments posted on Clinton\u2019s Twitter account said, \u201cNot interested in endorsements from people who deny climate science and try to make it harder for people to vote.\u201d ",

        "title": "Vietnam braces for typhoon as Philippine toll rises to 230 dead",
        "text": "HANOI/MANILA (Reuters) - Authorities in Vietnam prepared to move a million people from low-lying areas along the south coast on Monday as a typhoon approached after it battered the Philippines with floods and landslides that killed more than 230 people. Typhoon Tembin is expected to slam into Vietnam late on Monday after bringing misery to the predominantly Christian Philippines just before Christmas. Vietnam s disaster prevention committee said 74,000 people had been moved to safety from vulnerable areas, while authorities in 15 provinces and cities were prepared to move more than 1 million. The government ordered that oil rigs and vessels be protected and it warned that about 62,000 fishing boats should not venture out to sea.  Vietnam must ensure the safety of its oil rigs and vessels. If necessary, close the oil rigs and evacuate workers,  Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc was quoted as saying on a government website. Schools were ordered to close in the southern commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City on Monday, a working day in Vietnam. On Sunday, Tembin hit the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, parts of which are contested by several countries, including Vietnam and China.  No casualties were reported in outposts there. Vietnam, like the Philippines, is regularly battered by typhoons that form over the warm waters of the Pacific and barrel westwards into land. Tembin will be the 16th major storm to hit Vietnam this year. The storms and other disasters have left 390 people dead or missing, according to official figures. In the Philippines, rescue workers were still struggling to reach some remote areas hit by floods and landslides that Tembin s downpours brought, as the death toll climbed to more than 230. Scores of people are missing. The full extent of the devastation was only becoming clear as the most remote areas were being reached. Health worker Arturo Simbajon said nearly the entire coastal village of Anungan on the Zamboanga peninsula of Mindanao island had been wiped out by a barrage of broken logs, boulders and mud that swept down a river and out to sea.  Only the mosque was left standing,  Simbajon said.  People were watching the rising sea but did not expect the water to come from behind them.  Manuel Luis Ochotorena, head of regional disaster agency, said he expected the death toll to rise.  Many areas in Zamboanga peninsula are still without power and communications, some towns are cut off due to collapsed bridges, floods and landslides,  he said. Tens of thousands of people on Mindanao have been displaced by the storm, which struck late on Friday. The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons a year and warnings are routinely issued. But disaster officials said many villagers had ignored warnings this time to get out coastal areas and move away from riverbanks. In 2013, super typhoon Haiyan killed nearly 8,000 people and left 200,000 families homeless in the central Philippines.  (This version of the story was refiled to fix spelling in paragraph two) ",

        "title": "Puerto Rico evacuates area near crumbling dam, asks for aid",
        "text": "SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Many people living near a crumbling dam in storm-battered Puerto Rico have evacuated, Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Monday, as he asked for more government aid to avert a humanitarian crisis after Hurricane Maria. Much of the Caribbean island, a U.S. territory with a population of 3.4 million, is still without electricity five days after Maria struck with ferocious winds and torrential rains, the most powerful hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly a century. There have been growing concerns for some 70,000 people who live in the river valley below the Guajataca Dam in the island s northwest, where cracks were seen on Friday in the 88-year-old earthen structure. Rossello said he was working on the assumption that the 120-foot (35-meter) dam would collapse.   I d rather be wrong on that front than doing nothing and having that fail and costing people lives,  he said in an interview with CNN.  Most of the people in the near vicinity have evacuated.  It was unclear if the governor was saying that most of the 70,000 valley inhabitants had left the area, or only the several hundred people living in the small towns closest to the dam. About 320 people from those towns have moved to safety, according to local media. The fear of a potentially catastrophic dam break added to the immense task facing disaster relief authorities after Maria, which was the second major hurricane to strike the Caribbean this month. The storm killed at least 29 people in the region, at least 10 of those in Puerto Rico, which was already battling an economic crisis.  Rossello said that before the storms struck, he had been embarking on an aggressive fiscal agenda that included more than $1.5 billion in cuts.  This is a game changer,  he told CNN.  This is a completely different set of circumstances. This needs to be taken into consideration otherwise there will be a humanitarian crisis.  Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and Tom Bossert, senior adviser to the Department of Homeland Security, met with Rossello on Monday. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters in Washington that the administration was engaged in a fact-finding process to figure out how much help Puerto Rico needs.  The federal response has been anything but slow,  Sanders said at the daily briefing.  In fact, there s been an unprecedented push through of billions of dollars in federal assistance that the administration has fought for.  Many structures on Puerto Rico, including hospitals, remain badly damaged and flooded, with clean drinking water hard to find in some areas. Few planes have been able to land or take off from damaged airports. The storm has also put a big strain on PREPA, the island s electricity utility, which declared bankruptcy in July after accumulating a $9 billion debt and years of underinvestment. From preliminary FEMA reports, it is estimated that 55 percent of transmission towers may be down, and that more than 90 percent of the distribution system could have been destroyed. More than 91 percent of Puerto Rico s cellphone sites are also out of service, the Federal Communications Commission said. There are more than 10,000 federal staff, including more than 700 people from FEMA, doing recovery work in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to FEMA. The National Weather Service warned of further flash floods in the west of the island on Monday as thunderstorms moved in. Maria would likely be downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm on Tuesday night, the National Hurricane Center said. As of 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Monday, the center said, it was about 300 miles (480 km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, heading slowly north.  The storm was unlikely to hit the continental United States directly, but the NHC said large swells were affecting the U.S. East Coast. A tropical storm warning was in effect for much of the North Carolina coast and officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for visitors to Ocracoke Island in the Outer Banks that went into effect at 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT) on Monday.

        "title": "Border without doctors? South Koreans urge more funding for trauma care after defector drama",
        "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - A defector s treatment for critical injuries suffered during a dramatic dash from North Korea has highlighted a shortage of South Korean trauma doctors and again underscored Seoul s lack of preparedness in the event of hostilities with Pyongyang. The defector, identified only by his family name of Oh, was shot at least four times by his former comrades during his daring escape into South Korea last week. American military helicopters flew the wounded soldier not to one of the many hospitals in Seoul, closer to the border, but to the Ajou University trauma center an hour south of the capital. The center, and its lead surgeon John Cook-Jong Lee, have been thrust into the spotlight amid a push for more trauma facilities and specialist doctors in a country still technically at war and where preventable trauma death rates are already amongst the highest in the OECD.      An official at South Korea s Ministry of Health said more than 30 percent of people who suffered fatal trauma injuries last year could have survived if they had access to proper, timely treatment. That s far higher than the 10 to 15 percent in places such as the United States and Japan.  Although 133 surgeons are currently entitled to perform trauma surgery, I highly doubt that all of them can actually perform,  said Park Chan-yong, general affairs manager of the Korean Society of Traumatology.  Many of them just gained the rights, but never had practiced this kind of surgery.  By Friday, attention sparked by the defector s case had prompted nearly 200,000 South Koreans to join a petition asking the presidential Blue House to boost funding for Lee s trauma center, one of just nine in the country. During increased tensions this year with heavily armed North Korea, Seoul has faced criticism over a lack of preparation for major emergencies, with many bomb shelters, for example, laying forgotten and unstocked with food or water.  The government has launched programs to raise awareness, but public emergency drills often fail to attract much response. Despite the apparent need for specialists, Lee said he has faced  ignorance,  including from some doctors who complained he was showing off with new techniques, since returning from training in the United States in 2003.  I had to explain whenever I met new doctors here, what a trauma surgeon was. Every day,  he said.  Often, trauma medicine is not seen as attractive or lucrative as other fields, said Park.  Residents and medical students avoid coming to traumatology, because there is no hope and no dream.   The South Korean government says it recognizes the problem, and in 2014 set a goal of lowering its rate of preventable trauma fatalities to levels closer to those of other OECD countries by 2020. But with a shortage of funding, only half of a planned 17 regional trauma centers have been built so far, a health ministry official said. Germany, for example, has less than twice the population of South Korea, but 10 times as many operational trauma centers. South Korea s strict gun control laws also mean there are far fewer gunshot wounds like those suffered by the defector.  Between January 2012 and August 2017, 31 people were killed and 51 wounded by guns, according to the police. In comparison, in the United States, where Lee trained, more than 33,000 people die from gunshot wounds every year, according to annual averages of government data. However, the kinds of industrial accidents and car crashes commonly seen in South Korea can cause equally bad injuries, Lee said.  In South Korea, roughly speaking, more than 90 percent of trauma victims are brought to the hospital in less than an hour,  Lee said.  However, frequently, they are put in emergency rooms for a while, sometime for hours, to get proper care.  Lee has made a name for himself and the Ajou trauma center, in part by cultivating a close relationship with the American and South Korean militaries, making it an obvious choice for the defector s treatment. Lee said his fascination with the American medical evacuation crews and the techniques he learned in the United States have led him to push for a series of new additions at the trauma center, including a recently completed roof-top helipad with flashing neon messages in English for American pilots.  U.S. military air crews, however, have yet to obtain Pentagon permission to use the new helipad, Lee said. The arrival of the North Korean defector has brought Lee a new round of criticism for appearing to seek attention,  including from one lawmaker, a charge he says is unfounded. But it has also highlighted the need for more funding for his center and more trauma facilities in South Korea.  To those who get only 10, 20 minutes of sleep while working to save emergency room patients, to those who only get to go home once a week or not even that   we should not be criticizing them but rather, discuss how to resolve problems within the system,  the petition submitted to the Blue House said.

        "title": "Instant View: Senate plan delays corporate tax cut, won't repeal Obamacare mandate",
        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans\u2019 version of a tax cut bill will delay corporate rate cuts by one year to take effect in 2019, and will not include a repeal of Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, Republican Senate Finance Committee member Bill Cassidy said.  Story: [L1N1NF1MP] GARY BRADSHAW, PORTFOLIO MANAGER OF HODGES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN DALLAS \u201cI do think the market would like to see this tax cut and if it\u2019s delayed, certainly it is going to have a big effect on small caps, they are probably off the most.\u201d \u201cI think the market is anticipating that we get this tax cut through, that it would really drive earnings. You look at S&P earnings next year projected to be about $145, you get a tax cut it would probably be (a little above $150). If we don\u2019t have that, earnings are going to be tempered some. Obviously a little of the tax cut has been in the market already and if it\u2019s delayed some of that good news is coming out.\u201d MICHAEL O\u2019ROURKE, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, JONESTRADING, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: \u201cThat was the catalyst for the recent leg down,\u201d he said, referring to the headlines that the Senate tax proposal will delay the corp tax rate cut to 2019.  \u201cMaking sure we don\u2019t drive the deficit too much higher is going to be key here. That makes sense why they would push the corporate tax cut back. But at the same time, we\u2019re not getting to the point where we have a plan that seems workable yet. \u201cThe market is due for a breather. It\u2019s been a year since the election. We\u2019ve gone up 22 percent on hopes of what the Trump agenda would bring, and while they\u2019re trying to work toward this thing, they haven\u2019t really accomplished much yet. If progress is not made, the equity market should either pause or correct until meaningful progress is made.\u201d RICK MECKLER, PRESIDENT OF INVESTMENT FIRM LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY \u201cInvestors view the corporate tax cut as central to higher near-term stock prices. Once you delay it, the more time that goes on the more further changes can happen. This has been a bit of an emotional roller coaster for investors. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to see some divergence between House, Senate and White House, all three of which are controlled by Republicans. That suggests that whatever is agreed to will probably look quite a bit different if its signed into law. \u201cThe sell off is a quick reaction to how much uncertainty is ahead when it comes to significant corporate tax change.\u201d JOE SALUZZI, CO-MANAGER OF TRADING AT THEMIS TRADING IN CHATHAM, NEW JERSEY  \u201cNervous Nellies are going to read the headlines, I have the feeling we are going to be headline driven until they finish this thing off, whenever that may be. If it is a market that has been based on tax cuts, or a good chunk of the rally has been, you would expect it to pullback if there is a potential breakup in the talks or a delay. It looks like this last leg was based on a delay of potentially a year on the Senate side. So totally expected you would see that. But I would also expect it to rip right back if all of a sudden they come out and say they are making progress.  \u201cOther than that there is really nothing fundamentally changed. Nothing new today, economic numbers - nothing was really out of line. It is certainly tax driven. If there is a decent headline that comes out by the end of the day we will rally right back. Maybe people are not nervous, they shouldn\u2019t be, but I hope there is no complacency in the market, I am always worried about that. But I don\u2019t see this as a big deal yet.\u201d  SUBADRA RAJAPPA, HEAD OF U.S. STRATEGY, SG CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANKING, NEW YORK \u201cIn the bond market, we reacted initially to the selloff in Europe. Now we are giving some of it back because of the concerns about the implementation of the tax plan. The difference between House and Senate plans have be reconciled. They have to make the math work with the agreed upon $1.5 trillion projected addition to the deficit. They feel the better start for the corporate tax cut is 2019. We saw some pressure on the high yield spreads the past few sessions with evaluations being frothy. This combined with the tax plan have put some downward pressure on yields. The news on the tax front hasn\u2019t been very positive. The devils are always in the details. There\u2019s a bit more worry about which of the proposals will get though and how. I personally think they would have trouble to get through reconciliation in such short order.\u201d PARESH UPADHYAYA, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY STRATEGY AT AMUNDI PIONEER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, BOSTON \u201cI think the markets are getting a bit jittery over details of the plan as it looks like it is going to be pushed off another year. The initial reaction is disappointment over the Senate plan. Of course that\u2019s not going to be the final plan, but the initial reaction is certainly negative for the dollar. \u201cThe momentum of the dollar has been hit on concerns about the tax plan, that this could take longer than people had expected. That\u2019s why the dollar momentum seems to have stalled.\u201d STOCKS: U.S. stocks extended losses in mid-day trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 227.01 points, or 0.96 percent, to 23,336.35, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 25.34 points, or 0.98 percent, to 2,569.04 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 94.96 points, or 1.4 percent, to 6,694.16.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. Republican trade lawmaker on Wednesday questioned the Trump administration\u2019s plans to renegotiate a trade deal with U.S. ally South Korea, as well as the White House\u2019s focus on bilateral trade deals. \u201cI was a little surprised by the announcement on Korea by the president, mainly because that agreement\u2019s worked well for us,\u201d Representative Kevin Brady told Reuters in an interview. The U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office notified South Korea last week of its intent to negotiate amendments to the pact, calling for talks to start in August. Republican President Donald Trump said in April he planned to renegotiate or terminate what he called a \u201chorrible\u201d trade deal. Since the pact, known as KORUS, went into effect in 2012, the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled to nearly $28 billion last year.  Brady, who chairs the trade- and tax-focused Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives, said the United States should be \u201caggressively stepping into the Asia-Pacific market.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not an easy task if you\u2019re going to go at trade country-by-country ... This is a question of, do we want American trade values in the world or do we want China\u2019s trade values?\u201d Brady said. Three days after taking office in January, Trump officially withdrew the United States from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, keeping an election campaign promise and emphasizing a preference for bilateral trade deals. Some critics of that move have said it opened a trade policy vacuum in Asia that China would move to fill. \u201cClearly, this administration believes it can achieve more in the bilaterals. They deserve an opportunity to prove that\u2019s the case,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI think regional agreements, multilateral, work because you can set standards across a broad number of countries.\u201d ",

        "text": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - Several dozen women in Kenya said police officers attacked them during this year s election season and some said they were raped by men in uniform, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Thursday. More than 70 people were killed in an election in August, later nullified by the Supreme Court, and a repeat presidential poll in October won by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The opposition boycotted the repeat poll and said it would not be fair. The sexual attacks, mostly on women, occurred over this period in some of Nairobi s slums and in two opposition strongholds, Kisumu and Bungoma, in western Kenya, HRW said in a report.   Kenyan police dispute rights groups  allegations that officers used excessive force to quell election-related unrest. They did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment on the report. One 28-year-old woman in the Nairobi slum of Mathare told Reuters:  Four men in police uniforms burst into my home and my children were sleeping, they pulled my husband out. One grabbed my neck, the other pulled off my clothes, another beat me with a stick, and the other forced sex on me.   The woman who declined to be identified said she was four months pregnant and miscarried shortly after the rape.  I was bleeding and confused afterwards,  she said.    Another woman, aged 26, said:  Two men dragged me away from my friend, stripped off my clothes and one raped me as another one held me down.   Kenyan women who have been raped - they are lonely and abandoned and ashamed,  said HRW researcher Agnes Odhiambo.  It s the Kenyan government who should feel shame for failing to protect them and help them get medical treatment.   Kenyan rights groups accuse police of brutality and extrajudicial killings.  A government civilian watchdog tasked to oversee the police exists, but few officers are charged and convictions are extremely rare.  The sexual violence mirrored widespread violations against women after a disputed 2007 vote, when 1,200 people were killed, HRW said. At the time, the group documented at least 900 cases of sexual violence but said this was likely an underestimate.  The new cases related to the August and October 2017 elections demonstrate a disturbing continuum,  Tina Alai, a lawyer with New York-based Physicians for Human Rights.  Police have continued to perpetrate sexual violence against civilians they are obligated to protect,  she said. ",

        "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish prosecutors said on Wednesday they will review legal cases against 11,480 people after finding they had been re-directed unwittingly to a messaging app linked to suspects in last year s failed coup. Turkey has so far identified 215,000 users of the messaging app ByLock, which was believed to be used by supporters of a U.S.-based cleric blamed for the failed July 2016 coup attempt. It launched investigations against more than 23,000 of them. But on Wednesday the Ankara prosecutor s office said many of them had been re-directed to ByLock without their knowledge or consent, after downloading a different app which had functions for prayer times and music.  As a result of a detailed examination, it has been determined that 11,480 GSM number users with similar properties in terms of connection data parameters were unwittingly re-directed to ByLock IPs, it said. State-run Anadolu news agency quoted Ankara chief prosecutor Yuksel Kocaman as saying that he would ask for nearly 1,000 people to be released unless there was other evidence against them.  He said an arrest warrant had been issued for the developer of the other app which had re-directed users to ByLock. Authorities say ByLock was widely used by followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who the government blames for orchestrating the failed military coup in which 250 people were killed. Gulen has denied any involvement. Since the coup attempt, more than 50,000 people, including civil servants and security personnel, have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs. Rights groups say the crackdown has been exploited to muzzle dissent. The government says the measures have been necessary due to the security threats which Turkey has faced since the putsch. ",

        "text": "BEIRUT/PARIS (Reuters) - Lebanon s president said on Thursday he hoped the crisis over Saad al-Hariri s resignation as prime minister would end soon, with Hariri due to leave Saudi Arabia for France this weekend. Hariri quit in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4, railing against Riyadh s bitter foe Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah.  The shock resignation thrust Lebanon into both a domestic political crisis and the Middle East s overarching rivalry that pits Saudi Arabia and its allies against a bloc led by Iran. A Elysee Palace source said Hariri would fly to Paris on Saturday and meet President Emmanuel Macron the same day.  French officials said they did not know how long Hariri would stay before returning to Beirut but hoped his trip would help soothe the crisis by demonstrating he was not being held in Saudi Arabia, as Lebanon s President Michel Aoun has said.  His arrival will ease tensions by showing he s free to move around,  said a French diplomatic source.  There would be consultations before he returns to Beirut to build international support for him to negotiate a new political deal in Lebanon, French officials said.       We re not trying to find a compromise or open dialogue between sides, but trying to create the conditions for a de-escalation in the region.

Hariri accepted an invitation to France on Thursday after meeting French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who was visiting Saudi Arabia. Aoun, who has refused to accept Hariri s resignation unless he returns to Lebanon, has accused Riyadh of holding Hariri hostage. He said on Thursday on Twitter he hoped  the crisis is over  and the France visit would open the door to a solution. Lebanon maintains a delicate sectarian balance, after Sunnis, Shi ites, Christians and Druze fought a 1975-1990 civil war, with factions often backed by regional rivals. Hariri, a Sunni Muslim, is a long-term ally of Saudi Arabia. Aoun, a Christian, is a political ally of Hezbollah, the heavily armed Shi ite Muslim movement that is backed by Iran. Hariri s government, a power-sharing coalition formed last year, includes Hezbollah.  Since Hariri announced his resignation, Saudi Arabia has  accused Lebanon of declaring war on it, citing Hezbollah s role fighting in other Arab countries. On Thursday, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Saudi Arabia was consulting with its allies about what leverage to use against Hezbollah.  We will make the decision when the time comes,  he told Reuters in an interview. Top Lebanese officials and senior politicians close to Hariri say he was forced to quit and was being held by the Saudis. Politicians from all sides in Lebanon have called for his return to Beirut.  Saudi Arabia has denied forcing Hariri to resign or detaining him. In an interview on Sunday, his first public comments since resigning, Hariri said he is free to leave and would return home soon to formally submit his resignation. He also warned of possible Saudi action against Lebanon, including sanctions and threats to the livelihood of Lebanese workers in the Gulf, unless Hezbollah is reined in.  Aoun said in a statement that once Hariri returned to Lebanon he would have to stay until a new government was formed.  Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil has toured European capitals seeking diplomatic help to end the crisis. On Friday he is to go to Russia, after visiting Germany and Turkey on Thursday.   The issue is one of freedom ... of international conventions related to immunity,  Bassil said in Ankara after meeting with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.  France s foreign minister, Le Drian, said Paris was working to normalize the situation in Lebanon. After meeting Le Drian, Jubeir described Hezbollah as an arm of Iran s Revolutionary Guards and said it must disarm for Lebanon to be stable.   Whenever we see a problem, we see Hezbollah act as an arm or agent of Iran and this has to come to an end,  he said. ",

        "title": "Senator McCain, visiting Pakistan, seeks better ties in Islamist fight",
        "text": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain said on Sunday he would like relations between United States and Pakistan to improve as they have a common enemy in the Islamic State and other radical Islamist groups. Relations between Pakistan and United States have been frayed over the past decade, with U.S. officials frustrated by what they term Islamabad\u2019s unwillingness to act against Islamist groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network. Pakistan rejects harboring militants but says there are limits to how much it can do as it is already fighting multiple Islamist groups and is wary of \u201cblowback\u201d in the form of more terror attacks on its soil.  McCain, visiting Pakistan as part of a U.S. delegation, said he had an \u201cexcellent meeting\u201d with Pakistani foreign ministry officials. \u201cWe come back with a message that we have a common enemy in ISIS, radical Islam and terrorism, and we look forward to closer relations and resolving the differences we have,\u201d McCain told Pakistan\u2019s national PTV channel. Relations between United States and Pakistan were tested again in May by a U.S. drone strike that killed Afghan Taliban chief Mullah Akhtar Mansour on Pakistani soil.  As part of the visit, McCain traveled to Miranshah, the capital of the restive North Waziristan region bordering Afghanistan. The region was effectively run Islamists by groups such as the Pakistani Taliban and the Haqqani network until the Pakistani military launched operations against them in 2014. \u201cI was very impressed with the progress (on the ground),\u201d said McCain, who is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cI see us working together in confronting a common challenge \u2013 radical Islamic terrorism \u2013 and these kinds of meetings are very helpful to both those countries,\u201d McCain added. The Islamic State has struggled to gain a major foothold in Pakistan, analysts say, but officials worry the group may pose a threat in the future.  Pakistan said the country\u2019s top foreign policy official Sartaj Aziz had briefed the U.S. delegation - which includes Senators Lindsey Graham, Benjamin Sasse and Joe Donnelly - about faltering peace talks to end the civil war in Afghanistan. So far China, United States and Pakistan have struggled to persuade the Afghan Taliban to meaningfully embrace the talks. \u201cNo country had as much vital stakes in the success of these joint efforts, as Pakistan, (Aziz) remarked,\u201d Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement.

        "title": "Senators unveil road map for self-driving car legislation",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan trio of U.S. senators said on Tuesday they planned to introduce legislation to remove regulatory roadblocks to the introduction of self-driving cars, including sorting out conflicts between state and federal rules. Republican Senator John Thune, who chairs the Commerce Committee, Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the panel, and Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said in a joint statement that existing federal vehicle regulations written over recent decades did not account for self-driving cars without a human driver behind the wheel. Thune said the senators hoped to reach agreement based on \u201cprioritizing safety, fixing outdated rules, and clarifying the role of federal and state governments.\u201d Federal auto regulations pose significant legal hurdles that must be cleared before fully self-driving cars can be sold without steering wheels and gas pedals, a government report said last year. The Senate Commerce Committee is holding a hearing on self-driving cars on Wednesday. Mitch Bainwol, head of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an auto trade group, will tell the panel that Congress should work to eliminate state or local laws that could \u201cunduly burden or restrict the use of self-driving vehicles in the future.\u201d The senators are joining a broader movement in Washington to respond to calls from Detroit and Silicon Valley for federal action to set rules for self-driving cars, rather than allowing states such as California to write potentially conflicting rules.  The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee told Reuters last week he planned to unveil a package of legislation to overhaul federal rules governing self-driving vehicles. Companies such as Alphabet Inc, General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) are pursuing automated technologies and want unified federal regulations to replace outdated rules and make it simpler to develop and eventually sell the technology across the country. In April, automakers and technology companies urged California to make changes to its proposed state regulations governing autonomous vehicles. Many oppose California\u2019s plan to require a state permit to deploy autonomous vehicles, which must meet performance and design criteria. The U.S. Transportation Department said last week it would unveil revised self-driving guidelines within the next few months, responding to automakers\u2019 calls for regulations to sanction costly efforts to put autonomous vehicles on the road. Vehicle crashes annually kill more than 35,000 people on U.S. roads and injure 2.4 million. The economic cost of vehicle crashes is at least $240 billion annually, the government says. ",

        "title": "Upgrade with a dab of TPP may be U.S. recipe for NAFTA revamp",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some provisions of the Trans-Pacific Partnership President Donald Trump quit as part of his pledge to protect American workers from \u201cbad trade deals\u201d may still serve to shape a revised NAFTA trade pact, U.S. officials and trade experts say. Trump threatened to ditch the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement too, but eventually decided to renegotiate the pact in talks with Mexico and Canada due to begin in mid-August. On Monday U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will offer first insights into the administration\u2019s strategy when he presents Congress its objectives for the NAFTA negotiations. Several U.S. administration  officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Lighthizer will outline plans for updating NAFTA rather than seek a major overhaul of the agreement. While the administration has said it hopes to complete NAFTA negotiations by the end of the year, the strategy will not set a timeline, they say. Thus far, the Trump administration offered few specifics, other than expressing its desire to modernize the pact to account for digital trade that was in its infancy in the early 1990s and to tackle festering issues on labor, environment, intellectual property rights and state-owned enterprises.    Since those areas have already been addressed in the TPP negotiated under Democratic President Barack Obama and agreed by Canada and Mexico, the pact provides a useful template that could help speed up the NAFTA negotiations, U.S. officials say. They warn, however, that no final decision has been made on using TPP language. TPP requires members, for example, to allow independent unions, set working hours and safety standards and deter forced labor and has set higher environment standards than any other previous U.S. trade deal.  The pact also set a 70-year copyright term and eight years of patent protection for costly biologic drugs, significantly less than the 12 years applied in the United States. Lawmakers from the U.S. industrial heartland particularly want to see enforceable labor standards that would lift Mexico\u2019s chronically low wages, which they blame for U.S. factories migrating south of the border. \u201cA lot of the negotiators were just in the room a few years ago doing this stuff. They know where the bodies are buried,\u201d said one business executive with knowledge of NAFTA deliberations. Some lawmakers want a more ambitious deal than TPP. \u201cDonald Trump promised to get a better deal than TPP, and Americans are going to be deeply disappointed if he doesn\u2019t follow through on NAFTA negotiations,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee and an influential voice on trade matters. In particular, Canada and Mexico should be able to agree to U.S. proposals on digital trade and environment that got watered down in the final TPP text, Wyden told Reuters. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation chance to rewrite NAFTA. Trump can\u2019t squander this opportunity.\u201d The demands the Trump administration makes in the talks  could have far-reaching implications for U.S. trade relations across the globe, with China keen to make inroads with Mexico and Canada if the United States is seen to be pulling back. One area to watch will be the so-called rules of origin that determine how much regional content a product must have to be exempt from tariffs. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has frequently said NAFTA needed to tighten those rules to prevent China from using the trade bloc as a tariff-free \u201cback door\u201d to the U.S. market. Analysts say any U.S. demands for more specifically U.S. rather than broadly North American content for autos or other manufactured goods would be a tough sell, though Mexico has indicated it could be ready for some concessions to strengthen the region\u2019s defenses against Asian competition. Christopher Padilla, former U.S. under secretary for international trade at the U.S. Commerce Department now at IBM, believes that merely \u201ctweaking\u201d the rules of origin would be enough to satisfy Trump\u2019s political agenda, but it still may require companies to alter their supply chains. The clarion call from U.S. business groups in the lead-up to the talks is \u201cdo no harm.\u201d U.S. and international companies have invested hundreds of billions of dollars building integrated North American supply networks and Trump rang alarm bells in corporate boardrooms in April when he threatened to terminate the pact. Trump backed off after a furious lobbying effort, but analysts say he may still choose a \u201chard exit\u201d if the talks fail to achieve his goal of shrinking the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico. NAFTA has quadrupled trade between the three countries, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015. Over a decade through to 2010, however, the United States lost nearly 6 million manufacturing jobs, a figure that resonates with Trump. U.S. trade balance with Mexico also swung from a small surplus in 1994 to deficits that have exceeded $60 billion for most of the past decade. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/2oYClp2) Fred Bergsten, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the administration would risk derailing the talks if it focused on reducing the trade imbalance with Mexico, like it has threatened to do. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about an imbalance of $60 billion and there is no way under the sun that Mexico can eliminate that or even make a big dent in that without doing some really massive uneconomic distortion of trade flows.\u201d ",

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, at NATO headquarters in Brussels, says he does not see the conditions for military collaboration with Russia - a blow to Moscow\u2019s hopes for repairing ties with the United States following Trump\u2019s election. Trump says he will issue a new executive order to replace his controversial directive suspending travel to the United States by citizens of seven mostly Muslim countries.   Trump announces his new choice to lead the Department of Labor, former National Labor Relations Board member Alexander Acosta, after his original pick withdrew under congressional pressure. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward, has turned down the offer, a senior White House official says. The Senate moves closer to approving President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency even as nearly 800 former officials urge the chamber to reject the nominee. U.S.-ISRAEL The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations says the United States still supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a day after Trump suggested he was open to new ways to achieve peace. Trump\u2019s uttering the phrase \u201cone-state\u201d - rather than a two-state solution to the conflict, the bedrock of international diplomacy for two decades - took him to a place in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict where past presidents feared to tread. Trump\u2019s nominee to be ambassador to Israel faces repeated heckling at a Senate confirmation hearing before apologizing for his stinging criticism of liberal American Jews and promising to be less inflammatory in an official capacity.

        "text": "BARCELONA (Reuters) - Demonstrators calling for Catalan independence gathered in hundreds of towns across the region on Sunday following Madrid s actions last week to try to block a referendum on self rule that it considers illegal. Spanish police have arrested Catalan officials who were involved in organizing the Oct. 1 vote and they also seized electoral material, including ballot papers and ballot boxes. This led to several days of protests in Barcelona. But Carles Puigdemont, the head of the Catalan regional government, has said the referendum will go ahead. Several thousand protesters gathered in central Barcelona on Sunday chanting  We will vote!  and handing out ballot papers. The crowds began whistling and booing a police helicopter during speeches by the protest organizers, showing growing anger among the referendum supporters about the increased police presence. Between 3,000 and 4,000 state police officers from other regions of Spain have arrived or are on their way to Catalonia.  We feel occupied by the Spanish police,  56-year-old interior designer Nuria Gimenez said.  We ve been protesting for 10 years, we re not going to stop now with one week to go. We need to keep going until the end.  On Saturday, the state prosecutor in Catalonia told all local and national police forces they would be placed temporarily under a single chain of command and report directly to the interior ministry in Madrid. The Catalan government initially said it would refuse the order, though the head of the Catalan regional police, known as the Mossos d Esquadra, later said he would comply with prosecutors. Speaking to the crowd in Barcelona, president of the Catalan Parliament Carme Forcadell said that separatists must resist  provocations  by the central government.  They see violence in Catalonia. There has been none, nor will there be. We are a peaceful people and all we want is to exercise our rights,  Forcadell said.  Although polls show less than half of Catalonia s 5.5 million voters want self-rule, most in the wealthy northeastern region want the chance to vote on the issue. ",

        "text": "MUNICH, Germany (Reuters) - Victims of the attack on the Israeli team at the 1972 Olympic Games were remembered by Germany and Israel on Wednesday with a memorial, following a long campaign by their relatives. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his Israeli counterpart Reuven Rivlin attended the inauguration of the  Munich 1972 massacre memorial  at Munich s Olympic Park, 45 years after the attack by Palestinian gunmen.  Relatives of the victims and the state of Israel waited almost half a century for this moment,  Rivlin said.  45 years have passed for an official Israeli delegation to return to this place. The Munich Olympics became the blood Olympics.  Members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage on Sept. 5, 1972, at the poorly secured athletes village by Palestinians from the Black September group. Eleven Israelis, a German policeman as well as five of the Palestinian gunmen died after a stand-off at the village and then a nearby airfield, as police rescue efforts failed. The memorial offers some comfort for relatives who have also long demanded a minute s silence at the Opening Ceremonies of Olympics Games, only to be consistently turned down by the IOC. Steinmeier said it had taken too long for the memorial to be built.  It is high time and we owe it firstly to you, the relatives,  Steinmeier said.  The Olympic village became a place of Palestinian terrorists, a stage for their boundless hatred for Israel. It should never have happened.  Ankie Spitzer, whose fencing coach husband, Andre, was one of the victims, and Ilana Romano, wife of weightlifter Joseph Romano, have waged a decades-long campaign to get a commemoration at the Games  opening ceremony.  We wanted this memorial. In the years after we heard voices that us Israelis brought war to Germany and the terrorists were hailed as freedom fighters,  Romano said.  That hurt so much but we did not give up. We knew our way was the right one ... for the future of our children and the next generations,  she added. The IOC, whose president Thomas Bach was also present, has said opening ceremonies are not the appropriate platform and has instead made other gestures to remember the victims. At last year s Rio de Janeiro Games the IOC inaugurated  the Place of Mourning , a small park which will be a feature at every Olympics. ",

        "title": "Trump wins Christie backing, marches toward Super Tuesday",
        "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas (Reuters) - Republican candidate Donald Trump on Friday won the surprise endorsement of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the most prominent mainstream Republican to get behind the former reality TV star\u2019s White House campaign. Christie said the billionaire front-runner has the best chance of beating Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election - although Clinton has yet to secure her party\u2019s nomination.  The endorsement gives Trump a further lift before next week\u2019s Super Tuesday nominating contests. It comes just a day after he took a battering from his two main rivals at a televised Republican debate.  Trump\u2019s unorthodox candidacy has stirred controversy and shaken the Republican Party at its roots, but an increasing number of senior Republicans are becoming resigned to the idea he will be their candidate in November.      Trump is \u201crewriting the playbook,\u201d said Christie, 53, who until two weeks ago was himself a rival for the Republican nomination. Christie dropped out after failing to muster much support for his candidacy.     Trump, 69, who has never held public office, has campaigned as a political outsider. He is riding a wave of voter anger at the slow economic recovery, illegal immigration and what he says is America\u2019s diminishing role in the world.     \u201cThe best person to beat Hillary Clinton in November on that stage last night is undoubtedly Donald Trump,\u201d Christie told a news conference on Friday, a day after the last Republican candidates\u2019 debate before Super Tuesday. The debate marked a new, more aggressive approach for U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, 44, who has emerged as the Republican establishment\u2019s challenger to Trump. The other main challenger at the debate was U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Trump has unsettled mainstream Republicans by winning three straight nominating contests - in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Polls show he is likely to win big in key primaries on Tuesday. \u201cSince I started this whole thing I\u2019ve been practically Number 1,\u201d Trump said on Friday at a rally in Texas.  The 11 Republican nominating contests on Tuesday have a total of almost 600 delegates at stake, and could set Trump up to clinch the presidential nomination. Reuters/Ipsos polling data on Friday showed Trump ahead nationally in the Republican race with support at 44.2 percent, followed by Cruz at 20.7 percent and Rubio in third place at 14 percent.     On the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Clinton is battling U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Clinton and Sanders have been in a dead head over the past week, the Reuters/Ipsos data shows. Trump has vowed to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border to halt illegal immigration, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and promised to take a tough stance on trade against China.   He was combative at a rally on Friday. He mocked Rubio, referred to violent Islamist militants as \u201cthese animals\u201d and promised to defend Americans\u2019 constitutional right to bear arms. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build up our military, we\u2019re going to knock out ISIS. We\u2019re going to knock out ISIS fast,\u201d he said, referring to the Islamic State militant group.  Wielding a water bottle as a prop, Trump made fun of Rubio for an awkward incident in which the senator grabbed for a drink of water off camera during an important televised speech in 2013.  Rubio and Cruz ganged up on Trump at Thursday\u2019s debate in Houston in a last-ditch bid to keep him from winning in states on Super Tuesday.      Rubio on Friday again took aim at Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a con man who\u2019s taking advantage of people\u2019s fears and anxieties about the future, portraying himself as some sort of strong guy,\u201d Rubio told reporters in Oklahoma. \u201cHe\u2019s not a strong guy. He\u2019s never faced real adversity before.\u201d PredictWise, a research project that analyzes opinion polls and betting markets, said Trump would comfortably win among Republicans in all but one of the 11 Super Tuesday states that it measured. Cruz, 45, is likely to win in his home state of Texas, PredictWise said. Rubio\u2019s home state of Florida is not part of the Super Tuesday contests. PredictIt, based out of Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, on Friday gave Trump a 73 percent chance of winning the nomination compared with a peak 75 percent chance two days earlier.      Trump\u2019s swipes at rival candidates and heated exchanges with journalists and others have for months bolstered his standing in nominating contests and opinion polls.  In a post on Twitter, Trump took aim at Rubio, a first-term senator, for his debate performance. \u201cLightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a chocker (sic)! Mr. Meltdown.\u201d   Republican strategist Doug Heye said Christie may have opened the door for more mainstream Republican endorsements of a man whose chances of winning the White House were seen as next to nil a year ago.     \u201cIf you\u2019re the Trump campaign this is obviously very good news and it gives permission for others to endorse. But it also makes it hard (for Trump) to make the outsider argument,\u201d he said.   Glenn Hubbard, who had been an adviser to the campaign of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and was chair of the Council of Economic Advisers during the George H.W. Bush administration, said he planned to keep up steady criticism of Trump on economic issues.  \u201cI think it is time for serious people to stand up and be counted.

Hubbard, now dean of the business school at Columbia University, told Reuters he worried Trump\u2019s comments already hurt the country\u2019s image abroad and would hobble his ability to govern if elected.

        "title": "Merkel points to grand coalition with Social Democrats",
        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday welcomed the prospect of talks on a  grand coalition  with her Social Democrat (SPD) rivals and defended the record of the previous such government, saying it had worked well. Merkel s fourth term was cast into doubt when the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) walked out of three-way coalition talks with her conservative bloc and the Greens last Sunday, causing a political impasse in Europe s biggest economy. But on Friday, the SPD reversed a previous decision and agreed to talk to Merkel, raising the possibilities of a new  grand coalition  which has ruled Germany for the last four years, or of a minority government. Addressing party members on Saturday, Merkel argued voters had given her conservatives a mandate to rule in the Sept. 24 election which handed her party the most parliamentary seats but limited coalition options. Her conservatives bled support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).  Europe needs a strong Germany, it is desirable to get a government in place quickly,  Merkel told a regional party meeting in northern Germany, adding, however, that her acting government could carry on day to day business.  Asking voters to go to the polls again would, I think be totally wrong,  she said. On Monday, Merkel had said she would prefer new elections to a minority government in which her party would be only held in power by others. Without even mentioning the option of a minority government, Merkel said she wanted to look ahead after the setbacks of the last week. Sounding self-assured and drawing applause during her speech, she turned her attention fully to the SPD.  Welcoming the prospect of talks with her former partner, she defended the record of the last coalition.  We worked well together,  she said, adding under the grand coalition, Germany enjoyed the strongest labor market for decades, a balanced budget and pensioners and families had benefited, she argued. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is to host Merkel, SPD leader Martin Schulz and the leader of her conservative CSU  sister party for a meeting on Thursday. Steinmeier had exerted considerable pressure on Schulz to change course for the sake of stability in Germany. However, no one is saying things will be easy and the two former partners are already jostling over policy.  Merkel said her aims are to maintain Germany s solid finances, cut some taxes and expand the digital infrastructure.  In a nod to her CSU conservative allies, she also said she aims to limit the number of migrants entering Germany to 200,000 per year. This, however, may be hard for the SPD to swallow.  A cap, which may not be called that, breaches the constitution and the Geneva Convention. With the SPD there will be no limit put on family members who want to join asylum seekers,  SPD deputy leader Ralf Stegner told the Funke media group.  Schulz, who had until Friday rejected any deal with Merkel, said there was nothing automatic about the outcome and promised party members a vote on talks.  The SPD is split as many members fear that renewing a grand coalition would be political suicide. It scored its worst result since 1933 in the September election. Several other leading SPD members have called for other commitments, such as investment in education and homes.  Some senior SPD members have made clear that they will not let Merkel hold them hostage.  Mrs Merkel is not in a position to be setting conditions,  Malu Dreyer, premier of the state of Rhineland Palatinate, told the Trierscher Volksfreund. ",

        "text": "DHAKA (Reuters) - Pope Francis celebrated a huge outdoor Mass on Friday to ordain new priests from Bangladesh on his first full day in the country where he is due to meet Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar later in the day. More than 100,000 people attended the Mass in Dhaka s Suhrawardy Udyan Park, site of a memorial and museum of Bangladesh s independence from Pakistan in 1971, where Francis arrived in an open popemobile. Catholics make up less than one percent of the population of 169 million people in majority-Muslim Bangladesh.  I know that many of you came from afar, for a trip for more than two days,  the pope told the crowd in his homily.  Thank you for your generosity. This indicates the love you have for the Church.  At an inter-religious gathering later on Friday, the pope was due to meet 18 Rohingya refugees who have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar where authorities have been accused of ethnic cleansing by the United States and United Nations. The government denies wrongdoing. In calls for peace in Myanmar, he did not use the word Rohingya to describe the refugees, which is contested by the Yangon government and military. The refugees were brought to the Bangladeshi capital from Cox s Bazar, to where 625,000 Rohingya from Myanmar s Rakhine state have fled. The exodus followed a Myanmar military crackdown in response to Rohingya militant attacks on an army base and police posts on Aug. 25. Scores of Rohingya villages were burnt to the ground, and refugees arriving in Bangladesh told of killings and rapes. On Thursday night, the pope called for decisive measures to resolve the political reasons that caused the refugee crisis and urged countries to help the Dhaka government deal with it. ",

        "title": "Exclusive: Returning Rohingya may lose land, crops under Myanmar plans",
        "text": "SITTWE, Myanmar (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslims who return to Myanmar after fleeing to Bangladesh are unlikely to be able to reclaim their land, and may find their crops have been harvested and sold by the government, according to officials and plans seen by Reuters. Nearly 600,000 Rohingya have crossed the border since Aug. 25, when coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts sparked a ferocious counteroffensive by the Myanmar army. The United Nations says killings, arson and rape carried out by troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist mobs since late August amount to a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya. Civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has no control over the military, has pledged that anyone sheltering in Bangladesh who can prove they were Myanmar residents can return. Reuters has interviewed six Myanmar officials involved with repatriation and resettlement plans. While the plans are not yet finalised, their comments reflect the government s thinking on how Suu Kyi s repatriation pledge will be implemented. Jamil Ahmed, who spoke to Reuters at a refugee camp in Bangladesh, is one of many Rohingya who hope to go back. Describing how he fled his home in northern Rakhine state in late August, Ahmed said one of the few things he grabbed was a stack of papers - land contracts and receipts - that might prove ownership of the fields and crops he was leaving behind.  I didn t carry any ornaments or jewels,  said the 35-year-old.  I ve only got these documents. In Myanmar, you need to present documents to prove everything.  The stack of papers, browning and torn at the edges, may not be enough, however, to regain the land in Kyauk Pan Du village, where he grew potatoes, chilli plants, almonds and rice.  It depends on them. There is no land ownership for those who don t have citizenship,  said Kyaw Lwin, agriculture minister in Rakhine state, when asked in an interview whether refugees who returned to Myanmar could reclaim land and crops. Despite his land holdings, Myanmar does not recognize Ahmed as a citizen. Nearly all the more than 1 million Rohingya who lived in Myanmar before the recent exodus are stateless, despite many tracing their families in the country for generations. Officials have made plans to harvest, and possibly sell, thousands of acres of crops left behind by the fleeing Rohingya, according to state government documents reviewed by Reuters. Myanmar also intends to settle most refugees who return to Rakhine state in new  model villages , rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach criticized in the past by the United Nations as effectively creating permanent camps. The government has not asked for help from any international agencies, who are calling for any repatriation to be voluntary and to the refugees  place of origin. The exodus of 589,000 Rohingya - and about 30,000 non-Muslims - from the conflict zone in northern Rakhine has left some 71,500 acres of planted rice paddy abandoned and in need of harvesting by January, according to plans drawn up by state officials. Tables in the documents, reviewed by Reuters, divide the land into paddy sown by  national races  - meaning Myanmar citizens - or  Bengalis,  a term widely used in Myanmar to refer to the Rohingya, but which they reject as implying they are illegal migrants from Bangladesh. Kyaw Lwin, the state minister, confirmed the plans, and said there was a total of 45,000 acres of  ownerless Bengali land . Two dozen combine harvesters operated by officials from the agriculture ministry will begin cutting stalks this month in areas under military control. The machines will be able to harvest about 14,400 acres according to official calculations contained in the plans. It is unclear what will become of the remaining crop, but officials told Reuters they would try to harvest all the paddy, recruiting additional labor to harvest manually if necessary. An acre of paddy in Myanmar typically makes more than $300 at market, meaning the state will gain millions of dollars worth of rice. The harvested rice will be transported to government stores, where it would either be donated to those displaced by the conflict or sold, Rakhine state secretary Tin Maung Swe told Reuters by phone.  The land was abandoned. There is no one to reap that, so the government ordered to harvest it,  he said. Human Rights Watch (HRW) deputy Asia director Phil Robertson, said the government should at least guarantee that the rice would be used for humanitarian support and not for profit.  You can t call a rice crop  ownerless  just because you used violence and arson to drive the owners out of the country,  he said. Many refugees are fearful to return and are skeptical of Myanmar s guarantees. Those who do decide to cross back into Myanmar will first be received at one of two centers, according to government plans reviewed by Reuters, before mostly being relocated to model villages. International donors, who have fed and cared for more than 120,000 mostly Rohingya  internally displaced persons  (IDPs) in supposedly temporary camps in Rakhine since violence in 2012, have told Myanmar that they will not support more camps, according to aid workers and diplomats.  The establishment of new temporary camps or camp-like settlements carries many risks, including that the returnees and IDPs could end up being confined to these camps for a long time,  said U.N. spokesman Stanislav Saling in an emailed response. Satellite imagery shows 288 villages, mostly Rohingya settlements, have been fully or partially razed by fires since Aug. 25, according to HRW.  Refugees say the army and Buddhist mobs were responsible for most of the arson. The government says Rohingya militants and even residents themselves burned the homes for propaganda. The hamlets where Rohingya farmers lived were  not systematic , and so should be rebuilt in smaller settlements of 1,000 households set out in straight rows to enable development, said Soe Aung, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement.  In some villages there are three houses here, four houses over there. For example, there s no road for fire engines when fire burns the villages,  Soe Aung said. Those who decide to cross back into Myanmar will first be received at one of two centers, according to government plans reviewed by Reuters. At the centers, officials said, the returnees will fill out a 16-point form that will be cross-checked with local authorities  records. Immigration officials have for years visited Rohingya households at least annually for checks, photographing family members. For refugees who lost all their documents, the government would compare their photos to those that immigration authorities have on file, said Myint Kyaing, the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population. Officials will accept as evidence  national verification  cards handed out in an ongoing government effort to register Rohingya that falls short of offering them citizenship. The card has been widely rejected by Rohingya community leaders, who say they treat life-long residents like new immigrants.  We are not going to go back like this,  said Mushtaq Ahmed, 57, a farmer from Myin Hlut village now living in the Tenkhali refugee camp in Bangladesh, where Jamil Ahmed is also staying.  If I can go back to my house, and get my land back, only then I will go. We invested all our money into those paddy fields. They are killing so many of us with swords and bullets, and killing the rest of us like this.  ",

        "text": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer accepted the resignation on Friday of his minister of political affairs, whose party is abandoning the ruling coalition to ready for the 2018 election. Antonio Imbassahy of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) has handled the government s relations with Congress, keeping an unwieldy coalition united in blocking the prosecution of Temer on corruption charges earlier this year. However the PSDB, Temer s largest ally, has split over whether to stick with the unpopular president in the run-up to a general election next October, when the party plans to field its own presidential candidate. The PSDB will hold its national convention in Brasilia on Saturday, when it is expected to elect Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin as its new party leader, replacing Senator Aecio Neves, who is under investigation for graft. That would make Alckmin the PSDB s most likely candidate in next year s presidential race. Allies say Alckmin plans to continue his party s disengagement from the Temer government, where the PSDB still has two ministers, including Foreign Minister Aloysio Nunes, who is expected to stay on the job based on personal conviction. Still, Alckmin is expected to mobilize PSDB support for Temer s signature legislation proposal, the overhaul of Brazil s costly social security system. Investors consider the measure crucial to closing a huge budget deficit that cost Latin America s largest economy its investment-grade credit rating. Temer needs the PSDB s 46 votes in the lower house of Congress to win passage of the pension reform bill, which is set for a vote the week of Dec. 18. ",

        "text": "DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzanian President John Magufuli has revealed he earns a salary of 9 million Tanzanian shillings ($4,000) per month, making him one of the lowest paid African leaders as he pursues a much-criticized policy of deep public spending cuts.  In a speech to local officials in the capital on Tuesday he also said his government had slashed salaries of executives at state-owned companies at 15 million Tanzanian shillings  ($6,700) a month   more than his own.   They can leave if they don t want it,  he said. He said abuse of public funds was  rampant  at state firms and that he had rejected requests from some local officials to more than double their allowances, saying he could not do so while many citizens lack access to water, health care and electricity. Since taking office in November 2015, Magufuli   nicknamed  the Bulldozer    has cut government spending by imposing measures such as restrictions on foreign travel for government officials and the removal of  ghost workers  from the state payroll.    Some critics say his cost-cutting measures are excessive and argue they could undermine growth in East Africa s second-biggest economy and some have slowed investment in critical sectors such as mining.  Magufuli s salary is a small fraction of that of other African leaders. He has no other publicly known sources of income and his government said last year it plans to submit a parliamentary bill that would prohibit public leaders from engaging in business to avoid conflicts of interest. By contrast Kenya s president earns a monthly salary of around $14,000. Jacob Zuma of South Africa is paid around $20,000 monthly, following a salary increase by parliament in 2015. Since 2009, Zuma has been embroiled in numerous scandals and allegations of abuse of office, including more than $500,000 of improper state spending on security at his private home. Others with more modest pay include President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, who took a 50 percent pay cut when he took office in May 2015. The annual presidential salary was previously set at 14.1 million naira, which in mid-2015 was the equivalent of $70,000.   ($1 = 2,239.0000 Tanzanian shillings) ",

        "title": "Vatican to Trump: It's not 'personal,' it's religion",
        "text": "MYRTLE BEACH, South Carolina (Reuters) - The Vatican on Friday tried to tamp down a firestorm ignited by Pope Francis\u2019 comments assailing Donald Trump\u2019s views on U.S. immigration as \u201cnot Christian\u201d, assuring the Republican presidential front-runner that it was not a personal attack or attempt to influence the U.S. campaign. Francis told reporters during a conversation on his flight home from Mexico on Thursday, \u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.\u201d Trump has said if elected president, he would build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to keep immigrants from illegally entering the United States.  Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi told Vatican Radio the pope\u2019s comments, in response to a reporter\u2019s question on Trump, were an affirmation of his longstanding belief that migrants should be helped and not shut out. He said the pope believed people \u201cshould build bridges, not walls\u201d. \u201cIn no way was this a personal attack, nor an indication of how to vote,\u201d Lombardi said.  Trump, who leads Republican candidates in opinion polls, lashed out on Thursday, dismissing the pope\u2019s remarks as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d for questioning his faith. \u201cIf and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS (Islamic State), which as everyone knows is ISIS\u2019 ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president,\u201d Trump said. Later, during a television appearance, he rowed back, calling Francis \u201ca wonderful guy.\u201d The extraordinary exchange between the billionaire real estate developer and leader of the world\u2019s 1.25 billion Roman Catholics, which occurred days before Saturday\u2019s Republican nominating contest in South Carolina, was headline news around the world. On Friday, New York\u2019s Daily News gave it the front page. Against a backdrop of an image of Trump, a headline blared: Anti Christ! The New York Post ran a front page photo of Trump and the pope wearing boxing gloves with the headline: Trump & pope: Bible belters.      It was unclear what, if any, effect the tussle might have on the vote in South Carolina, a conservative state that is home to many evangelical Protestant Christians. Patrick Hornbeck, chairman of the department of theology at Fordham University in New York, said on Thursday that Francis\u2019 words were not surprising given the poverty he had just seen in Mexico. \u201cThere is very little common ground between Pope Francis and Donald Trump,\u201d Hornbeck said. He predicted the pope\u2019s words on electoral politics would have little effect on any U.S. Catholics who liked Trump as a candidate. At a CNN town hall in Columbia, South Carolina, on Thursday night, Trump said he had \u201ca lot of respect\u201d for Francis but that the pope had been influenced by hearing only Mexico\u2019s side of the border issue. The pope\u2019s statement also had been exaggerated by the media, he said. \u201cI think he said something much softer than it was originally reported by the media,\u201d Trump said.  Earlier on Thursday, Thomas Groome, director of the Boston College Center on the Church in the 21st Century, said Francis\u2019 comments were entirely in keeping with his focus on mercy. \u201cThe pope is commissioned to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. That\u2019s his job,\u201d Groome said. \u201cSo when he was asked a direct question, he gave Trump the benefit of the doubt, he said we have to be sure he said this, but if he said this, it is not Christian.\u201d  (Reporting by Emily Flitter; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Toni Reinhold) This article was funded in part by SAP.

        "title": "Tillerson tightens the reins at State Department",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last month tightened his control over the State Department by taking back powers previously held by the top career foreign service officer, an action critics said would delay major decisions and marginalize career diplomats. The move retracted broad decision-making authority granted to the agency\u2019s third-highest ranking official, the undersecretary for political affairs, by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Most of those powers will be reserved instead for Tillerson and his deputy. Tillerson is broadly reviewing how authority is delegated, a State Department official said, which will \u201cresult in a streamlining of delegations, which will promote greater transparency, clarity and effectiveness in decision-making within the Department.\u201d  On July 17, Tillerson reversed Clinton\u2019s 2009 decision to empower the undersecretary for political affairs, currently career diplomat Thomas Shannon, with \u201call authorities and functions vested in the Secretary of State.\u201d Former officials said Clinton\u2019s delegation of authority was helpful in allowing decisions to be made quickly when she or her deputy were traveling abroad. \u201cEveryone travels all of the time if you\u2019re doing your job right as a diplomat,\u201d said a former State Department official who served during the Obama administration and requested anonymity. \u201cThere has to be some delegation of authority, or the work simply doesn\u2019t get done.\u201d Tillerson\u2019s decision came as most of the high-level positions at the State Department are either empty or filled by career officials in an \u201cacting\u201d capacity. The secretary has said he wants to be cautious about hiring while he is conducting a review of the State Department\u2019s organization. On Tuesday, Tillerson acknowledged to reporters that \u201cI have a lot of open slots,\u201d but said he had been able to accomplish a great deal \u201cbecause there are remarkable, talented professional foreign service officers in this building.\u201d But the slow pace of appointments has logjammed decision-making and resulted in a rank-and-file bureaucracy disconnected from top officials, diplomats and some members of Congress said.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the policies are, and the diplomats don\u2019t know what the policies are,\u201d Senator Ben Cardin, the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Tuesday. The second authority Tillerson took back from the undersecretary for political affairs in July was approval of State Department reports to Congress, which will now sit with the Office of Policy Planning, an internal State Department body usually headed by a political appointee. Unlike other senior officials, the office director and staff do not need Senate confirmation. The State Department is required by law to produce hundreds of reports for Congress each year, including on acts of terrorism, human rights conditions in different countries, countries\u2019 narcotics control strategies, the state of religious freedom around the world, and human trafficking. Typically, such reports are prepared by offices and embassies with expertise in the relevant issue, and are reviewed by the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Legislative Affairs and top aides to the secretary of state before being sent to Congress. Three former officials said giving the policy planning staff final sign-off on the reports could inject political considerations into their preparation. The undersecretary for political affairs is typically a career foreign service officer, and oversees seven regional bureaus. The move represents a \u201cpower grab\u201d by the policy planning body, said Eliot Cohen, who served as State Department counselor during former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. \u201cYou need a strong undersecretary for political affairs,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cYou can\u2019t run the State Department with a tiny office ... you need to go out and establish good working relationships with the professionals of the department.\u201d ",

The company also posted an advertisement for a manager for conservative outreach and public policy partnership, seeking a \u201cliaison to conservative, libertarian and free market groups.\u201d      While the position is not new, it gives Google a chance to make a hire that reflects the new political climate. Conservatives already are represented in the office. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment on the record for this article. Chief Executive Officer Larry Page of Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Google\u2019s parent company, is expected to be in the room on Wednesday when Trump convenes a gathering of leaders of some of the largest technology companies in his New York headquarters. The session, organized by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, adviser Reince Priebus and Trump supporter and tech financier Peter Thiel, is billed as an introductory meeting that would not result in any job or investment announcements, two sources briefed on the talks said. Others attending are Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, Facebook Inc (FB.O) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Amazon.com (AMZN.O) CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) CEO Satya Nadella and Oracle CEO Safra Catz, according to sources familiar with the session plans.  The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group whose members include Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, had a conference call last Friday to discuss policy objectives it could agree on to present to Trump, according to a person familiar with the call. Trump clashed with Silicon Valley on several issues during the election campaign, including immigration, government surveillance and encryption. His surprise victory alarmed many companies, which fear he might follow through on his pledges. Trump has also opposed the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules, ordered in 2015 by the communications regulator to reclassify broadband internet services to treat them more like public utilities. The rule is now said to be headed for a reversal. Liberal-leaning Silicon Valley bet heavily on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton winning the White House, and many technology companies have found themselves scrambling in the wake of Trump\u2019s election. But Google, which forged deep ties to the Obama White House and was the largest corporate contributor to Clinton\u2019s campaign, appears to have been caught especially off guard, Washington insiders said.  Only 33 employees of Google and its parent company Alphabet donated $201 or more to Trump, for a total of $23,300. Clinton received donations from 1,359 Google or Alphabet employees for a total of $1.6 million. Google NetPAC, the company\u2019s political action committee, made 56 percent of its contributions to Republicans in the 2016 election cycle, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. During Obama\u2019s presidency, more than 250 people moved between jobs at Google or related firms and the federal government, national political campaigns and Congress, according to a report this year by the Campaign for Accountability, a watchdog group. The company notched several wins during the administration, including favorable policies on net neutrality.  Google seemed poised to enjoy similar treatment under a Clinton administration. Schmidt was seen wearing a staff badge at Clinton\u2019s election night party, a sign of their close relationship. But those ties are now something of a liability as the company tries to re-position its presence, lobbyists said. The hiring push will adjust the political makeup of Google\u2019s Washington office, where the team of lobbyists for Congress and the agencies contains more Democrats than Republicans, according to people familiar with the operation. Such a skew is not unusual given that Democrats controlled the White House the past eight years. To be sure, conservatives are well-represented in the company\u2019s Washington office: Susan Molinari, a former Republican congresswoman from New York, has been the top lobbyist since 2012, and Seth Webb, who worked for a former Republican speaker of the house, helps lead Congressional lobbying.  But the company has tended toward moderate Republicans in past hiring. Its previous director of conservative outreach was alumnus of Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, and a number of former staffers for Sen. John McCain have passed through the office as well. But the company still has to reconcile the lobbyists it hires with its liberal-leaning existing staff. Said one lobbyist for a rival tech company, \u201cI think they are going to have a tough time really finding the cultural fit.\u201d ",

        "title": "German broadcasters won't promote ex-Pink Floyd frontman's concerts over anti-Semitism accusations",
        "text": " (This November 28 story has been corrected to clarify in headline, lead and third paragraph that the broadcasters will not promote the concerts, not that they had dropped plans to air the concerts) BERLIN (Reuters) - German public broadcasters have dropped plans to promote concerts next year by British ex-Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters, citing what they call  accusations of anti-Semitism against him . Waters, part of one of the world s most critically acclaimed and commercially successful rock bands from 1965-85 before going solo, is a member of the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement (BDS) that targets Israel over its occupation of territories where Palestinians seek statehood.   Five state television and radio affiliates of the national ARD network have said they will not promote concerts by the 74-year-old Waters in Berlin and Cologne scheduled next summer  in reaction to anti-Semitism accusations against him , Berlin and Brandenburg public radio (RBB) said. RBB, part of the ARD network, said it wanted to send a message to other artists who, heeding the BDS, refuse to perform in Israel. Waters joined the movement in 2011.  Taking a clear position here is an important signal for RBB to the Jewish communities in Berlin and Brandenburg,  RBB director Patricia Schlesinger said in a statement.  The quick and decisive reaction by the broadcasters ...is an important signal that rampant anti-Semitism against Israel `has no place in Germany,  said Josef Schuster, president of The Central Council of Jews in Germany.  Marek Lieberberg, Waters  tour director, said that German Jews were right to be concerned about  clearly visible and growing anti-Semitism  in Germany - alluding to the far right s surge in recent German elections - but that the broadcasters  decision was  absolutely ridiculous .   Lieberberg, the son of Holocaust survivors, told the Mannheimer Morgen daily that while he rejected the BDS, he separates personal opinions from work.  I cannot and do not want to deny (Waters) his right to freedom of opinion,  he said.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s right-wing government has long campaigned against the BDS, describing it as anti-Semitic and an attempt to erase Israel s legitimacy. The movement, launched in 2005 as a non-violent campaign to press Israel to heed international law and end its occupation of territory held since a 1967 war, has gathered momentum in recent years even if its economic impact remains negligible. Germany has long sought to distance itself from the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust and become one of Israel s closest allies. ",

        "title": "Silicon Valley mocks Trump over his tech bubble warning",
        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that a dangerous financial bubble has formed in the technology industry - and Silicon Valley responded with a collective eye roll.  In a Reuters interview, the New York billionaire said technology start-ups that had never earned a profit were able to sell shares at very high prices, likening the situation to the overheated stock market in 2007. \u201cI\u2019m talking about companies that have never made any money, that have a bad concept and that are valued at billions of dollars, so here we go again,\u201d Trump said. Many tech watchers have repeatedly warned of a tech bubble as the number of private companies valued at $1 billion or more - known as unicorns - have soared to 163, according to venture capital research firm CB Insights. So Trump\u2019s declaration, in the eyes of Silicon Valley\u2019s entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, was nothing new. Investors and others took to Twitter to poke fun at Trump\u2019s campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d by repeating the phrase, \u201cMake Bubbles Great Again.\u201d     \u201cFINALLY someone calls it out,\u201d Marc Andreessen, a general partner at the prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, tweeted, mocking Trump. In the interview, Trump said the high valuations that tech start-ups are able to fetch today remind him of 2007, when an overheated housing market helped drive U.S. stocks to unsustainable valuations before the bubble burst. \u201cYou have a stock market that is very strange,\u201d the presumptive Republican nominee said. \u201cYou look at some of these tech stocks that are so, so weak as a concept and a company, and they\u2019re selling for so much money. And I would have said can that ever happen again? I think that could happen again.\u201d Some startup founders rejected Trump\u2019s generalization that all companies are burning cash and overvalued; certainly many of them are, and in the last several months a correction has started to rectify years of exuberant investments.  Still, other companies continue to raise money successfully and turn profits. \u201cSo far he has been saying dumb things but they seem to be getting dumber and dumber,\u201d Vivek Wadhwa, an entrepreneur and Stanford University fellow, told Reuters. \u201cI was going to tweet (the comments) while calling Peter Thiel and saying, \u2018Here is your buddy.\u2019\u201d Thiel, an influential investor well-known for his contrarian ideas, is one of the few Silicon Valley leaders to openly support Trump. Thiel was not immediately available for comment. \u201cThere is nothing in his (Trump\u2019s) track record to show that he has been out here and met with any technology leaders and knows this industry and knows about innovation,\u201d said Aaron Ginn, co-founder of the Lincoln Initiative, a community that promotes libertarian and technology-friendly values.  Which is ironic, Ginn said, given how much technology - especially Twitter - has helped Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cHe says things and does things that are made for entertainment,\u201d Ginn said.

        "text": "COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lankan monks and hardline nationalists protesters forced 31 Rohingya Muslim asylum seekers to flee a United Nations safe house in the capital Colombo on Tuesday, police said.  The refugees, who were arrested in April along with two suspected Indian traffickers in a boat in Sri Lankan seas, were taken into protective custody and then to a detention center outside Colombo, police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said. A live telecast on the Facebook page of Sinhale Jathika Balamuluwa, a hardline nationalist group, showed the Buddhist monks and some civilians storming the safe house chanting  do not allow terrorists into this country.  The Rohingya group fled Myanmar in 2012 and lived in India as refugees for nearly five years before trying to migrate illegally, a lawyer representing them told Reuters.  A local court later handed them over to UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC). UNHRC officials were not immediately available for comment.  These Rohingyans are a group of terrorists. They have slaughtered our Buddhist monks in Myanmar,  Akmeemana Dayarathne a Buddhist monk who led the protest told the gathering. Tens of thousands Muslim Rohingya have fled mostly Buddhist Myanmar since 2012. Tension between majority Buddhists and Rohingya, most of whom are denied citizenship, has simmered for decades in Rakhine, but it has exploded several times over the past few years, as old enmities, and Buddhist nationalism, surfaced with the end of decades of harsh military rule. About 69,000 Rohingyas have fled to Bangladesh since October, straining relations between the two neighbors who each see the stateless Muslim minority as the other nation s problem. ",

        "title": "Brexit crisis tops off rough stretch in Obama's push for legacy",
        "text": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - The financial and political fallout from Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union has added to a string of setbacks for President Barack Obama as he works to burnish his legacy before his presidency ends in January 2017. The Brexit decision came after a deadlock in the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday effectively ended Obama\u2019s push to overhaul immigration rules, and the week after the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. For Obama, the reversals heighten pressure on him and fellow Democrats to work harder for the Nov. 8 elections - particularly for the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, who represents his best shot at making sure more of his policies are not rolled back. Speaking at two fundraising events in Seattle on Friday night, at the end of an arduous day that saw global markets plunge after the Brexit vote, Obama acknowledged the shifting political winds four months from the vote. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t think the stakes were high before, you should think the stakes are pretty high right now,\u201d Obama said at an intimate fundraising dinner at the home of tech executive Steve Singh. Guests, arranged in two long tables, paid $10,000 to $66,800 per couple. Obama has argued technology and globalization can increase opportunities for all, but conceded that recent events show many people are frightened by global competition and feel left behind. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and political novice, has tapped into those concerns about the economy, trade and immigration - fears that also figured into the UK campaign to leave the EU. \u201cUnfortunately, when people are anxious and scared, there are going to be politicians out there who try to prey on that frustration to get themselves headlines and to get themselves votes,\u201d Obama told about 3,000 people who paid $250 and up to attend a campaign-style event on Friday for Washington State\u2019s Democratic Governor Jay Inslee. Clinton regained a double-digit lead over Trump this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday that showed 46.6 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton while 33.3 percent backed Trump. In April, Obama had taken the unusual step of traveling to London to help the \u201cRemain\u201d camp of the referendum for his friend and ally, Prime Minister David Cameron, who will now leave office before Obama does. The financial uncertainty from Brexit threatens to weigh on the strong U.S. economy and undo some of the recovery seen since Obama took office in early 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. Earlier this week, Obama\u2019s plan to remove the specter of deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants was quashed when the Supreme Court deadlocked over lifting a hold on the action. And two weeks ago, the nation\u2019s worst mass shooting in modern history, at a gay nightclub in Orlando, raised questions about how Obama is dealing with home-grown extremism - and served as a reminder of his failure to convince the U.S. Congress to tighten gun laws. The setbacks show the limits of action that any president can take unilaterally, said Justin Vaughn, a political scientist at Boise State University. \u201cI don\u2019t think Obama\u2019s legacy has taken a hit so much as it came back to earth,\u201d Vaughn said. Still, the impression that his administration is unable to control its own political destiny could weigh on how history views Obama\u2019s time at the White House, said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist at University of Houston.     \u201cPresidents are often judged by what happens in the ninth inning, so President Obama\u2019s last few months in office are important to cementing and enhancing his legacy,\u201d Rottinghaus said.

        "title": "Women accusing Trump of sexual misconduct seek congressional probe",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three women who have accused U.S. President Donald Trump of sexual misconduct called on Monday for a congressional investigation into his behavior amid a wave of similar accusations against prominent men in Hollywood, the media and politics. Over the past two years, more than a dozen women have accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them years before he entered politics. Three of his accusers, Jessica Leeds, Rachel Crooks, and Samantha Holvey said at a news conference on Monday that the accusations warranted new consideration given the broader discussion of sexual harassment in U.S. society. Brave New Films, a nonprofit filmmaker, produced a video featuring 16 of Trump\u2019s accusers and organized the news conference in New York on Monday. In the film, women accused  Trump of kissing them without permission, grabbing their private parts, putting his hand up their skirts, or making other unwanted advances.  Congress should \u201cput aside their party affiliations and investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s history of sexual misconduct,\u201d said Crooks, a former receptionist for a real estate firm, who was flanked by Leeds and Holvey.  The women said they do not think Trump will resign over the allegations but that he should be held accountable. Trump and White House officials have denied the allegations, some of which date back to the 1980s. \u201cThese false claims, totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts, were addressed at length during last year\u2019s campaign, and the American people voiced their judgment by delivering a decisive victory,\u201d a White House spokesperson said in a statement on Monday, questioning the women\u2019s timing and political motives.\u00a0 Trump, a Republican, faces legal action in one related case. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand told CNN that Trump should resign over the accusations.  \u201cThese allegations are credible,\u201d Gillibrand said in an interview on Monday with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour. \u201cThey are numerous. I\u2019ve heard these women\u2019s testimony, and many of them are heartbreaking.\u201d Gillibrand recently said former President Bill Clinton, a fellow Democrat, should have stepped down during the 1990s scandal that led the House of Representatives to vote to impeach him. On Monday, she said that if Trump does not immediately resign, Congress \u201cshould have appropriate investigations of his behavior and hold him accountable.\u201d A number of powerful and high-profile men have been accused in recent months of sexual misconduct, including three members of Congress, Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein and former NBC news anchor Matt Lauer. Reuters has not independently verified the accusations against Trump, Weinstein, Lauer or the three congressmen. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and  one of the most high-profile women in Trump\u2019s administration, said on Sunday that any woman who has felt mistreated by a man has the right to speak up, even if she is accusing the president. Democrat Chris Coons, a member of the Senate Judiciary panel, said it was unlikely that the Republican-controlled Congress would act on the accusations, which were known before the November 2016 presidential election. \u201cMy hunch is it gets reviewed at the next election,\u201d Coons told CNN. Sexual harassment accusations have also been made against Republican candidate Roy Moore who is running in a U.S. Senate race this week in Alabama. Trump has backed Moore, a former judge, even as congressional Republicans denounced the candidate and called on him to pull out of the race.  The accusations against Trump emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign when a videotape surfaced of a 2005 conversation caught on an open microphone in which Trump spoke in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with women. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trump apologized for the remarks, but called them private \u201clocker-room talk\u201d and said he had not done the things he talked about.

        "text": " WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cwall\u201d along the U.S.-Mexico border would be a series of fences and walls that would cost as much as $21.6 billion, and take more than three years to construct, based on a U.S. Department of Homeland Security internal report seen by Reuters on Thursday.  The report\u2019s estimated price-tag is much higher than a $12-billion figure cited by Trump in his campaign and estimates as high as $15 billion from Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.  MORE TOP NEWS: Twitter numbers paint grim profitability picture Trump changes tack, backs 'one China' policy in call with Xi The report is expected to be presented to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John Kelly in coming days, although the administration will not necessarily take actions it recommends.  The plan lays out what it would take to seal the border in three phases of construction of fences and walls covering just over 1,250 miles (2,000 km) by the end of 2020.  With 654 miles (1,046 km) of the border already fortified, the new construction would extend almost the length of the entire border.  Many cost estimates and timelines have been floated since Trump campaigned on the promise of building a wall. The report seen by Reuters is the work of a group commissioned by Kelly as a final step before moving forward with requesting U.S. taxpayer funds from Congress and getting started on construction.  A DHS spokeswoman said the department does \u201cnot comment on or confirm the potential existence of pre-decisional, deliberative documents.\u201d  A White House spokeswoman said it would be \u201cpremature\u201d to comment on a report that has not officially been presented to the president.  DON\u2019T MISS: Japan's love of tiny cars sore spot as for Trump Exclusive: In call with Putin, Trump denounced Obama-era nuclear arms treaty The report said the first phase would be the smallest, targeting sections covering 26 miles (42 km) near San Diego, California; El Paso, Texas; and in Texas\u2019s Rio Grande Valley.  The report assumes DHS would get funding from Congress by April or May, giving the department sufficient time to secure contractors and begin construction by September. Trump has said Congress should fund the wall upfront, but that Mexico will reimburse U.S. taxpayers. Mexico has said it will not pay.  Several U.S. congressional delegations are visiting the border this month to assess funding needs, according to several people familiar with the travel plans.  The report shows the U.S. government has begun seeking waivers to address environmental laws on building in some areas. It also shows the government has begun working with existing contractors and planning steel purchases for the project.  Trump told law enforcement officials on Wednesday, \u201cThe wall is getting designed right now.\u201d  The report accounted for the time and cost of acquiring private land, one reason for its steep price increase compared to estimates from Trump and members of Congress.  Bernstein Research, an investment research group that tracks material costs, has said that uncertainties around the project could drive its cost up to as much as $25 billion.  The second phase of construction proposed in the report would cover 151 miles (242 km) of border in and around the Rio Grande Valley; Laredo, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; El Paso, Texas and Big Bend, Texas. The third phase would cover an unspecified 1,080 miles (1,728 km), essentially sealing off the entire U.S.-Mexico border.  The report lays out costs to cover the border with barriers, but funding constraints and legal battles are likely to place limits on those plans.  It also does not account for major physical barriers, like mountains, in areas where it would not be feasible to build.  A source familiar with the plans said DHS may have to go to court to seek eminent domain in order to acquire some of the private land needed to cover the final and most ambitious phase.  The first phase, estimated to cost only $360 million, could be a relatively easy way for Trump to satisfy supporters eager to see him make good on his campaign promises to limit illegal migration. But the rest of the construction will be markedly more expensive, covering a much larger stretch of land, much of it privately owned or inaccessible by road.  In addition to seeking eminent domain and environmental waivers, the U.S. government would also have to meet the requirements of the International Boundary and Water Commission, a U.S.-Mexico pact over shared waters. The report estimated that agreement alone could bring the cost from $11 million per mile to $15 million per mile in one area.  ",

        "text": "HOUSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top executive at the company behind the embattled Dakota Access Pipeline has donated more than $100,000 to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump since June, according to campaign finance disclosure records. The donations by Kelcy Warren, chairman and chief executive officer at pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners, support the candidate seen by many as more likely to promote the U.S. oil and gas industry than his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Warren donated $300 to the Trump campaign during the primaries, and $2,700 to Trump during the general election phase of the campaign, for the maximum contribution allowed by a single individual during an election.  He also gave $100,000 to the Trump Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee that includes the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee, the Republican Party of Arkansas and the Connecticut Republican Party.  The donations, first reported by the British newspaper The Guardian, were made before the U.S. government halted construction on a segment of Energy Transfer Partners\u2019 1,100-mile (1,770-km) Dakota Access Pipeline in early September following protests by Native American and environmental groups.  The project, which would move oil from the highly productive Bakken shale formation to the Midwest and Gulf Coast, sparked violent clashes between security officers near the construction site and Native American tribe members and other protesters. Opponents have said the project will damage burial sites considered sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and pollute the area\u2019s drinking water.  Warren has also given $66,800 to the Republication National Committee since Trump secured the nomination for the Nov. 8 election, The Guardian reported. Trump has not yet taken a position on the Dakota Access Pipeline, but supports the development of oil and gas and related infrastructure, including pipelines. Asked about Trump\u2019s position on the Dakota Access Pipeline in a policy debate this week, U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, one of the candidate\u2019s main energy advisers, declined to answer, saying he did not want to get ahead of Trump. He added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure he (Trump) is aware of it.\u201d  If elected, Trump in his first 100 days will ask TransCanada to renew its permit application for the Keystone XL Pipeline, according to his campaign website. U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the proposed pipeline from Canada last November. Trump has holdings in Energy Transfer Partners and Phillips 66, a joint owner of the Dakota Access Pipeline, through mutual funds, according to financial disclosure records. U.S. oil and gas industry workers have contributed slightly more to Clinton, with employees giving $114,141 to the Democratic candidate and $99,302 to Trump since July, according to a Reuters review of federal campaign finance disclosures.

        "title": "No U.S.-Russia cyber unit without Trump notifying Congress, bill says",
        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump would be required to notify U.S. lawmakers before creating a joint U.S.-Russia cyber security unit - an idea that has drawn criticism across the political spectrum - under legislation advancing in Congress.  The proposal, if it became law, would be the latest in a series of maneuvers by Congress that either limit the president\u2019s authority on Russia matters or rebuke his desire to warm relations with Moscow. A provision contained within the annual Intelligence Authorization Act and passed by the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee 14-1 would require the Trump administration to provide Congress with a report describing what intelligence would be shared with Russia, any counterintelligence concerns and how those concerns would be addressed. The bill, which grants congressional approval for clandestine operations carried out by the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies, passed the Senate Intelligence Committee in July, but its text was only recently made public because it involves sensitive intelligence operations.     Trump last month said on Twitter that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had discussed establishing \u201can impenetrable Cyber Security unit\u201d to address issues like the risk of cyber meddling in elections. Trump quickly backpedaled on the idea, which was criticized by Democrats, senior Republicans and the National Security Agency director. The White House and Senator Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the intelligence panel, were not immediately available for comment on the bill. Trump wants to improve relations with Russia, a desire that has been hamstrung by the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Republican Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton.  U.S. congressional panels and a special counsel are investigating the interference and possible collusion between Russia and members of Trump\u2019s campaign. Moscow has denied any meddling and Trump has denied any collusion. Previously, Congress tied the president\u2019s hands on Russia by passing a bill that Trump cannot ease the sanctions against Russia unless he seeks congressional approval. In August, the Senate blocked Trump from being able to make recess appointments while lawmakers were on break, fearing the president would fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his handling of the Russian probe. Lawmakers have also introduced legislation to stop Trump from having the ability to fire Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed to determine whether there was collusion between Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and Moscow. The annual Intelligence Authorization Act requires approval by the full Senate and House and the president\u2019s signature before it can become law. No vote has been scheduled and the last act was passed by Congress in March.  The legislation\u2019s provision requiring notification of any U.S.-Russia cybersecurity unit was pushed by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, his office said on Tuesday. Wyden also helped secure provisions in the bill that call for an intelligence report assessing the threat posed to the United States by Russian money laundering and another report examining whether cyber vulnerabilities in U.S. cell networks, including a known bug in the global mobile network Signaling System No. 7, or SS7, are being exploited by foreign governments to conduct surveillance on Americans. Wyden was the lone committee vote against the bill, however.  He said in a statement on Tuesday that he objected to language that identified the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks as a \u201cnon-state hostile intelligence service\u201d because doing so could have implications for journalists. (This version of the story was refiled to correct \u201cconclusion\u201d to \u201ccollusion\u201d in paragraph 9) ",

        "title": "Driven up the wall by Trump, Mexico looks to recast image in U.S.",
        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - At first, Mexico\u2019s government did its best to ignore Donald Trump. Then it likened him to Adolf Hitler. Now it has appointed a new ambassador to come up with a better plan. Fed up with the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination labeling Mexico as a cradle of drug-runners, job poachers and rapists, the government is sending in respected diplomat Carlos Sada to lead a fightback. Mexico\u2019s new ambassador in Washington, Sada acknowledges his country has neglected its image across the border and aims to fix that with PR and media campaigns, and by lobbying prominent U.S. companies, lawmakers and civic leaders. \u201cWe need to do a more thorough job so that people understand what (Mexico) contributes,\u201d he said after he was sworn in at Mexico\u2019s Senate on Thursday. Sada\u2019s strategy includes underscoring Mexico\u2019s importance to the U.S. economy, although it centers on defending the rights of Mexican citizens in the United States and promoting Mexican culture. That focus has fed doubts over whether the government is trying hard enough to win over its most important audience: American voters. \u201cIt\u2019s vital to improve Mexico\u2019s image and protect our people, but that\u2019s not enough to change the hateful trend that Trump and other xenophobes before him have stirred up,\u201d said Gabriela Cuevas, an opposition lawmaker who chairs the Senate\u2019s foreign relations committee. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the extent of the damage Trump has done,\u201d she said, urging the government to be more aggressive in mobilizing powerful U.S. interests against Trump\u2019s attacks. Claiming Mexico is \u201ckilling\u201d the United States on trade, Trump has threatened to disrupt bilateral commerce worth some $500 billion a year, and promises to deport millions of undocumented migrants from Mexico and Central America. To finance a border wall to keep migrants out, he has controversially proposed blocking billions of dollars in remittances sent home by Mexicans in the United States. The measures would pose a serious threat to Mexico\u2019s economy, but for months Mexico\u2019s government disregarded Trump, hoping his candidacy would fizzle out. \u201cIt\u2019s the ostrich policy: head in the sand,\u201d said Agustin Barrios Gomez, the head of Fundacion Imagen Mexico, a group dedicated to promoting Mexico\u2019s image abroad. Mexican officials say U.S. politicians and officials urged it to keep a low profile to avoid aggravating tensions, and played down the real estate magnate\u2019s chances. \u201cThe Republicans told us, \u2018We\u2019ll deal with Trump\u2019,\u201d one senior Mexican government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. When Mexico eventually did respond, President Enrique Pena Nieto compared the brash billionaire\u2019 s campaign to the rise of Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Mexican officials wince with embarrassment when reminded of the comment, arguing it was tactless and went too far. As Trump railed against Mexico, the government should have made a concerted effort to remind key players in the United States that the two nations\u2019 economic interests are closely intertwined, diplomats and business leaders say. But over a dozen serving and former senior Mexican officials and lawmakers consulted by Reuters said it did not. \u201cThey haven\u2019t so far, but I do see the intention to do it again,\u201d said Jaime Serra, a former trade minister who headed Mexico\u2019s negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada in the early 1990s.  Trump has not been the only one to criticize Mexico. His Republican rival Ted Cruz also supports a border wall, and backs mass deportations of illegal immigrants. Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders has, like Trump, taken a protectionist line on jobs and says NAFTA was a mistake.  Mexico\u2019s cause was not helped by Pena Nieto leaving his diplomatic mission in Washington without an ambassador for six months just as Trump was warming up. And his eventual choice surprised many: Miguel Basanez, an old friend who had never worked in the diplomatic service. \u201cIt was a bad decision from the start,\u201d said a senior lawmaker inside Pena Nieto\u2019s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. \u201cThey didn\u2019t grasp the size of the problem.\u201d Basanez was cast aside this month, just seven months into the job.  For Basanez and now Sada, the task of promoting Mexico in the United States is complicated by problems at home. Mexico\u2019s reputation has been hurt by relentless drugs violence, conflict-of-interest scandals in government and the apparent massacre of 43 trainee teachers by a drug cartel working with local police. \u201cTo change the image, you have to change the reality,\u201d said Andres Rozental, a former deputy foreign minister responsible for North America. \u201cUnfortunately, Mexico\u2019s internal reality at this point in time has a lot of negatives.\u201d ",

        "title": "Chinese fans prepare to welcome rich, powerful, 'free-spirit' Trump",
        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - He may be a divisive figure back home, but U.S. President Donald Trump will be landing in friendly territory when he arrives in Beijing on Wednesday, judging by Chinese social media. On platforms such as the Twitter-like Sina Weibo, Trump s Chinese supporters, who admire his business success and a free-wheeling style unconstrained by political correctness, are far more prominent than detractors. While no comprehensive survey has been done to assess the size and intensity of Trump s popularity in China, several pundits suggest he has broad and vocal support.  Chinese people are impressed that he is extremely rich, he loves things splendid and magnificent, and he loves to show off. Not every billionaire is like that,  said Yin Hao, who translates American news and comedy clips for his nearly one million followers on Weibo.     Yin said his translated Trump-related video clips sometimes attract thousands of comments, where some supporters engage in name-calling and invective in defending the president.  They will keep posting comments to defend Trump, mock his opponents under all news clips that involve Trump, and rebuke any comments that are not in favor of Trump,  Yin said. Chen Jibing, a Shanghai-based political commentator, said Trump s Chinese fan base is different than that for previous foreign leaders such as his predecessor, Barack Obama, and for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who enjoyed widespread but tepid support.  Chinese Trump fans are seriously and truly invested, and you had better not make light of offending them,  Chen wrote in a social media post to his millions of followers. While Trump encountered protests during his visits to Japan and South Korea on the first two legs of his 12-day Asian tour, such scenes are unlikely in China, which tightly controls public gatherings, with media and the internet subject to censorship. China s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said Trump will receive a  state visit-plus  experience in Beijing. He is expected to go to the Forbidden City and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops, though China has released few other details. Trump s popularity in China largely comes from his disdain for political correctness and defiance of traditional liberal western views, which many Chinese consider elitist and unrealistic, Chen said. His criticism of the U.S. trade deficit with China, for example, is seen by many in the country as standard U.S. political talk, some pundits say.     In China, realists hold a deep-rooted belief that the rule of the jungle means the strong prey on the weak,  Chen said.  For them, the world is not split into right and wrong, good or evil, it is only success or failure, the powerful and the weak.   Factual errors or gaffes by Trump tend to be ignored by his Chinese fans or explained away as harmless mistakes made by a leader who writes his own rules. In Japan on Monday, Trump told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the Japanese economy was not performing as well as the United States  and appeared to mistakenly say that Japan s economy was the world s second-largest. It is actually third, after China s. An editor at a major state publication told Reuters was inclined to be forgiving about Trump s remark to Abe:  He s a free spirit. No one can tell him what to do.    Many on Chinese social media see Trump as a figure of fun.  Rather than being a president, Trump is more like a comedian!  one Weibo user wrote. In a country where parents are traditionally judged by the success of their children, Trump scores extra points for his daughter Ivanka, a businesswoman and currently advisor to President Trump, and her Mandarin-speaking children. One Chinese state publication said that all five of Trump s children are a testament to his character.  You can tell what parents are like through their childrens  success. Trump s five children are all excellent, it means he is a very successful father,  the China Education Daily said on its social media account. Ivanka Trump is sometimes referred to as  goddess  on Chinese social media, where some were upset that the first daughter would not be accompanying her father to Beijing.  SAD! Ivanka is not coming to China,  said Jiang Xiaofeng, a journalist with Phoenix TV on Sina Weibo, appropriating one of Donald Trump s favorite Twitter exclamations.  ",

        "title": "Trump aides divided over policy shielding 'dreamer' immigrants: sources",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Divisions have emerged among advisers to President Donald Trump over whether to rescind a signature policy of his predecessor, President Barack Obama, that shields young immigrants from deportation, according to congressional sources and Republicans close to the White House. Even though Trump campaigned on a promise to roll back Obama\u2019s executive orders on immigration, the Republican has so far left intact an order safeguarding 750,000 people who were brought to the United States illegally as children, known as the \u201cdreamers.\u201d The issue has become a flashpoint for White House advisers divided between a more moderate faction such as chief of staff Reince Priebus and immigration hardliners Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon, said a former congressional aide who has been  involved with immigration issues in Washington.      Priebus has said publicly that Trump will work with Congress to get a \u201clong-term solution\u201d on the issue.  Meanwhile, Miller, said to have mastered the thinking of his former boss and anti-immigration advocate Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s nominee for U.S. Attorney General, as well as Bannon, former head of right-wing Breitbart News, have pushed Trump to take a harder approach and rescind the protections.  Two officials at the Department of Homeland Security expect Trump to simply stop renewing the authorizations that \u201cdreamers\u201d currently have to work, drive and obtain higher education. Under that plan, the most recently renewed authorizations would expire in two years.   But a senior House Republican aide said it was uncertain whether the administration had scrapped the idea of overturning Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA, as the internal debate plays out.   Preserving DACA has also become somewhat of a bartering chip as Trump seeks congressional support for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and other early administration priorities. The White House is \u201cacutely aware\u201d of the firestorm in the country and within Congress that could swamp the fledgling administration just as it plunges into negotiations over the wall, healthcare, tax reform and infrastructure investments, said the senior House Republican aide. Another congressional aide described a Senate bill sponsored by Democrat Dick Durbin and Republican Lindsey Graham to protect the \u201cdreamers\u201d as the \u201csugar that would help the medicine of the wall go down.\u201d  The bill would likely face challenges winning enough votes to pass. Efforts to attach some tough conservative amendments could lose Democratic Party support and sink the whole effort.  Trump has kept his public comments on DACA vague. In an interview with ABC News on Wednesday, Trump said his administration would be coming out with a policy to deal with \u201cdreamers\u201d over the next four weeks.  \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be very worried. They are here illegally. They shouldn\u2019t be very worried. I do have a big heart. We\u2019re going to take care of everybody. We\u2019re going to have a very strong border,\u201d Trump said in the interview with ABC.  Trump reportedly told Durbin during the inaugural luncheon at the Capitol on Jan. 20 that he did not have to worry about an executive action overturning Obama\u2019s order. But there is scant trust among Democrats that Trump will keep his word. And immigration advocates said DACA recipients live in fear and uncertainty as the message from the White House and Republicans seems to shift by the day.     House Speaker Paul Ryan told a woman protected by DACA, at a townhall hosted by CNN Jan. 12, that there should be a solution for people like her to get \u201cright with the law\u201d and not be separated from their families.  Just two days prior, Sessions, a Senator, told a Senate panel considering his confirmation that it would \u201ccertainly be constitutional\u201d to repeal DACA. Sessions also attempted to force a vote to block DACA in the Senate in 2014.  Miller, Sessions\u2019 former staffer, is now Trump\u2019s senior adviser for policy at the White House.  Miller is known to be a staunch advocate for restricting immigration, even by workers who enter legally on visas.  Both Miller and Bannon, Trump\u2019s senior counselor and chief strategist, are seen as outsiders to the Republican establishment and unafraid to upset people like Ryan to stay true to Trump campaign promises. Priebus, however, came to the White House after chairing the Republican National Committee and has spent years seeking to unify the party and cultivating relationships with career politicians. ",

        "title": "Congress forecasters see major savings from sentencing reforms",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A criminal justice bill awaiting a vote by the U.S. Senate would reduce federal prison costs by $722 million over the next 10 years by releasing thousands of federal prisoners early, congressional forecasters said on Wednesday. Federal benefits received by the newly released prisoners would increase direct spending by $251 million and reduce revenues by $8 million over the same period, according to the estimate by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office. The new savings estimate buoyed supporters of the bipartisan measure to lower mandatory minimum sentences for some non-violent federal drug offenders, which is central to President Barack Obama\u2019s efforts to overhaul the country\u2019s federal criminal justice system and reduce prison overcrowding.  \u201cWe have an obligation to change the way we think about incarceration, and today\u2019s CBO report shows that we have a fiscal obligation as well,\u201d said the bill\u2019s co-authors, U.S. senators Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, and Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, in a statement. The bill was revised last month to exclude prisoners convicted of violent crimes in an effort to garner more support among conservatives.  Still, its prospects for moving to a full Senate vote remain unclear. Some key Republican senators are reluctant to support the bill until it includes changes to \u201cmens rea\u201d laws that govern criminal intent.  Parallel sentencing reforms await a floor vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. A White House study last month found that current sentencing and incarceration policies strain state budgets, take people out of the work force and pull families apart more than they reduce crime or boost the U.S. economy.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government might expand a ban on larger electronics like laptops in airplane cabins to flights originating from dozens of airports in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the head of Homeland Security said on Wednesday, though an expansion could be avoided if countries agree to improved security procedures. The U.S. restrictions imposed in March currently cover about 350 flights a week originating from 10 airports, primarily in the Middle East. Extending the ban to all European airports that directly serve U.S. airports would affect nearly 400 flights a day and cover 30 million travelers and pose major logistical challenges, airlines and security officials say. \u201cWe are looking right now at an additional 71 airports,\u201d Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly told a House of Representatives panel. \u201cWe\u2019re also looking at ways that we think we can mitigate the threat\u201d without expanding the ban. Kelly said his deputy will attend a conference in Malta next week \u201cto present what we think are the minimum increased security standards ... and present those to people to say if you meet these standards we will not ban large electronics.\u201d The restrictions on laptops announced in March, including on flights originating from airports in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, came amid fears that a concealed bomb could be installed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. Britain quickly followed suit with restrictions on a slightly different set of routes. Kelly said many countries are working to not be added to the ban list by improving screening to \u201cdetect this very sophisticated device.\u201d He called the danger real. \u201cThis is a very serious constant threat to knock down an airplane,\u201d Kelly said. Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan declined to identify the 71 airports that are under consideration. Any move to restrict carrying larger electronics to the cargo hold of aircraft has potential safety implications related to past problems with laptop batteries. Kelly said he is reviewing those concerns. U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao at a Senate hearing on Wednesday said lithium ion batteries on airplanes can be a problem. \u201cThis is a difficult issue that the administration is grappling with especially from a security point of view,\u201d Chao said. A laptop fire in a cabin can be detected quickly, versus a device stored in a cargo hold. On May 30, a New York JetBlue Airways Corp flight bound for San Francisco was diverted to Michigan because of a lithium battery fire from a passenger laptop in the airplane cabin. ",

        "title": "War-ravaged South Sudan may scrap expensive oil subsidies",
        "text": "JUBA (Reuters) - War-ravaged South Sudan is considering scrapping state subsidies on oil because it hasn t been able to pay civil servants for four months and diplomatic staff abroad are being evicted over unpaid rent, the deputy finance minister said.  Ending the subsidies would free up desperately needed cash, Mou Ambrose Thiik told Reuters in an interview.  Nearly four years of civil war have destroyed South Sudan s economy. Inflation was at 165 percent in August, the 21st consecutive month of triple-digit growth. The government depends on oil revenues, but attacks have slashed production to less than a third of pre-war levels.  The government expects to receive $820 million from oil this year. Out of that, $453 million will go to neighboring Sudan as payment for using its infrastructure for export; $183 million on the oil subsidy; and $166 million is allocated to the budget, which has a gaping deficit.   We were thinking that we would lift subsidies on the oil and will be able to cover this (deficit) and pay our salaries more easily,  said Thiik.  But we have some resistance from the parliament.  Lawmaker Nailo Mayo, the chair of the finance committee, said parliamentarians just wanted more information on who might be affected by ending the subsidies.   The committee ... is concerned about the social cost, I mean the suffering that could accrue to the poorer section of the community, and also we are afraid of the political cost, that is stability, arising from lack of transport,  he said.  State-subsidized oil sells at 22 South Sudanese pounds (SSP) per liter, but severe shortages mean many people buy it on the black market for 300 SSP per liter. The SSP trades at about 17.5 to the dollar on the black market and 17.68 at the central bank.  The process for allocating subsidized fuel, which is purchased with government-issued coupons, is unclear. South Sudan s conflict began in 2013 after President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, fired his deputy, Riek Machar, a Nuer. The conflict degenerated into ethnic fighting marked by widespread sexual violence.  Out of an original population of 12 million, 4 million have fled their homes. More than half of those who remain in South Sudan need food aid and nearly three-quarters of children are out of school. Thiik acknowledged social services were dire and said the finance ministry was trying to save money. It wants to reduce the number of embassies by a third, he said, because it is unable to fund them.   They (embassy staff) didn t get their salary for seven months and also they have arrears in their premises,  he said.  Asked about civil servants who had not been paid for four months, he said:  it is true that we have not secured money to pay salaries.    ",

        "text": "DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - A senior Tanzanian politician quit the ruling party on Monday complaining of human rights abuses and a weakening of democracy in the east African nation, in a move political analysts said could trigger a wave of defections to opposition parties. Since taking office in late 2015, President John Magufuli has introduced sweeping reforms, including as an anti-corruption drive that has won him some praise from Western donors. But his administration is also increasingly being accused by his opponents of undermining democracy by curbing dissent and stifling free speech, including banning newspapers. On Monday, Lazaro Nyalandu, who once served as a cabinet minister and has been a member of parliament for the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party for 17 years, said he was  deeply concerned  by human rights abuses and the direction of the economy.  It is evident that CCM has lost its way judging from the current political climate, leadership and economic trajectory in Tanzania,  Nyalandu said in a statement.  I have decided to resign from my position as a member of the CCM national executive committee and all other leadership positions in the party effective from today.  Nyalandu said he had also submitted his resignation as a member of parliament. The veteran politician was among more than a dozen candidates who sought the ruling party s presidential nomination in 2015 but was defeated by Magufuli. Bashiru Ally, a Dar es Salaam-based political analyst, said Magufuli s reforms could prompt further defections from the ruling party but said the opposition was poorly placed to benefit from such a trend.  Opposition parties are overly dependent on personalities who defect from CCM,  he told Reuters.  (But) they can only make temporary gains from such defections. They are not institutionalised and lack mass grassroots mobilization strategies.  CCM, which has been in power since Tanzania gained independence from Britain in 1961, has seen its support among young urban voters decline in previous elections, but opposition parties are too fragmented to oust it from power, analysts said.

Hastert pleaded guilty in October to a federal charge of \u201cstructuring\u201d - evading bank reporting rules by withdrawing large amounts of cash in smaller increments - in a hush-money case stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct. The 74-year-old, once one of the country\u2019s most powerful politicians, was hospitalized in November and was treated for a spinal infection requiring surgery, a severe blood infection and a stroke, his lawyers said in a motion filed on Friday. The lawyers have not been able to meet with Hastert to prepare for the scheduled Feb. 29 sentencing due to his health problems, the motion said. The lawyers requested a March 7 status hearing before U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin. Hastert faces up to five years in prison but prosecutors have recommended a sentence of six months or less, in exchange for his guilty plea. Hastert admitted to paying $1.7 million in cash to an individual he had known for decades to buy that person\u2019s silence and compensate for past misconduct toward that individual. Prosecutors did not spell out the misconduct, but unnamed law enforcement officials have told media that it was sexual and involved someone Hastert knew when he was a high school teacher and coach in his hometown of Yorkville, Illinois, in the 1960s and 1970s.

        "title": "Labor activists target Midwest politicians opposing wage increases",
        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. activists plan protests in up to 400 cities across the United States on Monday\u2019s Labor Day holiday to demand a minimum wage of $15 an hour, and are targeting politicians in Midwestern battleground states who have blocked such salary increases. The demonstrations, backed by the Service Employees International Union, will focus on hospital and home care workers, joining the fast-food and janitorial staffers who have protested since the \u201cFight for $15\u201d movement started in 2012. The movement has helped to spur politicians in a growing number of cities such as New York, Seattle, Minneapolis and Washington, D.C., to adopt measures that over time raise minimum wages to $15 an hour. Organizers are also increasing pressure on legislatures and governors, particularly in the Midwest, that have blocked or rolled back increases. The increased focus on politicians who oppose wage increases may capture some of the populist job-related voter discontent in traditionally Democratic Midwest states that helped U.S. President Donald Trump win the White House, said Dick Simpson, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. \u201cThe minimum wage issue is one (issue) they can immediately identify with because it affects their pocketbook with every paycheck,\u201d he said. Republican Governor Scott Walker of the presidential swing state of Wisconsin is among those targeted, as is Illinois Republican Governor Bruce Rauner, who last month vetoed raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2022, saying it would hurt employment and businesses. \u201cI\u2019m doing 40 hours of campaigning and knocking on doors and making phone calls, whatever it takes to get Walker out of office,\u201d Milwaukee hospital worker Margie Breelove said.  A voter-engagement drive, also slated to begin on Monday, seeks thousands of workers to pledge to volunteer 40 hours leading up to the 2018 elections.  The idea is to support candidates, most of them Democrats, for state legislatures or governor who favor wage hikes and union rights in such states as Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Illinois, along with other areas outside the Midwest. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about taking out people that have been rigging the rules against us, it\u2019s backing candidates who are prepared to support our agenda,\u201d SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said in a telephone interview. Representatives for the governors of Wisconsin, Missouri and Illinois did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.  Opponents of raising the current federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25 argue that it hurts businesses. The federal minimum wage was last increased in 2009. But supporters of an increase say the current level is not enough to live on and helps fuel the need for social safety-net programs. They point to studies showing little impact on jobs. Under a law approved last year, California set a $15 target for all workers, which it plans to reach in 2023. New York state is also gradually increasing its minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers. Cities, including Minneapolis, have also approved such legislation. However, since 2016, eight states, including Alabama, Kentucky and Iowa, have passed laws pre-empting local wage laws, according to the Economic Policy Institute. St. Louis\u2019 minimum wage, which had increased to $10 an hour, recently reverted to $7.70 after the legislature prohibited cities from creating separate wage laws. Missouri Governor Eric Greitens had opposed the increase. ",

        "title": "'Like any EU citizen': Belgium's Catalan asylum fix",
        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium has given a cool welcome to Catalonia s ousted leader and may not offer the safe haven from Spanish justice that it once extended as it grapples with separatist troubles of its own. Carles Puigdemont was not invited by the Belgian government, Prime Minister Charles Michel said in a curt statement, a day after he arrived unannounced following his dismissal by Madrid on charges of rebellion over Catalonia s independence bid.  He will be treated like any other European citizen,  Michel said, noting Puigdemont was entitled to move freely within the EU.  He has the same rights and duties ... no more, no less.  Deputy premier Kris Peeters was even brusquer, saying:  When you declare independence, it s better to stay with your people.  Puigdemont himself told a news conference in Brussels that he was there to engage with the European Union   which has shunned his pleas   and not to exploit Belgium s reputation as a place of political asylum for citizens of other EU states.  Nonetheless, he traveled to a small town in western Flanders on Monday to hire a human rights lawyer with a successful track record of fighting extradition to Spain on behalf of Basque separatist sympathizers. The lawyer, Paul Bekaert warned, however, that EU rules have made it harder. He told Reuters that the European Arrest Warrant system had removed exceptions previously made for extraditions to face  political  charges like sedition in other EU states. Politics, too, may play a part. Eighteen months before the next Belgian federal election, there have already been tensions over Catalonia within the coalition, where Flemish nationalists sympathetic to the Catalans are a major force and Michel, a French-speaking liberal, has lately tried to mollify Madrid. On Tuesday, Spain s High Court called Puigdemont and 13 members of his sacked administration to testify on Thursday. It also said it had started processing rebellion and sedition charges against Puigdemont and other Catalan leaders. Bekaert said Puigdemont, who faces up to 30 years in jail if Spanish prosecutors follow through on plans to charge him with sedition and misuse of public funds, saw no hurry to file for asylum, a simple procedure that would halt any extradition. However, asylum requests from EU citizens are rarely accepted nowadays and are often rejected within days.  As an EU citizen, Puigdemont has to demonstrate that there is a clear risk of prosecution against him, that the sentence he could face could be disproportionate, that he doesn t have a fair trial in Spain,  said Dirk Vanheule, a law professor at Antwerp University and president of Belgium s Refugee Council.  If he fails to demonstrate that from the beginning, the asylum proceeding can be terminated within five days.  Koen Lemmens, a human rights lawyer and professor at Leuven University, said the Belgian asylum agency would not take into account potential diplomatic embarrassment. But it would be up to Puigdemont to prove he would not get a fair trial. The Belgian government looks unwilling to back him up. Michel annoyed Spain by speaking out against police violence as people voted in the Oct. 1 independence referendum. But he also slapped down his Flemish nationalist immigration minister for suggesting at the weekend that Belgium might grant asylum. That did not stop the French-speaking Socialist opposition from accusing Michel of damaging Belgium s credibility abroad. The issue may not fade quickly. Any EU citizen can stay for up to three months without permission. And despite support for Madrid from the Belgian government, judges refused in 1996 and again, under new EU rules, in 2004 to extradite Luis Moreno and Raquel Garcia, whom it accused of aiding Basque militants. The N-VA has soft-pedaled demands for splitting the richer, Dutch-speaking half of Belgium off but with elections looming it must be wary of the small, anti-immigration Vlaams Belang, whose leader attended Puigdemont s Brussels news conference. VB leader Tom Van Grieken called on N-VA ministers to break with Michel s refusal to recognize Catalan independence. Mark Demesmaeker, an N-VA member of the European Parliament, told Reuters he met Puigdemont in Barcelona a month ago and said he did have a case for asylum as the EU  looks the other way .  The fact he is coming here already says plenty enough about the situation in Spain and Catalonia,  Demesmaeker told Reuters.  He has no faith in the Spanish judiciary.  ",

        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The driver of a tour bus that crashed on Tuesday on a quiet road in Mexico s Yucatan Peninsula, killing 12 people, may have lost control after one of the front tires exploded, the local police chief said. The bus was carrying 31 passengers, including citizens of the United States, Brazil, Canada and Sweden, on a trip to Mayan ruins when it crashed and flipped over, authorities said. Most of those aboard were travelers on Royal Caribbean cruise ships.  It seems a front tire of the bus exploded, making it lose control and leave the asphalt,  Carlos Briceno Villagomez, head of the police in the municipality of Bacalar, told Mexican TV network Televisa on Tuesday night. The government of Quintana Roo state said it was investigating the cause of the accident, which happened on a flat stretch of road and did not appear to involve another vehicle. The driver was injured and has been arrested. A Mexican tour guide was among those killed.  A local civil protection official said authorities were also investigating whether human error contributed to the accident.   The U.S. State Department confirmed on Wednesday that multiple American citizens had died in the crash. Mexican authorities said eight U.S. citizens died.   We can confirm the deaths of multiple U.S. citizens in #Mexico bus accident, and several injuries. We express our heartfelt condolences to those affected by this tragedy,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a post on Twitter. One Canadian died in the crash and three others were injured, a spokesman for Canada s Global Affairs department said. Two Swedish citizens died and two others were injured, Mexican authorities said. A child was among the dead. Quintana Roo is one of three states on Mexico s Yucatan Peninsula, a major tourist destination. ",

        "title": "Indian navy the odd man out in Asia's 'Quad' alliance",
        "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Trump administration is pushing security ties between the United States, India, Japan and Australia, but the revival of the Asian  Quad  must overcome lingering mistrust in New Delhi towards its allies that hampers genuine military cooperation. Joint naval drills have been at the heart of a relationship that analysts widely see as a move to counterbalance China s rising power by binding the region s leading democracies more closely together. But while the navies of the United States, Japan and Australia can easily operate together - based on common U.S.-designed combat systems and data links - India is the outlier.  Not only are most of its ships and warplanes Russian-made, its government and military remain deeply reluctant to share data and open up sensitive military communications systems. The United States has carried out more naval exercises with India than any other nation. But naval sources and experts say these are more about  cultural familiarization  than drills for joint combat. Because India will not sign an agreement on sharing data, naval exercises are conducted through voice and text commands with rudimentary SMS-style data exchange, Indian and Japanese military sources said.  Think of it as directing your friend to your house in the 1980s. Your left may be his right, neither of you have situational awareness,  said Abhijit Iyer-Mitra, a senior fellow at New Delhi s Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies who has tracked the military exercises.  What the Americans want is 2017 - drop a pin on Google maps and hit share. You know where your friend is and he knows where your house is and how to get to it.  The Indian defense ministry did not respond to a request for a comment. The so-called Quad to discuss and cooperate on security emerged briefly as an initiative a decade ago - much to the annoyance of China - and was revived recently, with an officials-level meeting this month on the sidelines of a regional gathering in Manila. The Trump administration has talked up cooperation with India as part of efforts for a  free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific . Describing the Indian and Pacific Oceans as a  single strategic arena , U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson described India and the United States as regional  bookends .  In concrete terms, it will lead to great co-ordination between the Indian, Japanese and American militaries including maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, amphibious warfare, and humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and search and rescue,  he said.  To be sure, India and the United States have steadily been bringing more powerful ships into their annual  Malabar  drills that have been expanded to include Japan in recent years.  This year the USS Nimitz carrier group was deployed for the maneuvers off India s eastern coast, along with an aircraft carrier from India and a helicopter carrier from Japan. But a Japanese Maritime Self Defence Forces official said when Japan conducts drills with the Indian navy, communication is done mostly through voice transmission. There is no satellite link that would allow the two navies to access information and share monitor displays in on-board command centers. Communication is usually the most difficult aspect of any joint drill, he said. The exercises are meant to lay the ground for joint patrols that the U.S. eventually wants to conduct with India and its allies across the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.  U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, said better interoperability was a goal of the exercises and noted that India s enhanced role as a major U.S. defense partner would help boost the relationship.   The designation of India as a major defense partner is significant and is intended to elevate defense trade and technology sharing with India to a level commensurate with that of our closest allies and partners,  he said.  As this relationship matures so will the level of interoperability.  Last year, India signed a military logistics pact with the United States after a decade of wrangling, but two other agreements are stuck.  The United States says the Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) would allow it to supply India with encrypted communications equipment and systems. The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement is the other pact that would set a framework through which the United States could share sensitive data to aid targeting and navigation with India. India is concerned that agreeing to the CISMOA would open up its military communications to the United States, and even allow it to listen in on operations where Indian and U.S. interests may not coincide - such as against arch-rival Pakistan, military officials in New Delhi say. Captain Gurpreet Khurana, executive director at the government-funded National Maritime Foundation, said India s underlying concern was having its autonomy constrained by binding its military into U.S. codes and operating procedures. Once, the Americans proposed a portable  suitcase  communications system called the CENTRIXS which could transmit full situational awareness data to Indian ships while the two navies practised together. India refused to allow it to be plugged in for the duration of the exercise, citing operational security, according to an Indian source briefed on the planning of the exercises.  Even the joint air exercises that the two countries are conducting as a follow-on to Malabar are severely restricted, the source said. India sends its Russian-acquired Sukhoi jets to the drills, but their radars and jammers are turned off.  David Shear, who served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asia under President Barack Obama, said U.S. forces, particularly the Navy, were well aware of the interoperability constraints to interacting with India.  They understand what the obstacles are and that this is going to be a long-term project,  he said.  ",

        "title": "Despite undiplomatic discourse, Trump's dance card is full",
        "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A subtle diplomat like Talleyrand, Donald Trump is not. The U.S. president, in his first foray at the U.N. General Assembly, derided North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a  rocket man ... on a suicide mission  and delivered an unabashed defense of sovereignty at the seat of global multilateralism. But if his speech drew barbs from allies and authoritarian adversaries, it did nothing to deter his dance partners at the premier diplomatic waltz of the year, the 193-member United Nations  annual gathering of world leaders known by the acronym UNGA. Trump held bilateral meetings with 13 leaders this week,   more than his predecessor Barack Obama had at his first UNGA(five), his last (six) or his busiest (10), according to data compiled by CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller. Trump s less than diplomatic speech on Tuesday recalled the fiery nationalist language of his Jan. 20 inaugural address and raised eyebrows across the political spectrum by its bald assertion of the primacy of U.S. interests.  Our government s first duty is to its people, to our citizens - to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values,  he said, evoking his campaign s nationalist themes despite the departure of advocates such as Steve Bannon from the White House.  Germany s foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, delivered a riposte in a scathing and barely veiled critique on Thursday.  National egoism, I believe, is worthless as a regulatory principle for our world,  Gabriel said.  The motto  our country first  not only leads to more national confrontations and less prosperity, in the end there can only be losers.  Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe s authoritarian 93-year-old leader who has ruled the former British colony since independence in 1980, also sought to nudge Trump in a more peaceable direction.  Mr. Trump, please blow your trumpet, blow your trumpet in a musical way towards the values of unity, peace, cooperation, togetherness, dialogue,  he said. In his speech, Trump said if the United States were forced to defend itself or its allies, it would have  no choice but to totally destroy North Korea  and he called Iran s government a  murderous regime  that exports  violence, bloodshed and chaos.  His directness contrasts with the subtlety of 18th- and 19th-century French diplomat Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand, who is reputed to have said:  A diplomat who says  yes  means  maybe,  a diplomat who says  maybe  means  no,  and a diplomat who says  no  is no diplomat.  Still, Trump s language has seeped into the discourse of other leaders, perhaps seeking to curry his favor. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas spoke of  draining the swamp  of Israeli occupation while South Korean President Moon Jae-in called North Korean behavior  extremely deplorable.  Trump, possibly recalling the criticism that his Democratic U.S. presidential opponent Hillary Clinton earned for calling some of his supporters a  basket of deplorables,  was pleased.  I m very happy that you used the word  deplorable ,  Trump told Moon.  That s been a very lucky word for me and many millions of people.  Both Moon and Abbas had sitdowns with Trump, and there was no shortage of others who wanted to meet him. A U.S. official said the White House accommodated as many requests for meetings as they could schedule, noting some leaders who wanted to meet Trump did not make the cut. The U.S. president has also wanted to see the leaders of China, India and Germany, but they did not come this year. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani met Trump on Thursday, and officials in Kabul said all the impetus had come from the Afghan side, with no burning interest from the White House. French President Emmanuel Macron made clear he would work with any U.S. president, whoever he was, and said he and Trump had clear disagreements on climate change and Iran policy.  I want a deep, cordial dialogue to bring him back into the international and multilateral fold on these two subjects,  Macron told reporters.  As I m a pragmatist, I put myself in a position to work the best way possible with him.   Asked if dealing with Trump was like managing a difficult child, the French president replied:  Not at all. I m managing a partner of the world s biggest power and a historical partner for our country.  ",

        "title": "Second federal judge blocks Trump's curbs on travel to U.S.",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A second U.S. federal judge has blocked parts of President Donald Trump\u2019s latest travel ban on people entering the United States from eight countries, dealing another legal blow to the administration\u2019s third bid to impose travel restrictions. U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland, in a ruling issued overnight, said the policy as applied to six majority-Muslim countries likely violates the U.S. Constitution\u2019s prohibition on religious discrimination. He also ruled the ban ran afoul of immigration law. Trump\u2019s ban would have taken effect on Wednesday but was blocked on Tuesday by a U.S. federal judge in Hawaii in a separate challenge.  Together, the pair of rulings set up a high-stakes battle over the president\u2019s executive authority that is expected to ultimately wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump\u2019s latest order targeted people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea, as well as certain government officials from Venezuela. Neither of the court rulings lifts the restrictions on North Korea and Venezuela. In the Maryland ruling, Chuang questioned the government\u2019s argument that the restrictions are needed until the affected countries provide more information on travelers to the United States.  He cited various statements made by Trump, including his 2015 call for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the United States.\u201d Chuang wrote that the president\u2019s public statements \u201cnot only fail to advance, but instead undermine, the position that the primary purpose of the travel ban now derives from the need to address information sharing deficiencies.\u201d  The latest ban, announced last month, was the third version of a policy that targeted Muslim-majority countries but had been restricted by the courts. The Maryland case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents several advocacy groups, including the International Refugee Assistance Project. \u201cLike the two versions before it, President Trump\u2019s latest travel ban is still a Muslim ban at its core. And like the two before it, this one is going down to defeat in the courts,\u201d said ACLU lawyer Omar Jadwat. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu said Hawaii was likely to succeed in proving that the policy  violated federal immigration law. The White House called the ruling flawed and said it would appeal. Unlike the Hawaii ruling, the Maryland decision would lift the restrictions only for people with family connections to the United States. White House representatives had no immediate comment. ",

        "title": "Senator talks all night as Democrats fight Trump court nominee",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic senator delivered a 15-1/2-hour, all-night speech denouncing President Donald Trump\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court nominee on Wednesday, joining an effort to block Senate confirmation of Neil Gorsuch in a heated political showdown with Republicans. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon began his speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday evening and wrapped up mid-morning on Wednesday. The Senate was expected to vote on Thursday at 11 a.m. to try to end a Democratic procedural effort called a filibuster aimed at blocking Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation to a lifetime post on the court. Republicans were expected to fall short of being able to halt the filibuster, but said they had the votes needed to then immediately change the Senate rules to prohibit filibusters against Supreme Court nominees. Republicans said Gorsuch would  be confirmed on Friday one way or the other. Senate confirmation of Gorsuch, 49, would reinstate the court\u2019s conservative majority, allow Trump to leave an indelible mark on America\u2019s highest judicial body and fulfill a top campaign promise by the Republican president. Toward the end of his marathon speech, Merkley looked weary, his suit jacket unbuttoned and his yellow tie billowing out. He stood beside an easel holding graphics that an aide would periodically adjust. \u201cFor the first time in U.S. history, a seat has been stolen from one president and delivered to another in a court-packing scheme. If that were to succeed, it would set a precedent that will haunt the court for decades to come,\u201d Merkley said. He noted that the Republicans who control the Senate refused last year to consider former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016, the same seat Gorsuch now has been named to fill. Later on the Senate floor, Republican Senator Cory Gardner countered that such an argument amounted to advocating that \u201ctwo wrongs must make a right.\u201d Merkley criticized Gorsuch\u2019s legal opinions and said Gorsuch would become a conservative legal activist on the court. At one point, Merkley read a 1998 speech by one of the past giants of the Senate, Democrat Robert Byrd, decrying partisanship in Congress.  \u201cI believe that the American people are more than tired of partisan warfare. I believe they wish for less of it from Congress, especially in the Senate, where more statesmanship and a longer view are expected,\u201d Merkley said, quoting Byrd. The Senate has a lengthy history of long speeches, including notable ones in recent years by Senators Ted Cruz, Chris Murphy and Rand Paul. The Senate Historical Office listed Merkley\u2019s speech at 15 hours and 26 minutes, the eighth longest in Senate history. The longest came in 1957 when segregationist Senator Strom Thurmond spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes against legislation, later enacted, protecting black voting rights. On the second day of formal Senate debate on Gorsuch\u2019s  nomination, various Republicans called the conservative Colorado-based federal appeals court judge \u201cincredibly qualified,\u201d an \u201cintellectual heavyweight\u201d and \u201calways true to the law.\u201d \u201cDemocrats are bowing to hard-left special interests that can\u2019t get over the results of the election and thus are demanding complete Democratic opposition to everything this president touches,\u201d Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. Democrats accuse Gorsuch of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans in legal opinions, and displaying insufficient independence from Trump. Republicans control the Senate 52-48. The rule change, which requires a simple majority, has been dubbed the \u201cnuclear option,\u201d and Trump has urged McConnell to \u201cgo nuclear.\u201d A filibuster requires a super-majority of 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate in order to proceed to a simple majority vote on a Supreme Court nominee or legislation. The 60-vote super-majority threshold empowers the minority party to hold up the majority party and has forced the Senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship on legislation and presidential appointments. Republican Senator John McCain, known as a defender of Senate traditions, offered reluctant support for the rule change, but said it likely would lead to judicial nominees \u201cfrom the extremes of both left and right.\u201d \u201cWhat we are about to do at the end of this week will have tremendous consequences, and I fear that some day we will regret what we\u2019re about to do. In fact, I\u2019m confident we will,\u201d McCain said on the Senate floor. The White House denied on Wednesday that Gorsuch had engaged in plagiarism after media reports accused him of copying some language and failing to cite relevant sources in his 2006 book about assisted suicide and euthanasia. \u201cThere is only one explanation for this baseless, last-second smear of Judge Gorsuch: those desperate to justify the unprecedented filibuster of a well-qualified and mainstream nominee to the Supreme Court,\u201d White House spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement.

        "text": "TORONTO (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp is formally requesting arbitration over U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, seeking $15 billion in damages, the company said in legal papers dated Friday.  TransCanada submitted a notice for an arbitration claim in January and had then tried to negotiate with the U.S. government to \u201creach an amicable settlement,\u201d the company said in files posted on the pipeline\u2019s website. \u201cUnfortunately, the parties were unable to settle the dispute.\u201d TransCanada said it then filed its formal arbitration request under North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) provisions, seeking to recover what it says are costs and damages. The Keystone XL was designed to link existing pipeline networks in Canada and the United States to bring crude from Alberta and North Dakota to refineries in Illinois and, eventually, the Gulf of Mexico coast.      Obama rejected the cross-border crude oil pipeline last November, seven years after it was first proposed, saying it would not make a meaningful long-term contribution to the U.S. economy. TransCanada is suing the United States in federal court in a separate legal action, seeking to reverse the pipeline\u2019s rejection. NAFTA, whose arbitration provisions allow companies to challenge governments before international panels, has been a target of recent anti-free-trade sentiments in the United States. The heads of NAFTA members, Canada, the United States and Mexico, are expected to meet in Ottawa for a North American leaders\u2019 Summit on June 29. Canada was supposed to host the meeting early last year but canceled it amid tension between then Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Obama over the Keystone XL pipeline. TransCanada and the U.S. Department of Energy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  ",

        "title": "Rolling back Taliban grip on Afghan territory key aim of Trump plan: official",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rolling back territorial gains by the Taliban and strengthening the Afghanistan army\u2019s ability to fight will be two key objectives of President Donald Trump\u2019s new strategy for the country, a senior administration official said on Tuesday. Trump, in a televised speech on Monday, promised a stepped-up military campaign against Taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the U.S.-backed Afghan government. In outlining his strategy to give the U.S. military more authority to make battlefield decisions, Trump did not provide a timetable for determining whether the mission is a success or how commanders would be able to judge progress. The senior administration official said, however, that one general measure of progress was assessing how much and what territory is controlled by the Afghan government or by the Taliban and other extremist groups such as Islamic State\u2019s Afghan affiliate. \u201cIt\u2019s also the estimated number of fighters, the presence of al Qaeda and ISIS, how strong are they, how many fighters do they have, how are their training camps, what are their finance networks like,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Also key will be the effectiveness of the Afghan army and whether U.S.-led armed forces can help it seize control of some territory held by the Taliban, the official added.  Trump, who was reluctant to approve a deeper engagement in Afghanistan after 16 years of war, wanted to keep a close eye on whether progress is being made, the official said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be taking the temperature continuously,\u201d the official said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we expect to see any real gains materialize for at least six months. But from that point on, it\u2019s going to be something that we essentially never stop evaluating.\u201d U.S.-backed Afghan forces overthrew the Taliban\u2019s hard-line Islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, architect of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington that year.  U.S. forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three American presidents. About 2,400 U.S. troops have died there in America\u2019s longest military conflict.    Three U.S. officials said on Tuesday the administration had yet to settle on specific metrics to measure progress in Afghanistan and assess the contributions of the Afghan government, Pakistan, India and America\u2019s NATO allies. One of the officials said there was no point \u201cin setting specific targets, much less making them public, because that would risk making our partners think that once they had met those marks, they didn\u2019t have to do more.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019re after is a progressive process,\u201d the official said, \u201cso for example the Afghan security forces keep improving their capabilities until they don\u2019t need us anymore, the government in Kabul keeps improving its record on eliminating corruption and improving local, regional and national governance.\u201d But Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, struck a critical tone on Tuesday. \u201cWhile a \u2018conditions based\u2019 approach is appealing to military leaders because it gives the Taliban less certainty about how long it will take to wait us out, it also diminishes pressure on the Afghan government to reform itself and give the Afghan people something worth fighting for, since it indicates a willingness to bail them out indefinitely,\u201d Schiff said in a statement.

        "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian government forces will advance soon to take Raqqa city, which U.S.-backed fighters seized from Islamic State last month, a senior Iranian official said on Friday.  Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iran s Supreme Leader, also accused the United States of seeking to divide Syria by stationing its forces east of the Euphrates river.   We will witness in the near future the advance of government and popular forces in Syria and east of the Euphrates, and the liberation of Raqqa city,  he said in televised comments on a visit to Beirut.  Since early in the Syrian war, Iran has provided critical military support to the Damascus government, helping it regain swathes of land from rebels and militants. Last month, U.S.-backed militias declared victory in Raqqa, Islamic State s former headquarters in Syria, after months of fighting with the help of the U.S.-led coalition.  The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, is also battling Islamic State in eastern Syria with U.S.-led air strikes and special forces. The SDF assault in Deir al-Zor has focused on territory east of the river, which bisects the oil-rich province.     The Syrian army, with Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, is waging its own separate offensive against Islamic State there, mostly to the west of the river. The U.S.-led coalition and the Russian military have been holding  deconfliction  meetings - to prevent clashes between planes and troops - though the two offensives have sometimes come into conflict. The U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State has repeatedly said it does not seek to fight Syrian President Bashar al-Assad s military.  After capturing Raqqa, the SDF said the people of the majority Arab city would decide their own future  within the framework of a decentralized, federal, democratic Syria.   The Kurdish-led SDF pledged  to protect the frontiers of (Raqqa) province against all external threats  and to hand control to a civil council from the city. But last week, Damascus said it deemed Raqqa  occupied  until the Syrian army took control. With Islamic State near defeat in Syria, rivalry between Damascus and Kurdish-led forces is emerging as a fault line that could draw the United States in more deeply and complicate Russian diplomacy. Syria s main Kurdish groups hope for a new phase of negotiations to shore up their autonomous regions in the north. The Syrian government, however, has asserted in more forceful terms its claim to territory under SDF control including oil fields in the east.  ",

        "title": "Euro zone enlargement call sparks backlash in Germany",
        "text": "TALLINN (Reuters) - After years of bailing out Greece, the idea of letting more poorer states into the euro zone has sparked controversy, particularly in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking re-election in two weeks time.  The backlash came after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called on Wednesday for non-euro zone countries to quickly adopt the single currency so that the European Union can find new unity in the euro after Britain leaves in 2019. Juncker promised to propose technical and financial help for the willing, quickly triggering concern from influential German members of the European Parliament, like the deputy chairman of the economic committee Markus Ferber. Juncker s call was interpreted by some in Germany as meaning the Commission would be lenient in assessing the readiness for the single currency of the mostly former communist and poorer eastern European countries like Bulgaria or Romania. Greece, which adopted the euro in 2001, later turned out not to have been ready because of falsified deficit statistics. The country triggered a massive debt crisis in the euro zone and had to be bailed out three times by other euro zone governments.  Euro for all EU countries? There are clear criteria and rules for joining. Greece can not repeat itself,  Ferber tweeted after the Juncker speech. EU officials became concerned that the misreading of the Juncker speech in Germany could fuel support for populist and eurosceptic parties and Juncker aides took to Twitter on Friday to try and counter that effect. They stressed that countries would only be allowed into the single currency if they met economic and governance criteria. In German language-only tweets they also pointed out that some, like keen would-be member Bulgaria, already meet many, though not all, of the economic standards for entry. To adopt the euro, a European Union country has to have low inflation, interest rates and debt, a deficit within the EU limits, as well as a stable exchange rate, proven by two years spent in the Exchange Rate Mechanism II without severe tensions.  The exchange rate of the Bulgarian Lev is absolutely stable to the euro since 2006,  Juncker s head of cabinet Martin Selmayr tweeted.  The Inflation rate of Bulgaria is just at 0.2 pct and much lower than in the euro area.  Addressing German sensitivity to debt, he tweeted:  German debt is almost 66 pct of GDP, more than twice as high as the Bulgarian one.  Romania and Bulgaria meet all the nominal criteria to join the euro except the two-year exchange rate stability test in the ERM II and the compatibility of their central bank laws with euro zone requirements.  They are also far from meeting the  soft  criterion of real economic convergence with euro zone economies   a factor that could prevent them getting the go-ahead for adopting the euro. Countries outside the euro zone include Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Denmark and Britain, but the last two have a formal opt-out from joining. Others have a legal obligation to adopt the euro when they meet all the criteria, but there are no deadlines for that. Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said Bulgaria had expressed to him a clear desire to join the euro zone. Romania has expressed a similar sentiment.  But some of the biggest and more wealthy non-euro members of the EU like Sweden, Poland or the Czech Republic and Hungary have no plans to adopt the currency in the foreseeable future, preferring to keep the economic flexibility provided by control over their own exchange rate.

        "title": "Religious liberty bill passes Georgia state legislature",
        "text": " (In March 16 item, corrects timing of legislative session in final paragraph) By Rich McKay ATLANTA (Reuters) - A religious freedom bill described by opponents as being discriminatory against same-sex couples passed the Georgia state legislature on Wednesday night in an 11th-hour vote ahead of the session\u2019s close.  The legislation, dubbed the Religious Liberty Bill, still has to be signed by Georgia\u2019s Republican Governor Nathan Deal to become law. Deal has made clear that he will not sign a bill that allows discrimination, but his office did not immediately respond to request for comment on Wednesday night. Similar bills in states like Indiana and Arkansas sparked storms of criticism last year, forcing many lawmakers to retreat from the provisions. The Georgia bill, reworked several times by lawmakers amid criticism that earlier versions went too far, declares that no pastor can be forced to perform a same-sex wedding.  The bill also grants faith-based organizations \u2013 churches, religious schools or associations - the right to reject holding events for people or groups of whom they object. Faith-based groups also could not be forced to hire or retain an employee whose beliefs run counter to the organization\u2019s. Opponents say the bill could be used to deny services and discriminate against same-sex couples. \u201cThe decision by the legislature today was to make an egregious and discriminatory bill even worse,\u201d the Human Rights Campaign, which represents the\u00a0lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, said in a statement.  \u201cIt\u2019s appalling that anti-equality extremists in the legislature are trying to ignore the will of the people of Georgia,\u201d it said. Mike Griffin, a lobbyist and spokesman for the Georgia Baptist Convention, applauded the bill\u2019s passage. He said that while the bill did not give them everything they wanted, he added: \u201cWe feel we\u2019ve advanced our protection of our First Amendment Right to religious freedom.\u201d \u201cOur rights of religious liberty don\u2019t end inside the four walls of a church,\u201d he said. In a late added amendment, the proposed law says that it cannot allow discrimination already prohibited by federal law, which opponents said could nullify some of its provisions. More than 300 large corporations and small businesses, including Delta Airlines and Coca Cola, have signed a pledge decrying the Georgia legislation and urging the state lawmakers to drop it. The state legislature is set to wrap up its current legislative session next week. ",

        "title": "U.S.-Russia tensions over Syria will not 'spiral out of control': Mattis",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tensions between the United States and Russia will not \u201cspiral out of control\u201d following last week\u2019s U.S. cruise missile strikes on a Syrian air base, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday, describing it as a one-off response to Syria\u2019s use of banned chemical weapons. President Donald Trump, in his biggest foreign policy decision since taking office in January, ordered the strikes after concluding that Syria waged a nerve gas attack in rebel-held territory that killed 87 people, many of them children.  Russia, which has advisers on the ground aiding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, warned the U.S. strike could have serious consequences. Syria denies involvement. \u201cIt will not spiral out of control,\u201d Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon. \u201cI\u2019m confident the Russians will act in their own best interest and there is nothing in their best interest to say they want this situation to go out of control.\u201d Mattis has repeatedly warned that the U.S. military remained ready to act again should Assad use chemical weapons, saying on Tuesday that Assad would \u201cpay a very, very stiff price.\u201d    At the same time, he acknowledged that Trump had only authorized the single attack, meaning the U.S. military would not automatically have the authority to strike again should Washington determine another case of chemical weapons use. Mattis also sought to downplay concerns about Pentagon mission creep, saying the U.S. military\u2019s focus in Syria was still fighting Islamic State militants, not becoming entangled in Syria\u2019s messy civil war between Assad and his opponents. \u201cThe rest of the campaign stays on track exactly as it was before Assad\u2019s violation,\u201d Mattis said. The incident has chilled U.S. relations with Moscow after a presidential campaign during which Trump frequently called for an alliance with Russia to fight Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq. It has also led the Trump administration to harden its attitude against Assad weeks after top U.S. officials said they were more concerned with defeating Islamic State militants than getting Assad out of power. \u201cI don\u2019t see a peaceful, stable Syria in the future that has Assad in charge,\u201d White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t see a future Syria that has (Assad) as the leader of that government.\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson denounced Russian support for Assad as he prepared to fly to Moscow on Tuesday. \u201cIt is clear to us the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,\u201d Tillerson told reporters in Italy. U.S. intelligence indicates that Syrian Su-22 aircraft taking off from Shayrat airfield delivered the nerve agent sarin, according to a White House report given to reporters. Mattis said there was no doubt that Damascus was responsible. Although some U.S. officials have strongly hinted they suspect Russia, which has a presence at Shayrat, may have known something about the planned attack, none have conclusively linked Moscow to the incident itself. Mattis suggested the United States did not have firm evidence that Russia had foreknowledge or was complicit in the chemical attack. \u201cIt was very clear that the Assad regime planned it, orchestrated it and executed it and beyond that we can\u2019t say right now. We know what I just told you, we don\u2019t know anything beyond that,\u201d Mattis said, when asked whether Russia had a role. ",

        "title": "Trump wins decisively in South Carolina, Clinton clinches Nevada",
        "text": "LAS VEGAS/COLUMBIA, S.C. (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump rolled to victory on Saturday in South Carolina in a contest that saw former Florida Governor Jeb Bush drop out, while Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton beat back a strong challenge from Bernie Sanders in Nevada. The victories by Trump, who is running as an anti-establishment outsider, and Clinton, a preeminent political insider, solidified their positions as the front-runners to win their parties\u2019 respective nominations ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. The night\u2019s most prominent casualty, Bush suffered a distant fourth place finish in the Republican contest and announced he had suspended his campaign, ending his dream of becoming a third Bush president after his father and brother. \u201cThe people of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have spoken, and I really respect their decision,\u201d an emotional Bush said in Columbia. He finished far out of the running in each of the first three states. By winning both South Carolina and New Hampshire and holding leads in 13 states that hold Republican contests on March 1, Trump was arguably on track to win the nomination, an outcome that seemed astounding to contemplate when he entered the race last summer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult for him to be derailed at this point,\u201d said Hogan Gidley, who was a senior adviser to former Republican candidate Mike Huckabee.    The 69-year-old real estate billionaire and reality TV star was declared the winner in South Carolina about an hour after polls closed, and launched into a feisty victory speech.  \u201cLet\u2019s put this thing away,\u201d Trump told cheering supporters in Spartanburg. He denounced TV pundits for saying there could be enough anti-Trump votes to beat him when the race thins further. \u201cThese geniuses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand that as people drop out, I\u2019m going to get a lot of those votes also. You don\u2019t just add them together.\u201d Trump easily defeated Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who were in a close fight for second place and the right to declare themselves the anti-Trump alternative. With 99 percent of South Carolina precincts reporting, Trump had 32.5 percent, followed by Rubio with 22.5 percent and Cruz with 22.3 percent.  Cruz\u2019s inability to distinguish himself from Rubio in the state was a blow to his campaign, which had invested heavily there to rally support among South Carolina\u2019s large population of evangelical voters. Trump\u2019s victory won him at least 44 of the state\u2019s 50 delegates, bringing his delegate count to 61, compared to 11 for Cruz and 10 for Rubio, according to a tally by Real Clear Politics. Republicans need 1,237 delegates to win the party nomination. It was Trump\u2019s second victory in a row, an outcome that frightens establishment Republicans but thrills the \u201cthrow-the-bums-out\u201d conservative base of the party that has long been fed up with Washington.         The bellicose New York billionaire had created some last-minute drama in South Carolina after Pope Francis said on Thursday his views on U.S. immigration were \u201cnot Christian.\u201d Trump, who has also advocated a ban on Muslim immigrants to counter domestic terror threats, stirred fresh controversy on Friday when he told a crowd about a U.S. general who was said to have dipped bullets in pigs\u2019 blood to kill Muslim prisoners a century ago. Former Secretary of State Clinton\u2019s victory in the Nevada Democratic caucuses, meanwhile, could help calm worries among the Democratic establishment about the strength of her campaign. Her result denied Sanders the breakthrough win he had sought in a state with a heavy minority population, but his ability to close a one-time double-digit polling lead for Clinton suggests the Democratic nominating race will be long and hard fought. With 90 percent of precincts reporting, the former first lady was leading with 52.6 percent of the vote to Sanders\u2019 47.4 percent.  Clinton\u2019s victory gave her fresh momentum as she heads into the next contest in South Carolina on Feb. 27, where polls show her with a double-digit lead largely as a result of heavy support from black voters. \u201cSome may have doubted us, but we never doubted each other,\u201d she told cheering supporters at a victory rally in Las Vegas. \u201cThis is your campaign.\u201d     Sanders vowed to fight on and set his sights on the 11 states that vote on \u201cSuper Tuesday,\u201d March 1. He predicted that when Democrats gather for their nominating convention in Philadelphia in July, \u201cWe are going to see the results of one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States.\u201d \u201cThe wind is at our backs,\u201d the Vermont senator said. \u201cWe have the momentum.\u201d After routing Clinton in New Hampshire and finishing a strong second in Iowa, states with nearly all-white populations, Sanders had hoped to prove in Nevada that he could win over black and Hispanic voters and compete nationally as the race moves to states with more diverse populations. But entrance polling in Nevada showed he badly lost among black voters, by 76 percent to 22 percent, a bad omen for South Carolina and other southern states with big black populations. He did win among Hispanics by 53 percent to 45 percent. Clinton\u2019s campaign has argued she would assert control of the Democratic race once it moved to more diverse states with black and Hispanic populations who have traditionally backed Clinton and have been slow to warm to Sanders.

        "title": "In hats and t-shirts, Trump fans rally in Jerusalem's Old City",
        "text": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - On a rooftop overlooking the walls of Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, around 200 American-Israeli fans of Donald Trump gathered to proclaim their support for the Republican candidate, convinced he will be Israel\u2019s best friend if elected. Wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball caps, the small crowd, ranging from Holocaust survivors in their 80s to grinning teenagers in Trump t-shirts, said they didn\u2019t care about the sexual assault allegations against the candidate or the online anti-Semitism of some of his supporters. \u201cTrump will let Israel be itself and make its own decisions, that\u2019s what I like,\u201d David Weissman, a 35-year-old from Queens, New York, who moved to Israel three years ago, said at the event late on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s not a saint, but look at his achievements. He\u2019s not afraid to identify the enemy as radical Islam, and he\u2019s not going to support the two-state solution,\u201d he said, referring to long-standing efforts to forge peace with the Palestinians. Trump has said that the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct fabricated their stories to damage his campaign. Others at the rally said they liked the fact that Trump was promising to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, officially recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, and would not berate Israel for building Jewish settlements in occupied territory. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that he becomes president,\u201d said Connie Gordner, 82, who moved to Israel from Jacksonville, Florida, 21 years ago. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton becomes president, we\u2019re dead.\u201d The rally was organized by Republicans Overseas Israel, which estimates that there are 300,000 U.S. citizens living in Israel or in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians seek for their own state. Even if only a third of those cast absentee ballots, organizers believe it could have an impact in some swing states, come Nov. 8. Marc Zell, co-chairman of the non-profit group, believes around three-quarters of American-Israelis support the Republican party and its candidate. In an impassioned speech to the small crowd, David Friedman, Trump\u2019s adviser on Israel, heaped criticism on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for her decisions as secretary of state and said Trump was Israel\u2019s greatest hope. \u201cUnder Trump, the United States will never pressure Israel into accepting a two-state solution or any other solution that is against the wishes of the Israeli people,\u201d he said, to whoops, cheers and a few shouts of \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d. While the motley crowd was unabashed in its Trumpian fervor, polls indicate that most Jewish Israelis favor Clinton over Trump, by 40 percent to 31 percent. The critical element is American-Israelis who retain the right to vote in U.S. elections. Some estimates suggest more than a quarter of them live in settlements, which tend to have a more conservative, national-religious outlook. Trump\u2019s messages have been designed to appeal to their sentiments. On Wednesday, he delivered a minute-long video to the rally, playing up his connections to Judaism through his daughter\u2019s marriage, saying it enhanced his respect for the faith. \u201cMy administration will stand side-by-side with the Jewish people and Israel\u2019s leaders to continue strengthening the bridges that connect not only Jewish Americans and Israelis but also all Americans and Israelis,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether we will make America and Israel safe again.\u201d ",

        "title": "House backs massive increase in defense spending",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed its version of a massive annual defense bill on Friday, leaving out controversial amendments on transgender troops and climate policy but backing President Donald Trump\u2019s desire for a bigger, stronger military. The vote was 344-81 to pass the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which sets military policy and authorizes up to $696 billion in spending for the Department of Defense. Underscoring bipartisan support for higher defense spending in Congress, 117 Democrats joined 227 Republicans in backing the measure. Only eight Republicans and 73 Democrats voted no. But the measure faces more hurdles before it can become law, notably because it would increase military spending beyond last year\u2019s $619 billion bill, defying \u201csequestration\u201d caps on government spending set in the 2011 Budget Control Act. Trump wants to pay for a military spending increase by slashing nondefense spending. His fellow Republicans control majorities in both the House and Senate, but they will need support from Senate Democrats, who want to increase military spending, for Trump\u2019s plans to go into effect. The House NDAA also increases spending on missile defense by 25 percent, adds thousands more active-duty troops to the Army, provides five new ships for the Navy and provides a 2.4 percent salary increase for U.S. troops, their largest pay raise in eight years. And it creates a new Space Corps military service, pushed by lawmakers worried about China and Russia\u2019s activities in space, but opposed by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. The Senate will vote on its version of the NDAA later this year, and the two versions must be reconciled before the measure can be sent to the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto. Trump has not threatened to veto the bill, but his administration listed several problems with it, including opposition to the proposed Space Corps and its failure to authorize new base realignments and closures. During debate on amendments to the NDAA this week, the House rejected a Republican-sponsored amendment that would have ended the Pentagon\u2019s policy of providing gender-reassignment surgery and other therapy for active-duty transgender service members. Lawmakers also defeated a proposed Republican amendment that would have prevented the Pentagon from implementing climate-change and green energy policies. ",

        "title": "Trump, anti-Trump forces start Florida ad battle",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign is buying commercial time on a TV station in West Palm Beach, Florida, taking on opponents in a paid media battle that the Republican front-runner has largely avoided so far. The March 15 nominating contest in Florida, a winner-take-all vote, is seen as one of the last chances to slow Trump\u2019s momentum after a string of victories on Super Tuesday. One SuperPAC allied with rival presidential candidate Marco Rubio has already shelled out millions in the state.  The race has become a fight between Trump and anti-Trump interests, which should drive new demand for ads, said Mark Egan, chief client officer of Maxus Americas, a media agency owned by GroupM. \u201cThe big war really starts now,\u201d he said.The billionaire candidate to date has relied heavily on free air time and Twitter, largely ignoring television. On Thursday he began purchasing commercial slots for the first time on West Palm Beach station WPTV, said Lloyd Bucher, vice president and general manager of the station, an NBC affiliate. He declined to discuss the amount.  SuperPACs that oppose Trump are gearing up in the state. Conservative Solutions, a SuperPAC allied with Rubio, has aired or distributed $4.8 million worth of ads and direct mail in Florida that explicitly opposes Trump, according to Federal Election Commission data from Friday through Tuesday. That is the most spent by a candidate-allied SuperPAC against Trump in a single state so far. TV stations in states with upcoming primaries are fielding more inquiries from outside groups opposing Trump, said Steve Lanzano, president and CEO of TVB, a trade body for television broadcasters.  \u201cYou are seeing a lot more SuperPACs coming out of the woodwork,\u201d he said. Election years typically provide windfalls for local TV stations as candidates blanket airwaves. Ad spending in the weeks leading up to the South Carolina primary was four times the level of 2012, Lanzano said.  Some media investors and analysts are concerned Trump may continue to rely mostly on free media exposure, which would hurt the revenues expected for local stations. Lanzano believes the Trump campaign will start buying more time to fight back against the attacks coming his way. \u201cI think he is going to spend a lot of money on advertising ultimately,\u201d Lanzano said. \u201cHe is going to get bombarded.\u201d  (Reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles, Jessica Toonkel in Hollywood, Florida, and Grant Smith in Washington; Editing by G Crosse, Peter Henderson and Andrew Hay) This article was funded in part by SAP.

        "title": "Trump spokesman sparks outcry by comparing Assad to Hitler",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House spokesman Sean Spicer triggered an uproar on Tuesday by saying Adolf Hitler did not use chemical weapons. He apologized after his comments drew immediate criticism on social media and elsewhere for overlooking the fact that millions of Jews were killed in Nazi gas chambers. Spicer made the assertion at a daily news briefing, during a discussion about the April 4 chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed 87 people. Washington has blamed the attack on the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \u201cYou had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn\u2019t even sink to using chemical weapons,\u201d Spicer said when asked about Russia\u2019s alliance with the Syrian government. The Nazis murdered six million Jews during World War Two. Many Jews as well as others were killed in gas chambers in European concentration camps. When a reporter asked Spicer if he wanted to clarify his comments, he said: \u201cI think when you come to sarin gas, there was no, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing.\u201d Later on Tuesday, Spicer apologized and said he should not have made that comparison. \u201cIt was a mistake. I shouldn\u2019t have done it and I won\u2019t do it again,\u201d Spicer told CNN in an interview. \u201cIt was inappropriate and insensitive.\u201d Spicer\u2019s assertion, made during the Jewish holiday of Passover, sparked instant outrage on social media and from some Holocaust memorial groups who accused him of minimizing Hitler\u2019s crimes.  \u201cSean Spicer now lacks the integrity to serve as White House press secretary, and President Trump must fire him at once,\u201d said Steven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect. Shortly after the White House briefing, Spicer emailed a statement to reporters in response to their queries, but had stopped short of offering an explicit apology.  \u201cIn no way was I trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust. I was trying to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers. Any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable,\u201d Spicer said in the statement. The U.S. Holocaust Museum did not mention Spicer\u2019s comments directly, but sent out a tweet shortly after the briefing that showed graphic footage of dead bodies U.S. forces found while liberating the Buchenwald concentration camp. The video was retweeted more than a thousand times, with many Twitter users referencing Spicer\u2019s comments. U.S. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called on Republican President Donald Trump to reject Spicer\u2019s assertion. \u201cSean Spicer must be fired, and the President must immediately disavow his spokesman\u2019s statements,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. The White House did not immediately respond when asked to comment on Pelosi\u2019s statement. It was not the first time the White House has had to answer questions about the Holocaust. Critics in January noted the administration\u2019s statement marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which omitted any mention of Jewish victims. At the time, Spicer defended that statement by saying it had been written in part by a Jewish staff member whose family members had survived the Holocaust. ",

An Istanbul prosecutor has indicted 18-year-old Itir Esen, who in September was stripped of her title after one day, for  publicly humiliating a segment of the society  following three official complaints over her tweet, Dogan reported.

Around 250 people, mostly unarmed civilians were killed and over 1,000 wounded in the failed coup bid on July 15, 2016. The day was later declared Democracy and National Unity Day and a public holiday in Turkey. More than 150,000 state employees have been suspended or sacked and over 50,000 have been jailed pending trial in a security crackdown following the attempted coup.

        "title": "Republicans strike back at new U.S. ban on forced arbitration",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans lawmakers on Tuesday started trying to kill a brand-new U.S. rule prohibiting banks and credit card companies from requiring customers who open new accounts to sign an agreement that they will not join a group lawsuit in the event of a dispute. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Monday finalized the new rule banning \u201cmandatory arbitration clauses\u201d requiring consumers to forego class-action suits and instead settle disputes in negotiations overseen by arbitrators frequently hired by companies. The rule immediately ran into fierce opposition by Wall Street and Republicans who control both Congress and the White House. They have long criticized the consumer agency, which is run by a Democrat, Richard Cordray. Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the Banking Committee, has already announced he is drafting a resolution to kill the rule. His fellow Republican Senator Pat Toomey, chair of the subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer protection, said he is considering a similar step.  Republican lawmakers plan to eliminate the rule, using a law that allows Congress to undo new regulations with simple majority votes in both chambers and a signature from the president. Analysts and consumer advocates have said the agency\u2019s rule may survive the Congressional challenge. Still, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is contemplating a legal challenge and Trump administration officials are also looking at ways to kill the rule. Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst for the investment firm Compass Point Research & Trading, said the rule has a slightly better than 50 percent chance of surviving in Congress. Joe Valenti, who tracks the issue for the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, said the House of Representatives was unified against the rule, which opponents have argued benefits class-action lawyers, not consumers. \u201cIt comes down to the Senate,\u201d said Valenti, noting that the rule would survive if only three Republicans in that chamber switched sides. That is possible, said Ed Mierzwinksi, the consumer program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Groups. He noted that Senate Republicans have struggled to gather enough votes for majorities and the calendar is swollen with pressing legislation and confirmation hearings. In addition, Mierzwinksi said, senators may be leery of appearing to side with Wall Street against consumers. He noted that Wells Fargo & Co used clauses in its account-opening agreements to block customers from suing over its phantom account scandal. Supporters of the rule say mandatory arbitration denies citizens their day in court and is rigged in favor of big firms. They say litigants banding together in a class-action lawsuit have a better chance of getting companies to answer publicly for illegal activities and that fears of such a suit can discourage law breaking. The consumer protection agency wrote the rule after conducting a lengthy, multi-year study of the issue. Opponents of the rule say the study is flawed and that arbitration is cheaper and faster than class-action lawsuits and produces better awards for consumers. The Chamber is exploring a prompt legal challenge to the rule, said Matt Webb, senior vice president for its legal reform institute. Another possible challenge could come from the acting comptroller of the currency, Keith Noreika. He is laying groundwork to invoke an untested provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law that allows the council of the country\u2019s top financial regulators to nullify a consumer agency rule if they decide it threatens the safety and soundness of the banking system. Rohit Chopra, senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America and former CFPB assistant director, said a lawsuit will probably fail because the law says the agency can restrict arbitration as long as it hews to its study.  He said the Dodd-Frank provision that the comptroller\u2019s office is looking at was meant to keep risks to the financial system at bay.  \u201cTo suggest that this rule would cause a financial crisis is ridiculous on its face,\u201d he said.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Georgia\u2019s two Republican senators broke with members of their party, saying they would consider Supreme Court nominees put forward by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton if she wins the presidency, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on Sunday. The comments from U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, who is up for re-election on Tuesday, and U.S. Senator David Perdue came after Republican Senators John McCain and Ted Cruz suggested they might block any of Clinton\u2019s potential nominees. \u201cYou don\u2019t shirk your responsibility when you\u2019re an elected official. You sanctify your responsibility, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll consider who she nominates at the time she does and make a decision that\u2019s right for the people of Georgia,\u201d Isakson told the Atlanta newspaper. A spokeswoman for Perdue, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told the AJC: \u201cHe wants to ensure we have a Supreme Court justice who will uphold the Constitution, and he will examine each nominee independently based on their merits.\u201d The death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February has left the nine-member high court short one justice and evenly split between liberals and conservatives. In March, President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a federal appeals court judge, to replace Scalia, but the Republican-led Senate has refused to consider the nomination, saying the next president should make the pick. The Senate\u2019s inaction on Garland, a centrist, has made the Supreme Court a potent issue in the election. After many years of leaning conservative, the court could tilt to the left for the first time in decades if Clinton wins the election. Isakson said he expects the Senate will confirm Garland before January in the event of a Clinton victory. Some Republicans fear Clinton would nominate a more liberal justice, swinging the ideological\u00a0balance of the court even further to the left. ",

        "text": "KISUMU, Kenya (Reuters) - Kenyan police in the western city of Kisumu fired tear gas and bullets in the air on Wednesday to disperse young men who broke into a hotel and beat women attending an election meeting, an officer said. Kenya held presidential, legislative and local elections on Aug. 8, but three weeks later the Supreme Court nullified the presidential result, citing irregularities in the tallying process. A re-run is scheduled for Oct. 17.  Although the ruling ushered in a period of uncertainty, many hope it will restore some faith in Kenya s tarnished institutions, reducing the long-term likelihood of political violence. On Wednesday, a Christian women s organization was holding a meeting related to the election re-run when the men broke into the hotel where they were meeting, said Joseph Keitany of the  Administration Police in Kisumu County. The region is a stronghold of opposition leader Raila Odinga.   We deployed police and they fired tear gas and bullets in the air and chased the group of young boys away,  he told Reuters.  The youth started beating women and they stole their laptops and money  before police arrived. A Reuters witness said the men smashed windows and broke chairs. Another witness said young men attacked participants using the broken chairs.   I was making my presentation when the youths came in,  said pastor Alice Atieno.  They started interrogating us and beating us on claims that we were buying IDs.  Keitany said he believed the men stormed the hotel because of rumors circulating on WhatsApp that the women s meeting was intended to plan the renting of voter identification cards, a rigging tactic alleged by the opposition ahead of last month s election, where online hoaxes and fake stories were alleged from all sides. Participants in the meeting denied that was the purpose and said they were meeting to see how to encourage peaceful voting.  A Reuters witness said he saw a Red Cross ambulance taking three women to hospital. In 2007, a disputed presidential vote led to protests and ethnic violence that killed 1,200 people. Following the August election, human rights organizations reported at least 28 deaths, mostly linked to police. But the protests were quelled when the opposition decided to take its complaints to court. Kenya s vocal civil society organizations have been working hard to plan monitoring and advocacy around the new vote.  The east African nation is the region s richest economy and a stable Western ally in a region roiled by conflict.  ",

        "title": "Guatemala top court sides with U.N. graft unit in fight with president",
        "text": "GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala s top court on Tuesday ruled definitively against President Jimmy Morales  internationally criticized push to expel the head of a U.N.-backed anti-corruption unit probing his campaign financing.      The decision by the Constitutional Court ratifies a provisional ruling that the government could not expel Ivan Velasquez, a veteran Colombian prosecutor who leads Guatemala s International Commission against Impunity, known as CICIG. Morales on Sunday ordered the expulsion of the prosecutor, who has been a thorn in the president s side by investigating his son and brother, and then seeking to remove his own immunity from investigation over more than $800,000 in potentially unexplained campaign funds. He has denied any wrongdoing.  Within the United Nations, Velasquez has the rank of assistant secretary general. He is widely respected and the president s moved unleashed a series of resignations from his cabinet and a storm of criticism from Western nations.  Earlier in the day, Morales, 48, said he would respect the court s decision, stepping back from brinkmanship he displayed at the weekend when he said the court had overstepped its mandate by ruling on the case.  He has sought support from Guatemala s mayors, possibly to try to counter the diplomatic pressure and street protests by activists calling him corrupt.   I am not defending corrupt people, I am not against the anti-corruption fight, I am not even against the CICIG. Is a machete good or bad? It depends on who is wielding it,  said the former comedian at a meeting with mayors. Morales won office in 2015 running on a platform of honest governance after his predecessor Otto Perez Molina was forced to resign and imprisoned in a multi-million dollar graft case stemming from a CICIG investigation.  The United Nations on Tuesday said it was  disturbed  by Morales  moves against Velasquez, while the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists said failure to comply with the Constitutional Court ruling could constitute  obstruction of justice , a criminal offense.   The president s decision to declare Ivan Velasquez as  non grata  and ordering his immediate removal from the country is in clear breach of international law,  the ICJ said in a statement.  Hundreds of Guatemalans took to the streets on Monday in support of Velasquez, some shouting  Take Jimmy Morales to court!  Some groups came out in support of the president and against foreign interference. The U.S. ambassador to Guatemala, Todd Robinson, told Reuters the president s moves could put at risk a U.S. development plan in Central America to reduce poverty and crime.  There will probably be consequences from the president s decision,  Robinson said, while emphasizing that any U.S. measures would have to be carefully thought through so as not to affect the economy or migration to the United States.     Many politicians in Guatemala consider the foreign-led body, which is unusual among U.N. bodies for its powers to bring cases to prosecutors, to be a violation of national sovereignty. Anti-corruption activists credit it with cleaning up government. ",

        "title": "Former Zimbabwe finance minister Chombo to be held in custody until trial",
        "text": "HARARE (Reuters) - Ousted Zimbabwe finance minister Ignatius Chombo, charged with three counts of corruption for offences that allegedly took place two decades ago, was denied bail on Monday and will be detained in custody until his case is heard on Dec. 8. Zimbabwe s new president Emmerson Mnangagwa named Patrick Chinamasa as acting finance minister to replace him. Chombo, who faces charges including trying to defraud the central bank, was detained after the military seized power in  Operation Restore Legacy , which it said was meant to remove  criminals  around former president Robert Mugabe. His lawyer, Lovemore Madhuku, told reporters that he would appeal the magistrate s ruling in the High Court on Tuesday.  Their decision was always made up that bail would not be granted here ... We are hopeful that the High Court will show independence,  Madhuku said.  Earlier, he told a packed courtroom that Chombo, who sat impassively throughout the hearing, would deny the charges at his trial and had documentary evidence showing the allegations had no basis. The magistrate who detained Chombo said the former minister could abscond, influence state witnesses or be the target of a mob attack over the allegations that he abused his position when he was minister of local government over a decade ago. Chombo, who was appointed finance minister in October, was among members of the G40 political faction allied to Mugabe and his wife, Grace, who were also expelled from the ruling ZANU-PF party. Two ousted ZANU-PF Youth League leaders, Kudzanai Chipanga and Innocent Hamandishe, who were both allied to G-40, were also ordered to be detained until Dec. 8. Some Mnangagwa supporters have called for unspecified action against G40 but the president has urged citizens not to undertake any form of  vengeful retribution . Chombo told the court on Saturday how he was abducted from his home on Nov. 15 by armed men in  soldiers  uniform  and kept blindfolded for nine days. He was promoted to the finance portfolio from the interior ministry by Mugabe in an October reshuffle, replacing Chinamasa, who the chief secretary to the president and cabinet said will return to the role until a new cabinet has been appointed. Zimbabwe is struggling with a severe shortage of the U.S. dollars it uses instead of its own currency. In his main act as finance minister, Chombo told parliament on Nov. 9 that Zimbabwe s budget deficit would soar to $1.82 billion or 11.2 percent of gross domestic product this year from an initial target of $400 million. Mnangagwa, who served Mugabe loyally for decades, was sworn in as president last Friday after the 93-year-old former leader quit under pressure from the military. He is expected to form a new cabinet this week. Zimbabweans are watching to see Mnangagwa he breaks with the past and names a broad-based government or selects other figures from the Mugabe era s old guard.   ",

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals previously upheld a Seattle judge\u2019s block of Trump\u2019s first travel order.

Trump signed the revised ban last month, in a bid to overcome legal problems with his January executive order that caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before its enforcement was halted in February. Trump has said the travel ban is needed for national security. The state of Hawaii challenged the revised travel directive as unconstitutional religious discrimination. Hawaii and other opponents of the ban claim it is based on Trump\u2019s election campaign promise of \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d The Justice Department has also appealed a ruling from a Maryland judge against Trump\u2019s revised executive order.

        "title": "Trump's Supreme Court appointee Gorsuch plots rightward course",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eight months into his lifetime U.S. Supreme Court appointment, Neil Gorsuch has given every indication through his votes in key cases and remarks from the bench he will be a stalwart of the conservative legal agenda, as President Donald Trump promised. Still early in his career as a justice that could span decades, Gorsuch has already established himself as among the most conservative members of the top U.S. court, and has not been shy about expressing his views, sometimes in idiosyncratic ways. He also has made public appearances before conservative audiences, including a speech at the Republican president\u2019s Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington, that have drawn rebukes by liberal critics who questioned his independence from the president who nominated him. Gorsuch\u2019s record so far suggests \u201che is going to be a reliably conservative vote,\u201d said Carolyn Shapiro, a law professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law. Trump, who as a candidate promised to pick a justice in the mold of the late conservative icon Antonin Scalia, has set out to move the federal judiciary to the right. Gorsuch\u2019s appointment has been his biggest step yet toward that goal, restoring the high court\u2019s 5-4 conservative majority. Gorsuch\u2019s April confirmation by the Republican-led Senate, despite strong Democratic opposition, provided one of Trump\u2019s  biggest political victories since taking office in January.  Writing about Gorsuch on Twitter on Tuesday, Trump said he was \u201cvery proud of him and the job he is doing,\u201d and rejected a Washington Post report that he had considered rescinding Gorsuch\u2019s nomination this spring after the jurist said attacks on the judiciary like those that had been made by Trump were \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201cdemoralizing.\u201d  The newspaper reported that Trump had vented angrily to advisers that Gorsuch may not be sufficiently loyal. Trump responded that he had \u201cnever even wavered.\u201d As the court rolls into 2018 with some big rulings ahead - on free speech, gay rights, voting rights and employee rights - legal experts said Trump will be able to rely on Gorsuch. The new justice has delivered key votes backing Trump\u2019s travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries and on the death penalty, and embraced certain kinds of public funding for churches. During arguments this month in one of the court\u2019s biggest cases of its current term, Gorsuch signaled sympathy for a conservative Christian baker who contends he was within his constitutional rights to refuse to create a wedding cake for a gay couple. Gorsuch declined an interview request for this article. Inside the Supreme Court chambers and outside it, Gorsuch, a 50-year-old Coloradoan, speaks his mind. \u201cHe is not intimidated about being the newest justice,\u201d said John Malcolm, a lawyer at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank. Gorsuch has regularly sided with his fellow conservative justices. In the legal fight over the three versions of Trump\u2019s travel ban, Gorsuch sided with the president on four different occasions. In June, he was one of three justices who would have let Trump\u2019s second travel ban go into full effect. The court voted 6-3 to allow a limited version of the ban. On the death penalty, Gorsuch was among four conservative dissenters when the court in September granted a stay of execution for a Georgia inmate. In April, in his first recorded vote on the court, he was part of a 5-4 conservative majority that declined a stay of execution request from an Arkansas inmate. The court in 2018 is set to rule on two cases - one from Wisconsin and another from Maryland - involving the practice of drawing legislative districts in states in a way intended to entrench one party in power, known as partisan gerrymandering. The rulings could influence U.S. elections for decades. Based on the Oct. 3 oral argument in the Wisconsin case, in which Democratic voters challenged a Republican-drawn electoral map, it is unclear how the court will rule. Gorsuch used a culinary analogy to express his doubts during the argument about the Democratic challengers\u2019 legal theory. \u201cIt reminds me a little bit of my steak rub,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cI like some turmeric, I like a few other little ingredients, but I\u2019m not going to tell you how much of each. And so what\u2019s this court supposed to do, a pinch of this, a pinch of that?\u201d During a November speech hosted by the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group, Gorsuch confidently touted his judicial ideology, stressing the importance of interpreting the U.S. Constitution based on its original meaning and narrowly reading the text of laws passed by Congress. \u201cTonight,\u201d he said to sustained applause, \u201cI can report, a person can be both a committed originalist and textualist and be confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d ",

        "text": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts police do not have the authority to detain illegal immigrants solely to buy time for federal law enforcement officials to take them into custody, the state\u2019s top court ruled on Monday. The decision amounts to a rejection of requests by the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency for courts and law enforcement agencies to hold illegal immigrants, who are facing civil deportation orders, in custody for up to 48 hours after their cases are resolved. The Supreme Judicial Court ruled that doing so amounts to a fresh arrest of the person that is not authorized by state law, in the first such ruling to apply to an entire state, according to Massachusetts\u2019 attorney general. \u201cMassachusetts law provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody,\u201d the court wrote in its decision. The case focused on Sreynuon Lunn from Cambodia. Federal officials said he entered the United States as a refugee in 1985 and was ordered deported to Cambodia in 2008 after a series of criminal convictions. Cambodia declined to accept him and he was released. Lunn was arrested in Boston last year on an unarmed robbery charge and ordered released in February after prosecutors failed to present a case. Federal ICE officials took him into custody while he remained in his holding cell, an event that made his case moot. The court agreed to hear the case on the premise that the issue would come up again. The U.S. Justice Department had argued that the 48-hour detainer requests reflected basic practices of cooperation between various law enforcement agencies. Attorneys for Lunn and the state had largely agreed that Massachusetts lacked the authority. \u201cThis decision allows local law enforcement to focus their resources on keeping people safe,\u201d said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, in a statement. U.S. President Donald Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a top priority of his administration. The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts praised the decision.    \u201cAt a time\u00a0when the Trump administration\u00a0is pushing aggressive and discriminatory immigration enforcement policies, Massachusetts is leading nationwide efforts by limiting how state and local law\u00a0enforcement assist,\u201d the group\u2019s executive director, Carol Rose, said in a statement.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee on Thursday approved a reauthorization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, nearly three years after the legislative authority for the country\u2019s commodities and swaps regulator expired. The head of the CFTC, Timothy Massad, praised the committee for clearing the way for the full Senate to vote on authorization. \u201cI am committed to continuing to work with Congress throughout this process, particularly on making sure end-users like agricultural producers can continue to safely and affordably use the derivatives markets, while ensuring these markets do not generate excessive risk to our financial system,\u201d he said in a statement.  The CFTC has operated on year-by-year funding since the end of 2013 because Congress has not passed a new authorization, which lawmakers say created uncertainty in many markets. The House of Representatives has already approved a similar bill. Republicans, who control the Senate, said the bill would allow farmers, ranchers and small energy providers to use derivatives for hedging operational costs without being ensnared in regulation intended to prevent the risky type of swap deals that contributed to the financial crisis.  The bill \u201callows for anticipatory hedges and the management of a hedge when it serves as a risk management tool for our producers and commercial end-users and not an investment or for speculation,\u201d said Committee Chairman Pat Roberts of Kansas. Still, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a proponent of strong Wall Street oversight, said the bill as written would also benefit financial players. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this bill is all about helping Wall Street traders and big energy companies like Koch Industries under the guise of helping farmers,\u201d he said. Massad\u2019s major concern involved funding. The senior Democrat on the committee, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, sought to add a provision that would create a model for backing the CFTC similar to that used for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which offsets taxpayer funds it receives with fees and fines. The proposal was not included in the final bill.  \u201cThe funding language proposed by Senator Stabenow addresses the fact that we are the only federal financial regulator without some form of fee-based funding,\u201d Massad said. Republican John Boozman of Arkansas, who has say over the CFTC\u2019s budget as chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on financial services, shot down the idea, describing funding tied to fines as a \u201cbounty program.\u201d ",

        "title": "Backs against the wall: Trump victory casts pall over Mexico",
        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico was pitched into deep uncertainty by Donald Trump\u2019s U.S. election victory on Tuesday after a bitterly divisive campaign, raising the prospect of major clashes over trade, immigration and security. The peso currency suffered its biggest fall in 22 years on fears Trump will stick to a campaign pledge to rewrite or dump a free trade treaty he says is loaded in Mexico\u2019s favor. Investors worry a trade fight could tip Mexico\u2019s economy into recession. The Republican candidate has threatened to deport millions of undocumented Mexican migrants, many of whom he described as rapists and drug runners, and to keep others out by building a massive border wall he says Mexico will pay for. Watching in homes and bars around the country as the New York real estate tycoon extended his lead over Democrat Hillary Clinton in one U.S. state after another, many Mexicans were gripped by disbelief and fear. \u201cWe have to start saving for that wall,\u201d said Rafael Garnica, a 29-year-old Mexico City technology entrepreneur. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Trump that frightens me, it\u2019s that he represents a huge amount of people in the United States.\u201d On Twitter, some Mexicans urged their government to seek dialogue with Trump, while others said they feared a rupture of ties with the United States. \u201cTrump\u2019s victory is the antithesis of the fall of the Berlin Wall,\u201d tweeted Fernando Belaunzaran, a politician for the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution.  Trump\u2019s victory coincided with the anniversary of the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall. Trump has proposed blocking billions of dollars in remittances sent home by Mexicans working in the United States to make Mexico pay for his border wall. Pena Nieto, who likened Trump\u2019s rhetoric to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, has dismissed the idea out of hand and his foreign minister reiterated on Wednesday the country had no intention of paying. On the campaign trail, Trump relentlessly attacked the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Mexico, Canada and the United States as the \u201cworst deal ever\u201d, vowing to scrap it if he cannot renegotiate it. NAFTA has been a cornerstone of Mexican economic policy since it took effect in 1994. Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said in a news conference on Wednesday that uncertainty and volatility had increased since Trump\u2019s win, but that there was no immediate impact on trade rules between the two countries. Some business leaders say the U.S and Mexican economies are now so closely integrated it is impossible to take steps against one without damaging the other. \u201cWe will be facing months of volatility and uncertainty while the new government in Washington takes office and we see whether Mr. Trump is able to make good on his unfortunate campaign promises and rhetoric,\u201d said Andres Rozental, a former Mexican deputy foreign minister. Mexican officials hope to diversify export markets to try to reduce the country\u2019s dependence on U.S. consumers, and Pena Nieto has said he would work with the winner of the election. He was pilloried at home for inviting Trump to Mexico in late August in an effort to create some leverage for his government in case the businessman won. Trump softened his tone on the brief stopover he made to meet Pena Nieto, telling a news conference it was important to keep manufacturing in North America and describing Mexican-Americans as \u201cspectacular, hard-working people.\u201d But within hours of his departure, he and Pena Nieto got into a Twitter feud over who would pay for the wall. After Trump\u2019s victory, Pena Nieto said on Twitter he was ready to work with him, calling the neighboring countries friends who \u201cshould continue to work together for the competitiveness and development of North America\u201d. Under NAFTA, four out of every five dollars made by Mexican exporters has come from the United States, and bilateral trade is now worth about half a trillion dollars annually. Trump has threatened to levy tariffs of up to 35 percent on Mexican-made goods, sparking fears of a massive hit to trade, especially in Mexico\u2019s northern border regions. The U.S. president has the power to rescind NAFTA but policymakers on both sides of the border consulted by Reuters said Trump would come under heavy pressure from Congress and business leaders not to wreck trade. Some Mexicans whose livelihoods are linked to the trade ties between the two countries also expressed hope that Trump\u2019s bark would be worse than his bite. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see, because there\u2019s no certainty that he\u2019s going to do everything that his campaign has been saying,\u201d said Jonathan Bola\u00f1os, night receptionist at the Hotel Fiesta Inn, based in an industrial park in the border city of Nogales. \u201cIt\u2019s true he was very aggressive, very tough, but sometimes people have to act that way to reach positions requiring charisma.\u201d Still, Mexican officials say Trump\u2019s hard line on trade blurs with his radical stance on immigration. \u201cTrump\u2019s wall isn\u2019t just a message to Mexico about migrants. It\u2019s about imports too,\u201d said a senior Mexican government security official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Friction over trade could put bilateral cooperation over security, the fight against drug trafficking and curbing illegal migration under strain, which U.S. and Mexican officials say has improved steadily under Pena Nieto and President Barack Obama. Mexico\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Carlos Sada, said at an event in Los Angeles last month that Trump had dealt a blow to the United States\u2019 image south of the border and stirred up historic resentment. Alongside him, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Roberta Jacobson, joked about how Trump\u2019s campaign had also made life difficult for U.S. diplomats south of the border. \u201cI thought about just hiding until November 9th,\u201d she said.    \u201cThe overwhelming, universal reaction to the Trump visit itself, and even to a lot in the election campaign, has been \u2018What the ... fff ... you know?\u2019\u201d \u201cBut the more concerning response, the much deeper response has been: \u2018We\u2019re afraid it won\u2019t go back to normal after this.\u2019\u201d ",

        "title": "Trump taps Kelly for Homeland Security, third general for top post",
        "text": "NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate a third retired general for a top job in his new administration with the choice of a battle-hardened Marine commander to lead the agency set up after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to protect the U.S. homeland.  Trump is expected to name former Marine General John Kelly, 66, as head of the Department of Homeland Security, a source familiar with the decision told Reuters on Wednesday. Kelly told Fox News on Wednesday that he has \u201cbeen asked and would consider it an honor.\u201d If confirmed by the Senate, Kelly will be in charge of the agency tasked with securing borders against illegal immigration, protecting the president, responding to natural disasters, coordinating intelligence and counterterrorism.  Like Trump, Kelly is believed to hold strong views on stopping illegal immigration. The four-star general told a congressional committee last year that the lack of security on the U.S.-Mexican border represents a national security threat.      As former head of the military\u2019s Southern Command, Kelly was responsible for U.S. military activities and relationships in Latin America and the Caribbean. He was a proponent of keeping open the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Kelly, whose son was killed fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, retired in January after a 45-year military career. CBS first reported that Trump would nominate Kelly to the position, which would put him in charge of more than 240,000 employees. Those include Secret Service and Border Patrol agents as well as the agency that clears refugees for resettlement in the United States. Under Democratic President Barack Obama, the department\u2019s Border Patrol and immigration enforcement agents were criticized by civil rights groups for acting as a paramilitary force that neglected the humanitarian mission of helping immigrants escaping violence. With a retired general as chief, the department risks furthering that image and facing backlash from Democrats and immigrant rights groups.  Trump energized voters in the election campaign by promising to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border in order to keep out Mexican immigrants he described as rapists and murderers.     In testimony last year before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Kelly said people-smuggling activities on the southern border were a dire threat.      \u201cTerrorist organizations could seek to leverage those same smuggling routes to move operatives with intent to cause grave harm to our citizens or even bring weapons of mass destruction into the United States,\u201d Kelly said.  Such sentiments may have endeared him to Trump, who warned repeatedly during his presidential campaign of dangers from illegal immigration, and pledged to make Mexico pay for the wall along the border. The Republican president-elect, who has no military experience, also plans to nominate retired General James Mattis to lead the Pentagon and picked retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn to be his national security adviser. Trump may be forced to look to generals to fill key positions because he lacks a relationship with Republican establishment figures, said former White House and State Department official P.J. Crowley.  \u201cHe never served in government, so until the campaign, he didn\u2019t have an established bench,\u201d said Crowley. \u201cHe\u2019s forming a pickup team on the fly. On an individual basis, they have a lot of international operational experience but far less domestic political experience. How well they will gel together remains to be seen,\u201d said Crowley, author of \u201cRed Line,\u201d a book on U.S. foreign policy. Trump\u2019s transition team is also said to be considering former Army General David Petraeus for secretary of state.  Kelly served in Iraq several times, and in 2003 was the first Marine in more than 50 years to be promoted to the rank of brigadier general while in a combat zone. In 2010, his son, Marine 1st Lieutenant Robert M. Kelly, was killed in Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan. Human rights groups had feared someone would be appointed to Homeland Security with a stronger anti-immigration position, such as Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who is a proponent of reinvigorating a system to track Muslims entering the United States on visas. Frank Sharry, executive director of America\u2019s Voice Education Fund, an immigrant rights advocacy group, said he was hopeful Kelly\u2019s experience in Central America would make him sympathetic to migrants fleeing violence in the region.  But Sharry said he was concerned over the number of generals Trump has appointed. \u201cAt times Trump\u2019s Cabinet looks like a military junta. There\u2019s been a securitization of migration that is out of whack with reality,\u201d said Sharry. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take a general with knowledge of the Americas over a radical like Kobach.\u201d The National Border Patrol Council, an early Trump backer that represents some 18,000 Border Patrol agents and other employees, noted that Kelly had no immigration experience but had \u201cstellar credentials.\u201d It said in a statement that his popularity with troops boded well for morale problems at the Department of Homeland Security, but added that \u201cwe believe no other cabinet level nominee will be under more pressure to produce.\u201d   Kelly questioned the Pentagon\u2019s decision to allow women to serve in combat, and differed publicly with Obama over the president\u2019s attempt to close the Guantanamo Bay prison. \u201cThere are no innocent men down there,\u201d Kelly said of Guantanamo in a January interview with the Military Times newspaper. The Republican-controlled Senate must confirm Kelly for the Homeland Security post.  ",

        "text": "HAVANA (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce met with Cuban President Raul Castro and in separate meetings with members of Castro\u2019s economic cabinet on Friday, as they prepare for the advent of a more hostile Trump administration next week. The chamber has been urging the Cuban government to sign a number of agreements with major companies such as General Electric (GE.N), negotiated over the last 18 months, before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. A brief government statement said chamber President Thomas Donohue and Castro discussed \u201cissues of mutual interest.\u201d \u201cThe goal of the U.S. business community has shifted from seeking more from Cuba to preserving what exists from the soon-to-be Trump administration,\u201d John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said. \u201c\u200eU.S. companies need the Cuban government to quickly and substantially expand its purchases of products and services and permit a highly visible presence of companies,\u201d he said. \u00a0 \u00a0 Donohue was accompanied by Maurice Greenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of C.V. Starr & Co Inc, a major U.S. insurance company. The chamber has opposed the U.S. trade embargo for decades and is a strong supporter of the normalization process begun by President Barack Obama. That process has included the signing of 17 agreements between the two former Cold War foes and the use of executive orders to punch holes in the embargo, which can be lifted only by the U.S. Congress, now controlled by Republicans. Travel to the Communist-run Caribbean island from the United States has increased, with the start of direct flights and cruises and roaming agreements signed, but there have been no manufacturing or trade deals inked. Cuba and the Obama administration have been scrambling to deepen and cement their detente, through bilateral agreements and commercial links, since Trump\u2019s election in November. Cuba agreed earlier this month to export charcoal to the United States, the first export in half a century, and in December Google (GOOGL.O) reached an agreement to place servers on the island to quicken access to its products. Trump has said he will dismantle the still-fragile detente unless Cuba gives the United States a better deal, while providing no specifics. Trump is expected to review Cuba policy upon taking office and has named Jason Greenblatt, a Trump Organization executive and chief legal counsel, as negotiator for sensitive international issues, including Cuba.

        "text": "KABUL (Reuters) - More than 60 percent of Afghans still believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, but signs of better governance and rebuilding has slightly lifted the national mood, according to a survey by the Asia Foundation. Just over half of the 10,000 people surveyed said they had confidence in President Ashraf Ghani s government, which has struggled to establish security in the face of a growing Taliban insurgency. Last year, just under half of Afghans said they had confidence in Ghani. However, nearly 39 percent of those surveyed said they would be willing to leave if they had the opportunity, the second highest figure in the survey s more than decade-long history. The main reason was increased security concerns. More than 70 percent of Afghans fear for their personal safety. Attacks are up across the country. In May, more than 150 people were killed by a blast in Kabul s diplomatic zone - one of the deadliest since the Taliban s ouster in 2001. On the day the survey was released, more than 20 policemen were killed in fighting with Taliban insurgents in the southern province of Kandahar. The survey which was conducted in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan in July, primarily in rural households, pointed to a mixed picture, with steady gains in education and health over the past decade and a half matched by continuing concern over corruption, unemployment and security. Around a third of Afghans, or 33 percent, believe the country was heading in a positive direction, up slightly from 29.3 percent last year to buck a years-long declining trend.  After a historic decline in 2016, confidence in public institutions has slightly improved; growing confidence in the Afghan National Security Forces stabilized in 2017,  Abdullah Ahmadzai, Asia Foundation s country representative in Afghanistan said in a statement. The increase in optimism applied across ethnic groups except Uzbeks, who make an important minority in Pashtun- and Tajik-dominated Afghanistan. While there was a slight rise in positive sentiment, it was down significantly from a peak in 2013 before the withdrawal of most foreign forces. Back then nearly 60 percent of Afghans were positive about their future. The survey comes as the United States in August announced a boost in U.S. troops to Afghanistan, which could push optimism higher in the coming months. ",

        "title": "U.S. state election officials still in the dark on Russian hacking",
        "text": "ANAHEIM, Calif. (Reuters) - The federal government has not notified U.S. state election officials if their voting systems were targeted by suspected Russian hackers during the 2016 presidential campaign, and the information will likely never be made public, a top state election chief told Reuters. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely never going to learn it, because we don\u2019t even know it,\u201d Judd Choate, state election director for Colorado and president of the National Association of State Election Directors, said in an interview on Thursday during the group\u2019s summer conference. Nearly 10 months after Republican Donald Trump\u2019s upset presidential victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton, Choate said he had not spoken to a single state election director who had been told by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security if their state was among those attacked. The lack of information-sharing on the election breaches reflects the difficulty state and federal officials have had in working together to protect U.S. voting from cyber threats. All U.S. elections are run by state and local governments, which have varying degrees of technical competence. DHS told Congress in June that 21 states were targeted during the 2016 presidential race, and that while a small number were breached, there was no evidence any votes were manipulated.  Other reports have said 39 states were targeted. Choate said he had heard both numbers mentioned. Several lawmakers, including Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, have expressed frustration at DHS\u2019 refusal to identify which states had been targeted. Arizona and Illinois confirmed last year that hackers had targeted their voter registration systems. In a statement, the DHS did not refute that states had not been notified if they were targeted, adding the agency informed the owners or operators of systems potentially victimized \u201cwho may not necessarily\u201d be state election officials.  DHS was working with senior state election officials \u201cto determine how best to share this information while protecting the integrity of investigations and the confidentiality of system owners,\u201d the agency said. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the Kremlin orchestrated an operation that included hacking and online propaganda intended to tilt the November election in Trump\u2019s favor. Several congressional committees are investigating and Special Counsel Robert Mueller is leading a separate probe into the Russia matter, including whether Moscow colluded with the Trump campaign. Russia has denied election meddling and Trump has denied any collusion. The four-day conference of election directors was originally supposed to be about issues like voter registration, but took a sharp turn following the election hacking. \u201cAfter the 2000 election, we all had to be lawyers,\u201d Choate said. \u201cAnd now after the 2016 election, we all have to be cyber security experts.\u201d DHS representatives at the event fended off questions about whether the federal government would be prepared to mobilize sufficient support for the states in the event of a catastrophic cyber attack near or during the 2018 elections.  \u201cWe want to make sure we learn from the missteps that may have happened in 2016 and we want to make sure we continue building on the things we did that were right,\u201d Robert Gatlin, a DHS cyber official, said during a panel discussion. Gatlin said the agency was working with U.S. intelligence agencies to \u201cdowngrade\u201d more classified information so it could be shared with the states. Information about cyber attacks is typically guarded by a high classification because it may involve nation-state involvement or contain sensitive sources and methods, he said. Legislation recently approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee would require the director of national intelligence to sponsor top-secret security clearance for eligible election officials in each state, something the National Association of Secretaries of State has advocated. The bill would also require DHS to submit a report to Congress detailing cyber attacks and attempted cyber attacks by foreign governments on U.S. election infrastructure during the 2016 election. Choate said communication about cyber threats had improved with federal agencies since the election and the decision by the outgoing Obama administration in January to elevate voting systems to a \u201ccritical infrastructure designation.\u201d  Prior to the election, some state officials worried that closer oversight of election systems represented a dangerous federal intrusion into local affairs.

        "title": "House committee questions head of Trump campaign data firm: sources",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee on Thursday interviewed the head of a data analysis firm to determine whether Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign team sought his help to find thousands of emails missing from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server, three sources familiar with the session said. Trump\u2019s campaign hired Alexander Nix and the company, Cambridge Analytica, in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million through last December, according to Federal Election Commission records. The month after his firm was hired, Nix emailed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange for help tracking down some 33,000 emails that Clinton supposedly had deleted from her private server, the Daily Beast and The Wall Street Journal reported in October. Nix wanted to convert the missing and potentially damaging emails into a searchable database for use by the Trump campaign or a pro-Trump political action committee, the Journal reported.  WikiLeaks confirmed to Reuters on Thursday that it was approached by Nix, but a representative said it turned down his request.     The intelligence committee is investigating possible collusion between Trump\u2019s campaign team and Russia during the 2016 election. The matter is also being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and three other congressional committees. Russia has denied meddling in the election, and Trump has said there was no collusion between Moscow and his campaign.   Representatives Elijah Cummings and Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrats on the House Oversight and Judiciary committees, on Thursday asked their Republican committee chairmen to issue subpoenas for documents from Cambridge Analytica and Giles-Parscale, another data analysis firm that worked for the Trump campaign. Spokesmen for Cambridge Analytica and Giles-Parscale did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment.\u00a0         Cummings and Nadler said they sent their letter after the two companies declined to answer questions about whether they had contacts with foreign actors during the 2016 presidential campaign. The sources said the intelligence committee members met at a Washington law office on Thursday to conduct the interview with Nix by Skype because he was not in the United States. The sources said the interview lasted some 90 minutes. The CIA, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency said in January that Russia used propaganda, social media and other means to meddle in the 2016 election to try to help Trump defeat Clinton.         In their report, the agencies said Russian intelligence services hacked emails and other documents from the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic Party organizations, and used Wikileaks to release them.

        "title": "'Rage against the machine': U.S. voters reject a 'rigged' system",
        "text": " (This November 9th story has been refiled to clarify that Keyes comment in 3rd paragraph from end was said in jest) By Andy Sullivan and Michelle Conlin WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a bitterly divisive presidential election, at least one thing united U.S. voters: a feeling that the country\u2019s economic and political systems were tilted against them. A Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll of 45,000 voters found an electorate burning with resentment against Wall Street, politicians and the news media, increasingly alienated from a country that is changing in ways it doesn\u2019t like. This sense of alienation transcended partisan boundaries, uniting supporters of Republican victor Donald Trump and his  Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. \u201cThis is rage against the machine,\u201d said Carrie Sheridan, a former supporter of Democratic President Barack Obama, as fellow Trump supporters celebrated the real-estate mogul\u2019s victory early Wednesday by pouring champagne on each other at his $200 million luxury hotel near the White House. Some 75 percent of poll respondents, Republicans and Democrats alike, agreed that the country needs a \u201cstrong leader\u201d to take the country back from the rich and powerful.  Seven out of ten agreed that the economy is \u201crigged\u201d to benefit wealthy insiders. Most backed the notion that their leaders were out of touch: 77 percent of Trump supporters and 56 percent of Clinton supporters agreed that traditional politicians didn\u2019t care about people like them. (Graphic of Reuters/Ipsos poll: tmsnrt.rs/2ffJJ9A)  This sense of disconnection ran deepest among Trump supporters. Some 73 percent agreed with the idea that \u201cmore and more, I don\u2019t identify with what America has become,\u201d while 61 percent said they felt like strangers in their own country. Most Clinton supporters said they didn\u2019t share those sentiments. Nine out of ten Trump supporters said mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth.  Trump, who travels in his own 757 jet, might seem like an unlikely candidate to benefit from this anti-elite sentiment.  But by 8 p.m. Eastern time, lines had formed at the velvet ropes by 8 p.m. Eastern time outside Trump\u2019s new hotel in between the White House and the U.S. Capitol, where a steak costs $60 and wine is sold by the spoonful.  \u201cThese are shadow voters, voters who have never voted before,\u201d said Preston Parry, 20, who was watching the results with a throng of friends, all of them wearing suits and Trump campaign trucker hats. Despite his gilded lifestyle, Trump capitalized on working-class fears of a rapidly changing country. Styling himself as a \u201cblue-collar billionaire,\u201d he promised to bring back manufacturing jobs back to forgotten factory towns and sharply curtail immigration.  He drew overwhelming support from white working-class voters in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, winning enough states to capture the White House even as he lost the popular vote. Trump\u2019s scathing characterization of Clinton as a corrupt career politician also resonated in an year when many voters said they were primarily casting a vote against one of the candidates. Some 46 percent of Trump supporters said they backed him because they didn\u2019t want Clinton to win, while 40 percent of Clinton supporters said they were motivated primarily to stop Trump from reaching the White House.  Those who made up their minds in the last week of the campaign were more likely to cite opposition to one of the candidates as their main reason for voting. Politicians like Clinton are \u201ctaking away from what we were as a country and saying we should change because of the people coming in, the immigrants and refugees,\u201d said John Scherer, a 57-year-old former maintenance worker in Portsmouth, Ohio. Scherer\u2019s sentiments were widely shared by Trump supporters, as 72 percent agreed with the idea that immigrants threaten traditional American beliefs and customs. Three-quarters of Clinton backers, by contrast, said immigrants strengthened U.S. society. The Reuters/Ipsos Election Day poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states, including more than 45,000 people who already voted in the presidential election. Voter dissatisfaction isn\u2019t exactly new. Surveys have consistently found since 2002 that most people believe the country is on the wrong track, a period that encompasses a Republican and Democratic president, two wars, a deep recession and a slow recovery. Trump supporters were more likely to share this frustration. Some 70 percent who backed the Republican real-estate mogul said they felt the country was on the wrong track, while only 23 percent of Clinton supporters agreed, according to the Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll. Those figures could quickly turn on their head as the reality of a Trump presidency sinks in. Across the country, Clinton supporters used unusually harsh language when describing the election result.  In Washington, D.C., non-profit manager Trisha Postyuk said she saw her vote for Clinton as \u201ca triumph over evil.\u201d  In St. Petersburg, Florida, cafe owner Amanda Keyes, 33, said racist and sexist attitudes are going to take many years to overcome. \u201cMisogyny will continue to bubble through the country but I can only hope that the old people will die,\u201d she said jokingly. At Trump\u2019s hotel, a couple from Atlanta looked at a text message from a friend who had bet them $100 that Trump would lose.  \u201cPlease don\u2019t ever text me again,\u201d the message said.

        "title": "Palin's endorsement fails to excite Trump rallygoers",
        "text": "NORWALK, Iowa (Reuters) - When it comes to influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential race, Sarah Palin\u2019s star power is turning out to be dimmer than expected.  There was no ecstasy in the crowd when the former Alaska governor and vice presidential nominee endorsed Republican front-runner Donald Trump at a rally in Ames, Iowa, on Tuesday night. And at Trump\u2019s next appearance on Wednesday in Norwalk, people who came to see him - both hard-core Trump supporters and undecided voters - said Palin was not swaying them. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to do an image remake of her,\u201d said Joani Estes, 56, of Indianola, Iowa. Estes said her Pentecostal Christian faith made her feel aligned with Palin, but it did not make her feel any more strongly about Trump. She liked him, she said, and was likely going to caucus for him during the state\u2019s nominating contest on Feb. 1 - but she was also keeping the door open for his closest rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Her friend Jenny Terrell, 55, said Palin\u2019s endorsement made her less certain about her support for Trump. A longtime Democrat, Terrell said she had been inspired by Trump but was put off by Palin\u2019s extreme opposition to abortion rights.  \u201cI was a little disappointed,\u201d she said, adding that even though she knew Trump had declared himself to be against abortion, she did not see him as being as fervently anti-abortion as Palin. As a strategic move in Trump\u2019s competition against Cruz in Iowa, getting an endorsement from Palin made sense, political experts said. She is popular among tea party Republicans who rail against the political establishment, as well as blue-collar evangelical Christians, two groups from which Cruz draws strong support.  It is not yet clear whether evangelical leaders in the state will follow Palin\u2019s lead and choose Trump over Cruz. But Trump had already managed to draw some of those voters with his brash, sweeping talk of keeping refugees out of the United States, building a wall along the Mexican border to stop illegal immigration, and putting education policy back in the hands of local communities.  \u201cI could care less\u201d about Palin\u2019s support for Trump, said Scott Heckart, 49, who said he had made up his mind to caucus for the billionaire businessman and former reality TV star.  Even Andrew Haup, 26 - who said he decided to support U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, only after McCain made Palin his running mate - said her endorsement mattered little to him since he had already made up his mind to support Trump. Near the back of the room where Trump spoke on Wednesday morning, Matt Burns, 47, a Cruz supporter, stood alone. He said he had only come to see Trump because his teenage daughter had asked him to take her. He said he liked Palin and was not angry at her for choosing Trump over Cruz, but said her choice was not going to sway him. \u201cFor me it doesn\u2019t really do a whole lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI think most people know who they\u2019re going to caucus for.\u201d  (Reporting By Emily Flitter; Editing by Jonathan Oatis) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.",

        "title": "Exclusive: U.S. congressional committee demands answers on WHO cancer agency",
        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - The chairman of a U.S. congressional committee investigating taxpayer funding of a World Health Organization cancer agency has asked U.S. health officials to release crucial documents. In a letter seen by Reuters and sent on Thursday to the head of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz questioned whether the WHO\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) was trying to \u201cavoid public scrutiny\u201d by asking its experts not to disclose requested information. IARC staff were not immediately available for comment. An NIH spokeswoman could not confirm the receiving the letter, but said the agency would respond if and when it arrived. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which Chaffetz chairs, began looking into the NIH\u2019s links with IARC last year after several lawmakers raised questions about why U.S. taxpayers are funding an agency that often faces criticism for its work. The letter marks the latest salvo in a battle between Congress, NIH and IARC that was fueled by IARC\u2019s review of the weedkiller glyphosate.  IARC classifies glyphosate, a key ingredient of Monsanto Co\u2019s herbicide Roundup, as \u201cprobably carcinogenic.\u201d That assessment puts IARC at odds with many government regulators, including those in the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and New Zealand, who say it is unlikely to pose a cancer risk to humans.         Last year, IARC advised academic experts on its glyphosate review panel not to disclose documents they were asked to release under United States freedom of information laws. Chaffetz also sent a separate letter on Thursday to the National Archives and Records Administration office, asking for clarification of federal records law, specifically relating to information sent between a foreign body and a U.S. government email account. IARC is semi-autonomous part of the WHO based in Lyon, France. Its assessments of whether such things as coffee, mobile phones, processed meat and glyphosate cause cancer have caused particular controversy in recent years. IARC\u2019s critics say the agency is sometimes too quick to conclude that substances might cause cancer, prompting unnecessary health scares.  IARC, however, defends its methods as scientifically sound and says its monographs - the name it gives its classifications of carcinogens - are \u201cwidely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and ... freedom from conflicts of interest.\u201d Chaffetz originally wrote to NIH director Francis Collins in September last year describing IARC as having \u201ca record of controversy, retractions, and inconsistencies\u201d and asking why the NIH, which has an annual budget of $33 billion, continues to fund it. In Thursday\u2019s follow-up letter, Chaffetz noted that IARC had since then told some of its working group members to not release documents to the Congressional committee. Now, Chaffetz said, the committee wanted access to all IARC employee communications related to public records requests, and other documents. In both letters, Chaffetz asks for a response by Jan. 24.

        "text": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland is open to adding to a tentative Irish border agreement that collapsed on Monday but movement will be needed by the end of the week if Brexit talks are to move onto the next phase this year, the country s European Affairs Minister said on Wednesday. A deal on the border, which is required if negotiations are to progress to trade talks, was agreed on Monday with Dublin s blessing after Brexit negotiators guaranteed  regulatory alignment  on both sides of the border that Ireland shares with the British province of Northern Ireland.  While the Northern Irish party propping up the British government rejected the deal, Dublin insists it will not accept any change to the substance of the agreement ahead of a meeting of EU leaders on Dec. 15 to decide whether to open trade talks.  The text that has been agreed, we feel it s appropriate, it s workable, there is compromise on both sides and addresses our concerns of upholding what we ve all been asking for, that there would be no return to a hard border,  Helen McEntee told Reuters in an interview.  If there is clarification needed on the text, if there is possibly additional wording that would clarify what s already in the text that would be agreeable to us... I wouldn t see how that would be a problem.  The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has said it cannot allow any divergence in regulation between Northern Ireland and other parts of the United Kingdom. Dublin is waiting for the British government to come back to the EU s negotiating team with any suggestions or a request for further clarity, McEntee said. EU diplomats and officials say Britain must deliver its Brexit divorce package offer this week and McEntee added that if it s felt by Monday that a deal is not going to happen, then she would expect chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to inform the General Affairs Council of EU ministers of that a day later. However, she said the huge amount of work officials put in last weekend to bring the sides to the brink of a deal on Monday showed how much progress can be made in a few short days.  Realistically you would want things to be moving by the end of the week and there to be some sort of agreement coming into the general affairs council,  she said.   I think the fact that it was agreed shows most people were happy with that and I think it s just to move from there and I would be hopeful that we would be able to reach that agreement by next week.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Representative Trent Franks said on Thursday he would resign after two female staffers complained that he had discussed surrogacy with them. Franks, 60, who has been a member of Congress from Arizona since 2003, said in a statement that he would step down on Jan. 31. The House of Representatives Ethics Committee said on Thursday it had opened an investigation into accusations of sexual harassment against Franks. The congressman said he was resigning because coverage of the committee\u2019s investigation in the \u201ccurrent cultural and media climate\u201d would \u201cdamage those things I love most.\u201d Franks said he and his wife had struggled with infertility and sought a surrogate in order to have another child after they had twins with a surrogate. \u201cI have recently learned that the Ethics Committee is reviewing an inquiry regarding my discussion of surrogacy with two previous female subordinates, making each feel uncomfortable,\u201d Franks said. \u201cI deeply regret that my discussion of this option and process in the workplace caused distress,\u201d he said. Franks denied he ever \u201cphysically intimidated, coerced, or had, or attempted to have, any sexual contact with any member of my congressional staff.\u201d U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan was briefed on the allegations on Nov. 29 and urged Franks to resign in a conversation the following day, Ryan\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cThe speaker takes seriously his obligation to ensure a safe workplace in the House,\u201d the statement said. Franks, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, represents Arizona\u2019s 8th Congressional District, a mainly suburban area of Phoenix. He won re-election in 2016 with 68.5 percent of the vote. Republican President Donald Trump carried the district by 21 points last year.  Republican Arizona Governor Doug Ducey will call a special election to fill the seat. The nominating primary must be held between 80 and 90 days after the vacancy and the general election must be conducted 50 to 60 days after the primary, according to state law. Numerous prominent men in U.S. politics, media and entertainment have been accused in recent months of sexual harassment and misconduct.  Earlier on Thursday, Democratic Senator Al Franken of Minnesota said he would resign in a few weeks following allegations of sexual misconduct. U.S. Democratic Representative John Conyers of Michigan resigned on Tuesday after accusations of sexual harassment were leveled against him. Conyers denied the allegations, while Franken said some of the accusations against him were untrue and he remembered other incidents differently from his accusers. Reuters has not verified the allegations against either man. ",

        "title": "Report on MH370 finds 'initially similar' route on pilot's flight simulator",
        "text": "SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The captain of the Malaysian Airlines aircraft that vanished somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean with 239 people on board had flown a route on his home flight simulator six weeks earlier that was  initially similar  to the one actually taken, Australian authorities said on Tuesday.  The details were contained in a 440-page final report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) on the unsuccessful search for flight MH370.  The disappearance of the Boeing 777 on March 8, 2014, on a flight to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, has become one of the world s greatest aviation mysteries. The report concluded that the reasons for the loss of the aircraft could not be established with certainty until the aircraft was found.  It is almost inconceivable and certainly societally unacceptable in the modern aviation era...for a large commercial aircraft to be missing and for the world not to know with certainty what became of the aircraft and those on board,  the ATSB said. The aircraft was thought to have been diverted thousands of miles off course out over the southern Indian Ocean before crashing off the coast of Western Australia. Australia, which led the underwater hunt, and Malaysia and China called off a A$200 million ($160 million) search for the plane in January, despite the protests of families of those onboard.   Six weeks before the aircraft s disappearance, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah used his home simulator to fly a route that was initially similar to part of the route flown by MH370 up the Strait of Malacca, with a left-hand turn and track into the southern Indian Ocean, the ATSB said in its report.  By the last data point the aircraft had flown approximately 4,200 nautical miles,  the report said.  This was further than was possible with the fuel loaded on board the aircraft for flight MH370.  The simulated aircraft track was also inconsistent with those modeled using satellite signal data from MH370, the report said.  However, the ATSB said there were enough similarities to the flight path of MH370 for the agency to carefully consider the possible implications for the underwater search area, including whether it glided after fuel exhaustion or was ditched in a controlled manner.  Aircraft debris found later indicated the flaps were most likely retracted, which wasn t consistent with a controlled ditching, the report said. Australia s main scientific agency said in August it believes with  unprecedented precision and certainty  that the plane crashed northeast of the search zone. But those findings were dismissed by Australia s government at the time as not specific enough, and the search has not been re-opened. Doing so depends on finding credible, new evidence about the plane s whereabouts. The ATSB report published on Tuesday detailed the unsuccessful 1,046-day hunt for the plane, above and below the surface of the Indian Ocean, and scientific analyses of satellite pictures, sea currents and even barnacles found clinging to a piece of the plane found on Reunion Island.  The understanding of where MH370 may be located is better now than it has ever been. The underwater search has eliminated most of the high probability areas,  the ATSB said.  We...deeply regret that we have not been able to locate the aircraft, nor those 239 souls on board that remain missing.  It recommends aircraft and aircraft equipment manufacturers investigate providing better methods of automated satellite tracking for planes if they encounter problems during flight in future. Malaysia has continued to investigate the plane s whereabouts and in August said it received an offer from a private seabed exploration firm, Ocean Infinity, to resume the search.     Malaysian investigators said in 2015 there was nothing suspicious in the financial, medical or personal histories of pilots or crew.

        "title": "Supreme Court vacancy upends presidential race ",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The sudden and shocking death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia opened a new and incendiary front in the already red-hot 2016 presidential race, one that promises to divide Democrats and Republicans and, perhaps, Republicans from themselves.  The vacancy on the court, which is now evenly split 4-4 between its conservative and liberal wings, had Republicans calling on President Barack Obama to refrain from choosing a successor to the right-leaning Scalia while Democrats urged Obama to do as the U.S. Constitution requires and put forward a candidate to face confirmation in an albeit hostile Senate. The prospect of such a battle drew swift and furious comment from candidates vying to be elected president in November. Facing off in a debate only hours after the 79-year-old Scalia\u2019s death was announced, some Republican presidential candidates seized the moment to caution voters that their party\u2019s front-runner, billionaire businessman Donald Trump, could not be trusted to nominate a stalwart conservative.  \u201cIf Donald Trump is president, he will appoint liberals,\u201d charged U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas during the debate in South Carolina, which holds a Republican nominating contest  next Saturday. \u201cTwo branches of government hang in the balance, not just the presidency, but the Supreme Court,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIf we get this wrong, if we nominate the wrong candidate, the Second Amendment, life, marriage, religious liberty, every one of those hangs in the balance.\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina also took a shot at Trump. \u201cDonald Trump is not a conservative, so I don\u2019t trust him to pick a judge,\u201d Graham said before the debate. A real estate mogul, Trump has supported Democratic politicians in the past. Trump, who also has taken several positions at odds with Republican orthodoxy, joined other candidates at the debate in insisting that Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican majority leader in the Senate, stand by his promise to block any Obama high court choice.  \u201cIt\u2019s up to Mitch McConnell and everyone else to stop it,\u201d Trump, a former reality TV show host, said. \u201cIt\u2019s called delay, delay, delay.\u201d Under the U.S. system, the president nominates justices for the nine-member court and the Senate confirms them. The last justice to be approved by the Senate of the opposite party during an election year was Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988.  Obama has already indicated that he intends to send a choice to the Senate in coming weeks, meaning that the nominee will be heavily scrutinized by presidential candidates in both parties - and more than likely be opposed by the majority of Republicans.  \u201cThe court may genuinely be a major issue this year,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former top political adviser to Obama. \u201cIt will be a hell of a fight.\u201d Criticism of the court, which in recent years has upheld Obama\u2019s sweeping healthcare plan and legalized same-sex marriage, has already been a thread running through several Republican candidates\u2019 campaigns.  The conservative majority on the court had appeared poised to invalidate Obama\u2019s immigration and climate-change policies. The loss of Scalia, considered to be a lodestar of conservative legal thought, and the potential swing of the court to the left, ensures that whatever drama plays out in the Senate this year will be mirrored on the campaign trail. \u201cThere is no more clarifying debate in politics these days than when it comes to Supreme Court nominees,\u201d said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. \u201cThis now is for all the marbles.\u201d Reid was majority leader of the Senate when it confirmed previous Obama court nominees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Manley called McConnell\u2019s threat not to allow a vote on a potential Scalia replacement \u201ccompletely beyond the pale.\u201d Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton seemed inclined to make McConnell\u2019s threat a campaign issue.  \u201cThe Republicans in the Senate and on the campaign trail who are calling for Justice Scalia\u2019s seat to remain vacant dishonor our Constitution,\u201d Clinton said in a statement.  Axelrod said that the issue could help Clinton, locked in a tight race with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.  \u201cI think it will make electability and experience in this realm more important,\u201d he said.   Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, and a longtime observer of the Supreme Court nomination process, said Obama likely has two options. \u201cHe could nominate a more liberal candidate who would have no real chance of getting through a Republican Senate - in which case this would become a salient political issue in 2016,\u201d Hasen said. Or he could nominate a more moderate candidate who might gain enough Republican support to gain approval, he said.  There are risks to both approaches: A Republican obstruction of a liberal nominee would animate the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive base in an election year but would leave the court without a potentially tie-breaking vote for perhaps a year. That same Democratic base might view a moderate nominee as a betrayal, while conservative Republican voters likely would frown on any senator who voted to approve an Obama choice.  Manley said that McConnell has already shown that he is unwilling to support any choice made by Obama and that the White House must act aggressively. \u201cThe president should go forward and nominate the most liberal candidate possible,\u201d he said.  Given the need to fire up its most passionate voters, that might just be exactly what Republican candidates want as well.

        "title": "U.S. Navy chief says forces in Asia may be reinforced with warships from the eastern Pacific",
        "text": "YOKOSUKA (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy s top officer on Tuesday said that vessels from eastern Pacific could be brought forward to reinforce U.S. naval power in Asia as Washington contends with increased threats in the region and accidents that have weakened its maritime force.  We will continue to assure that we meet all of our missions here in the Asia Pacific area. It could be something coming forward from Third Fleet or something like that to meet those requirements,  Chief of U.S. Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson said at a briefing aboard the USS Ronald Reagan carrier in Japan. He declined to say when or how many ships could be transferred. The growing threat posed by North Korea s ballistic missile and nuclear weapon advances coupled with operations to counter China s increasing military might in the South China Sea and other parts of Asia is putting an increased burden on the U.S. Seventh Fleet.  That added pressure on crews has been blamed for contributing to a series of accidents involving naval vessels this year including collisions by two destroyers with merchant ships that killed 17 U.S. sailors. In August the USS John S.McCain guided missile destroyer was struck by a merchant ship near Singapore, while its sister ship, the Fitzgerald, almost sank off the coast of Japan in June after colliding with a Philippine container ship.  Richardson spoke after U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a new national security strategy based on his  America First  vision that singled out China and Russia as  revisionist powers.  For its part, China is attempting to revise the global status quo by its aggression in the South China Sea, a U.S. official said. Beijing is building military bases there on manmade islands in waters claimed by other nations.   One can only draw certain conclusion about what are the intentions of the Chinese with respect to those islands. We will respond as we have always done, which is that we are going to continue to be present down there,  Richardson said.  For now, he said, North Korea was the  most urgent  task for the U.S. Navy in Asia as it became  more and more capable  with every new missile test. The latest ballistic missile tested on Nov. 29 reached an altitude of more than 4,000 kilometers (2485.48 miles), giving it enough-range, Pyongyang claims, to hit major U.S. cities including Washington D.C.  Richardson said his task in 2018 is to build a navy  more lethal  and  dangerous  to potential U.S. foes.   There is a near unanimous consensus that we need more naval power than we have now,  he said. ",

        "title": "China urges Thailand to find Muslim Uighurs quickly after dramatic cell break",
        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday it has urged Thailand to  quickly bring to justice  20 ethnic Uighur Muslims from China who broke out of a Thai detention center through a hole in the wall, using blankets to climb to the ground. Twenty-five Uighurs dug through their cell wall with broken tiles to make their dramatic escape from the center in Thailand s southern Songkhla province, near the border with Malaysia, early on Monday.  As of Tuesday, 10 had been caught, leaving 15 whose whereabouts were still unknown, according to Thai police, who said checkpoints had been set up along the border. The escapees were part of the last remaining group of more than 200 Uighurs detained in Thailand in 2014.  Members of the group identified themselves as Turkish citizens and asked to be sent to Turkey but more than 100 were forcibly returned to China in July 2015, a move that sparked international condemnation, including from rights groups who feared they could face torture in China. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China would continue to strengthen cooperation with Thailand on the detainees  escape and closely follow the situation.   China has already urged the relevant Thai department to quickly bring the relevant people to justice,  he said at a regular news briefing. Over the years, hundreds, possibly thousands, of Turkic-language speaking Uighurs have escaped unrest in China s western region of Xinjiang by traveling clandestinely via Southeast Asia to Turkey. The Chinese government has blamed violence in Xinjiang between majority Han Chinese and Uighurs on separatist Islamist militants, though rights groups and exiles say that anger over strict Chinese controls on the religion and culture of Uighurs is to blame. Exiled ethnic Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer called on Thailand and any country that may find the Uighurs to treat them according to international law and not hand them over to China.  The Uyghurs took the risk of capture and perhaps harsh repercussions to try to save themselves from indefinite detention in Thailand and from deportation to China,  Kadeer said in an email released by the World Uyghur Congress, which she heads.  [Whether they] are indeed Turkish nationals as they claim or Chinese nationals as China claims, the fact that they are ethnic Uyghur is enough for them to face persecution and harsh punishment,  she said. Kadeer is a former political prisoner in China accused of leaking state secrets in 1999. She was later allowed to leave on medical grounds and lives in the United States. Amnesty International has said that Chinese authorities in recent months have detained up to 30 of Kadeer s relatives. China routinely denies accusations of rights abuses in Xinjiang, though it has admitted a problem with torture of detainees and has pledged to stop mistreatment of prisoners. On the borders of Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan, the region is one of China s most sensitive domestic issues, and the government has dramatically ramped up police operations there and set up what critics characterize as  re-education  camps and oppressive surveillance.

        "title": "Jane Goodall urges U.S. Senate to halt quest for Arctic refuge oil",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - British primatologist Jane Goodall sent a letter to every U.S. senator on Tuesday urging them to oppose a push in the U.S. Congress to allow oil drilling in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a region environmentalists say is one of the world\u2019s last paradises. The Republican-led Senate is trying to open up the 1002 region on the coastal plain of the ANWR, a region inhabited by Gwich\u2019in natives, caribou herds, polar bears and millions of birds that migrate to six of the world\u2019s seven continents. \u201cIf we violate the Arctic Refuge by extracting the oil beneath the land, this will have devastating impact for the Gwich\u2019in people for they depend on the caribou herds to sustain their traditional way of life,\u201d Goodall said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. The ANWR\u2019s \u201cvery wildness speaks to our deeply rooted spiritual connection to nature, a necessary element of human psyche,\u201d wrote Goodall, best known for her study of chimpanzees in Tanzania. Last week, a group of 37 U.S.-based scientists whose research focuses on Arctic wildlife asked senators to not open the ANWR, saying that drilling would be \u201cincompatible with the purposes for which the refuge was established.\u201d The Senate energy committee on Wednesday will consider a bill spurred by Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska and the head of the panel, to hold at least two lease sales in the ANWR over the next 10 years.  Some Native Alaskans support drilling believing it will provide jobs. Matthew Rexford, a member of the I\u00f1upiat tribe and the tribal administrator of the village of Kaktovik, has said he believes technological advances mean drilling can be performed with little impact to the land.   The administration of President Donald Trump is pursuing a policy to make the country \u201cenergy dominant\u201d by maximizing oil, gas and coal production. Republicans say the 1002 portion of the ANWR is a \u201cnon wilderness area\u201d because the government put it aside decades ago for drilling. Republicans have attached the ANWR measure to budget legislation, which needs only 50 votes to pass the Senate, but faces hurdles with many provisions being added to it.     Democrats are fighting the ANWR bill saying that Republicans are trying to sneak it through the budget process, and that it would not survive as stand-alone legislation that would need 60 votes to pass. Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the energy committee, told Reuters she was urging her fellow lawmakers to listen to scientists. \u201cDoes it take the voice of Jane Goodall to beg Senators to stop hurting indigenous people and animals?\u201d asked Cantwell.\u201d  \u201cShe\u2019s calling on them to set a conservation example instead of creating the next tragedy.\u201d ",

        "title": "Trump reaches out to lawmakers on healthcare as another says 'no'",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump made calls to fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate on Friday to mobilize support for their party\u2019s healthcare overhaul while acknowledging the legislation is on a \u201cvery, very narrow path\u201d to passage. Five Republican senators have announced they will not support the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, in its current form. White House officials said on Friday that Trump has been in touch with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and made calls on Thursday and Friday to other lawmakers. Trump\u2019s role is expected to become more pronounced in coming days as the vote nears. Senate Republican leaders may rely on the deal-making former businessman to lean on conservative senators who are balking at the bill. \u201cWe\u2019re pleasantly surprised with a lot of the support that\u2019s already come out and I think we\u2019ll continue to work through (it,) in particular the four individuals who have expressed some ideas and concerns,\u201d White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at a White House briefing. With all Democrats expected to oppose the measure, the Republicans can afford to lose the support of only two of their 52 members if they want to pass the legislation. After Spicer spoke, Republican Senator Dean Heller became the fifth Republican opponent on Friday, saying he would not support the bill in its current form.  \u201cThis bill that\u2019s currently in front of the United States Senate is not the answer,\u201d Heller, a moderate who is up for re-election in 2018, said at a news conference in Las Vegas. That could add Heller\u2019s name to Trump\u2019s call list. A White House official said the Trump has pushed his team to stay involved and plans to flex his negotiating muscle, the official said. An outside political group aligned with the White House, America First Policies, said it is planning an advertising campaign targeting Heller for his opposition to the bill. Healthcare stocks closed down 0.1 percent on Friday, clawing back some losses after the sector dropped sharply late in the session on Heller\u2019s announcement. The Senate\u2019s 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by McConnell, aims to deliver on a central Trump campaign promise to undo former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. On Thursday, four of the Senate\u2019s most conservative members said the new plan failed to rein in the federal government\u2019s role. Rand Paul, who has rejected the plan along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson, said fundamental problems remained that would leave taxpayers subsidizing health insurance companies. Trump, in an interview with Fox News that aired on Friday morning, called the group of conservative lawmakers \u201cfour very good people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re opposed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d like to get certain changes. And we\u2019ll see if we can take care of that.\u201d Trump said getting approval would require traveling a \u201cvery, very narrow path\u201d but that \u201cI think we\u2019re going to get there.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a good bill,\u201d Trump said in a separate Fox News interview to air on Sunday.   For the House of Representatives\u2019 version of healthcare, Trump held regular meetings with representatives at the White House. He celebrated the bill\u2019s narrow passage last month in a Rose Garden event with House Republican leaders.  Trump later criticized the House bill privately as \u201cmean\u201d and this week called for a health plan \u201cwith heart.\u201d He indicated the Senate plan met that request. McConnell said in an interview with Reuters last month that he told Trump early on in the process that he did not need his help but that there may be a role for him later. The Senate bill maintains much of the structure of the House\u2019s but differs in key ways. It would phase out Obamacare\u2019s expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually, waiting until after the 2020 presidential election, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025. It also would provide more generous tax subsidies than the House bill to help low-income people buy private insurance. ",

        "title": "Popular Michelle Obama courts young people for Clinton",
        "text": "FAIRFAX, Va. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign deployed a popular surrogate on Friday to gin up enthusiasm amid young voters who could be critical to victory on Nov. 8: Michelle Obama. The U.S. first lady and wife of President Barack Obama, who won the White House in 2008 and 2012 with high levels of support from young voters, told a crowd of students in Virginia that they could mean the difference between a Clinton win or a loss to Republican nominee Donald Trump. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, elections aren\u2019t just about who votes, but who doesn\u2019t vote. And that is especially true for young people like all of you,\u201d she said, noting that voters under the age of 30 provided the margin of victory for Obama in the swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and Virginia in 2012. \u201cWithout those votes, Barack would have lost those states and he definitely would have lost that election. Period, end of story,\u201d she said. A New York Times/CBS poll this week showed Clinton with more support from people under 30 than Trump but still well below the levels Obama achieved.  Though she has not yet been a frequent presence on the 2016 campaign trail, Mrs. Obama has proven to be an especially powerful advocate for Clinton, her husband\u2019s one-time rival. Her speech in support of Clinton at the Democratic convention in July was praised as one of the best of that event. \u201cI\u2019m inspired,\u201d she said, listing Clinton\u2019s positions in public service and rejecting arguments that Clinton was not an inspiring figure. The current first lady praised the former first lady as one of the most qualified people for the office of president in history. \u201cSo we cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative.\u00a0Because here is what we know: that being president isn\u2019t anything like reality TV,\u201d  Mrs. Obama said, referring to Trump, a former reality television host. A president could not just \u201cpop off\u201d when making life or death decisions about war and peace, she said without naming Trump.   Mrs. Obama noted that the country was in a time of transition, just like her family, which was about to move into a new house. She joked that they had to make sure the White House was cleaned up so they could get their security deposit back. Then she referred to the transition in 2008 with a dig at Trump for questioning whether Barack Obama was born in Hawaii. On Friday he finally conceded that Obama was U.S. born. \u201cThere were those who questioned, and continued to question for the past eight years, up through this very day, whether my husband was even born in this country,\u201d she said to boos. \u201cI think Barack has answered those questions with the example he\u2019s set: by going high when they go low.\u201d\u00a0 ",

        "title": "Massachusetts ballot initiative on president tax return passes hurdle",
        "text": "BOSTON (Reuters) - A proposed Massachusetts ballot initiative that would allow voters to require U.S. presidential candidates to release their tax returns cleared a key hurdle on Wednesday, as state lawmakers mulled a similar bill after President Donald Trump declined to release his returns. The state\u2019s attorney general, Maura Healey, a Democrat, certified the initiative petition along with 20 others covering a variety of topics as having met constitutional requirements for ballot questions. The proposed Massachusetts law would require candidates for U.S. president and vice president to submit to the state\u2019s secretary copies of their federal income tax returns for the last six years that could then be made public. Certification of the petitions means backers can begin collecting the tens of thousands of signatures needed to get their questions onto the November 2018 ballot. Healey\u2019s office said her decision did not mean she supported the petitions. The election-related initiative came after Trump, a Republican, last year became the first major presidential candidate since the 1970s to not voluntarily release at least some of his tax returns. Healey\u2019s certification of the petition came as state lawmakers held a committee hearing and took testimony on a bill that would require U.S. presidential candidates to also disclose their tax returns in order to get onto the ballot. Senator Michael Barrett, the bill\u2019s Democratic sponsor, in an interview said the bill had \u201ca lot of grassroots interest,\u201d and was receiving support from March Forward Mass, which formed after the Women\u2019s March protest held in January a day after Trump was inaugurated. William Galvin, the Democratic secretary of state, testified in support of the bill, saying the public disclosure of tax returns is needed in order for voters to know about a candidate\u2019s potential conflicts of interest. \u201cThis bill is not about Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because of Donald Trump.\u201d Barrett acknowledged such a law could be subject to lawsuits. The U.S. Constitution sets out qualifications to become president, and critics could argue the state\u2019s law would unconstitutionally do the same. But Galvin testified that he believed that a law requiring tax returns\u2019 disclosures could survive a legal challenge as states have a right to set conditions to get on their ballots. Similar proposals are being considered in other states. Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in May vetoed a bill that would have required the disclosure by presidential candidates of tax returns, calling it \u201cpolitics at its worst.\u201d ",

U.S. officials have told Reuters that the United States will send about 3,500 additional troops to Afghanistan. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were battered by hurricanes Irma and Maria.

        "text": "(Reuters) - An Illinois law allowing voters in highly populated areas to register to vote at polling places on election day was reinstated on Tuesday by a federal court, pending an appeal of a ruling declaring the statute unfair to people in smaller communities. The state is seeking to overturn a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Samuel Der-Yeghiayan, which found that the law discriminates against voters in less-populated counties. The law, passed in late 2014 by the Democratic-led legislature and signed into law in early 2015 by former Democratic Governor Pat Quinn, allowed election day voter registration for the first time, including at polling places. But the section of the law regarding polling place registration pertained only to counties with populations of 100,000 or more. The conservative Liberty Justice Center, of Chicago, filed a lawsuit in August, saying the law was discriminatory. Der-Yeghiayan agreed, writing that the law provided an advantage to urban voters over their rural counterparts.  The state of Illinois appealed the ruling last month, and in their order issued Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit granted the state\u2019s request to stay the order until the appeal was adjudicated, court records show. U.S. voters will go to the polls to choose a president, Congressional representatives and other officials on Nov. 8. On Tuesday, the appellate court ordered attorneys on both sides to say by Thursday whether they would like the appeals process to be sped up due to the proximity of the election. ",

        "title": "'Congratulations': EU moves to Brexit phase two but warns will be tough",
        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union agreed on Friday to move Brexit talks onto trade and a transition pact but some leaders cautioned that the final year of divorce negotiations before Britain s exit could be fraught with peril. EU leaders, who had offered British Prime Minister Theresa May a rare summit round of applause over dinner in Brussels the night before, took just 10 minutes to agree that she had made  sufficient progress  on divorce terms last week and to give negotiators a mandate to move on to the main phase of talks.  This is an important step on the road to delivering the smooth and orderly Brexit that people voted for in June of last year,  May said outside her home in Berkshire, southern England.  There is still more to do but we re well on the road to delivering a Brexit that will make Britain prosperous, strong and secure,  May said, reassuring her party s ardent Brexit supporters that departure is certain on March 29, 2019. Summit chair Donald Tusk said the world s biggest trading bloc would start  exploratory contacts  with Britain on what London wants in a future trade relationship, as well as starting discussion on the immediate post-Brexit transition. A transition period is crucial for investors and businesses who fear that a  cliff-edge  Brexit would disrupt trade flows and sow chaos through financial markets.  The head of the EU executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, cast May as a  tough, smart, polite and friendly negotiator    a polite nod to a woman facing ferocious and complex pressures at home, whose downfall Brussels fears would complicate talks further. Juncker, a veteran premier of Luxembourg, knows  what it s like to be a prime minister in trouble , one EU official said. While there was a  sigh of relief  at the summit table that Brexit talks can move forward, EU leaders said talks on a future free trade pact will not begin until after March   a date underlined by  guidelines  that set out how to proceed as Britain seeks to unravel more than 40 years of membership. The talks will be tough.   We have made good progress, the second phase of talks can start,  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said.  But this will mean even tougher work - that was clear today in the discussion - than we have experienced so far.   Sterling GBP=D3 reversed gains and fell 0.8 percent on the day to $1.3327. Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern went further, saying even a primary school student could see that the  first phase  deal on the Irish border would come back to haunt the talks because it was impossible for Britain to leave the bloc s single market while avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  Our primary school students can see that there is a riddle to be solved,  the Austrian leader told reporters. In more formal language, leaders used the nine-point guidelines they agreed at the summit to support May s call for a two-year transition out of the bloc, which aims to help British business and citizens adjust to life after the European Union. Both sides see it as looking pretty much like membership of the EU without a say in its rules, though there are also a host of issues that will again demonstrate the complexity of Brexit. Leaders reiterated their position that Britain cannot conclude a free-trade accord with the European Union until it has left and become a  third country . And it may take longer than the 15 months from now that some in London are hoping for. Noting a call from Britain s Brexit Secretary David Davis for a  Canada plus plus plus  deal that would go beyond the pact the EU signed with Ottawa, one senior EU official noted that last year s agreement ran to 1,598 pages of legal text.  Nine months on Brexit have produced 15 pages of non-legal text,  he said, adding that even launching trade talks in March would be  quite ambitious , let alone completing them in 2019. In coded language aimed at ensuring that Britain s departure will not set a precedent for others and further undermine the bloc, leaders also agreed to  ensure a balance of rights and obligations  during Britain s transition period. The question of how Britain might continue to benefit from the EU s free trade deals with other countries, such as Canada or Japan, has yet to be settled legally, EU officials said. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar cautioned that there were  quite divergent opinions  on how a new relationship and transition would look. EU officials are unsure exactly how far Britain should continue to receive the full, unfettered economic benefits of EU membership during a transition after it leaves, even if it loses political representation in Brussels. May, weakened after losing her Conservative Party s majority in a June election, has so far carried her divided government and party with her as she negotiated the first phase of talks. But the next, more decisive phase is likely to lay bare the deep rifts among her top team of ministers over what Britain should become after Brexit. The Dutch, traditionally British allies, said May should explain to voters just what the cost of leaving the EU s single market and customs union would mean for the economy.  It means, for example, that the financial sector of London will have a considerable disadvantage to the position they have now,  Prime Minister Mark Rutte said. ",

        "title": "Venezuela doctors in protest urge stronger WHO stance on health crisis",
        "text": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela s doctors, fed up with what they called the World Health Organization s passive attitude toward the country s deep medical crisis, protested at the agency s Caracas office on Monday to demand more pressure on the government and additional assistance. Venezuela is suffering from a roughly 85 percent shortage of medicines, decrepit hospital infrastructure, and an exodus of doctors during a brutal recession. Once-controlled diseases like diphtheria and measles have returned due in part to insufficient vaccines and antibiotics, while Venezuelans suffering chronic illnesses like cancer or diabetes often have to forgo treatment. Malnutrition is also rising, doctors say. Rare government data published in May showed maternal mortality shot up 65 percent while malaria cases jumped 76 percent. The former health minister was fired shortly after the bulletin s publication, and it has not been issued since. In the latest protest by an umbrella group of health associations, dozens of doctors and activists gathered at the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the WHO s regional office, urging the agency step up pressure on Nicolas Maduro s leftist government and provide more aid during its 29th Pan American Sanitary Conference this week.  There s been a complicit attitude because they haven t denounced things,  Dr. Rafael Muci said during the rally.  This is an unlivable country, and no one is paying attention,  he said, adding he earns about $8 a month at a state hospital. In a statement on Monday, PAHO stressed its main role was to provide  technical cooperation  and highlighted recent help in providing vaccines. The Venezuelan government, which accuses activists of whipping up panic and the business elite of hiding medicines, did not respond to a request for comment. Venezuelans seeking certain drugs often have to scour pharmacies, seek foreign donations or turn to social media.  Sociologist Maria Angelica Casanova, 51, has struggled to find psychiatric medicines for a year.  Sometimes they come, sometimes they don t. It s serious,  she said, as passers-by shouted  Down with Maduro!  Measles, which were controlled after a mass immunization in the 1990s, has returned to Venezuela s jungle state of Bolivar, PAHO data show. As the crisis stokes emigration, Venezuela s health problems could be exported, doctors warned.  We don t know how many people who are emigrating could have some of these pathogens in incubation period,  said Andres Barreto, an epidemiologist who had participated in the measles vaccination drive.

        "title": "Republican Cruz crushes Trump in Wisconsin, says party will unite",
        "text": "MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Republican Ted Cruz easily won the Wisconsin presidential primary on Tuesday, dealing a blow to front-runner Donald Trump\u2019s hopes of amassing enough delegates for the party\u2019s nomination and boosting chances of a rare contested convention. Cruz\u2019s double-digit win over Trump was a breakthrough for Republican Party forces battling to block the controversial New York billionaire, and it raised the prospect of a prolonged nomination fight that could last to the July convention in Cleveland, Ohio. Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders also won in Wisconsin, gaining momentum in his fight against front-runner Hillary Clinton and trimming her commanding lead in delegates. Trump entered the night with 737 convention delegates to Cruz\u2019s 481, leaving him 500 delegates short of the 1,237 needed to become the party\u2019s nominee in the Nov. 8 election. Cruz said the result in Wisconsin showed the party was beginning to rally behind him, but he acknowledged the growing possibility that the fight could go all the way to the convention. \u201cEither before Cleveland, or at the convention in Cleveland, together we will win a majority of the delegates and together we will beat Hillary Clinton in November,\u201d Cruz told cheering supporters in Milwaukee. \u201cWe\u2019re winning because we\u2019re uniting the Republican Party.\u201d Cruz, a conservative U.S. senator from Texas, was aided in Wisconsin by Republican Governor Scott Walker, who dropped his own presidential bid in September, and by a barrage of ads from Super PACS - independent funding groups - backed by party establishment figures worried that Trump will lead Republicans to a broad defeat in November. Trump\u2019s campaign released a blistering statement saying Cruz had been propped up \u201cby countless millions of dollars of false advertising\u201d from anti-Trump Super PACs. \u201cTed Cruz is worse than a puppet -  he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump,\u201d the Trump campaign statement said. The Wisconsin primary capped a difficult week for Trump, who was forced to backtrack after saying women who have abortions should face punishment if the procedure is outlawed, and who voiced support for his campaign manager after he was charged with misdemeanor assault for grabbing a reporter. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll on Tuesday showed Cruz about even with Trump nationally, with Cruz\u2019s recent gains the first time since November that a Trump rival has threatened his standing at the head of the Republican pack. The poll of 568 Republicans, taken between April 1-5, showed Cruz winning the support of 35 percent of Republicans to Trump\u2019s 39 percent. Cruz and Trump were also briefly about even early last week. In the Democratic race, the win for Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, is his sixth in the last seven contests for the nomination. Sanders said his message of breaking up big banks, reining in Wall Street and reducing income inequality was bringing new and young voters into the process. \u201cWhat we have been seeing throughout this campaign is extraordinary voter turnout in state after state,\u201d Sanders said at a rally in Laramie, Wyoming. Clinton, who did not appear in public on Tuesday night, tweeted her congratulations to Sanders. \u201cCongrats to @BernieSanders on winning Wisconsin,\u201d Clinton said on Twitter. \u201cTo all the voters and volunteers who poured your hearts into this campaign: Forward! -H.\u201d Sanders still faces a difficult task overtaking Clinton as the race moves to New York on April 19 and to five other Eastern states on April 26. Heading into Tuesday, Clinton led Sanders by 263 pledged delegates in the race for the 2,383 needed to be nominated at the party\u2019s July convention in Philadelphia. She also has a big lead in superdelegates, who are party leaders free to back any candidate. Sanders needs to win up to two-thirds of the remaining delegates to catch Clinton, who will keep accumulating delegates even when she loses under a Democratic Party system that awards them proportionally in all states. Sanders needs to rack up big winning margins over Clinton in the remaining states to close the gap. He has vowed to stay in the race until the convention, and his campaign says superdelegates could begin to shift their support to him if they see he has popular support. ",

        "text": "BOGOTA (Reuters) - Thirteen people, including civilians, were killed during a confrontation between Colombia s ELN rebels and dissidents from the now-demobilized FARC guerrilla group in a remote area known for drug trafficking, the country s ombudsman said on Tuesday. The incident took place on Nov. 27 in the southwestern Narino region, a place where crime gangs and rebel groups are known to grow, process and smuggle coca, the base ingredient in cocaine. A hard-won peace accord was agreed with the now-disbanded Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group last year, ending some five decades of war.  But an array of FARC dissidents, National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels, right-wing ex-paramilitaries and crime gangs are still active in Colombia, competing for control of lucrative illegal mines and drug trafficking routes.  In Narino, fighters from the ELN attacked members of the Rural Resistance, ombudsmen Carlos Alfonso Negret said in a report. The Rural Resistance are FARC dissidents who refused to demobilize following the peace deal.  The ombudsman s office visited the area and was able to determine that there was an exchange of fire between the group that calls itself Rural Resistance and the ELN,  Negret told journalists.  There was crossfire that killed 13 people.  Neither the report nor Negret specified how many of the dead were civilians. More than 11,000 fighters and collaborators from the FARC handed over their weapons this year as part of the peace accord. The group has kept its initials in its reincarnation as a political party. But Negret says some 800 former guerrillas did not demobilize, while other security sources and thinktanks put the number of dissident ex-FARC at between 700 and 1,300. The ELN and the government began their first ever bilateral ceasefire in October, part of peace talks taking place in Ecuador. The ceasefire is set to run through Jan. 9 and may be extended. The incident was a violation of the ceasefire, Negret said. It is the second act of violence which has overshadowed the ceasefire, after the ELN admitted to killing an indigenous leader in restive Choco province. ",

        "text": "TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Over two dozen people were injured in clashes on Friday between Honduran security forces and protesters demanding a vote recount for last month s contentious and still unresolved presidential election, according to the Red Cross.  Supporters of the center-left Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship, led by TV star Salvador Nasralla, set fire to tires across the country, blocking major thoroughfares in the capital, Tegucigalpa, and the second city of San Pedro Sula.  Police and soldiers responded with tear gas to rock-throwing protesters who set fire to a vehicle for carrying soldiers in Tegucigalpa. Near San Pedro Sula, protesters blocked a road leading to the key Puerto Cortes port, before being moved on by security forces. The Honduran branch of the International Committee of the Red Cross said that 27 people had been injured in the clashes. At least five of those injured in the northern city of Villanueva, near San Pedro Sula, had been shot, it said. Honduras has been roiled by political instability in the wake of the Nov. 26 vote, which remains unresolved. Nasralla trails conservative President Juan Orlando Hernandez by 1.6 percentage points according to the official count, which has been questioned by the two main opposition parties and a wide swathe of the diplomatic corps. Honduras  electoral tribunal said on Sunday that a partial recount of votes showed broadly the same result as previously, maintaining Hernandez s lead. It has until Dec. 26 to declare a winner. Last week, Honduras  two main opposition parties presented formal requests to annul the results of the election. ",

        "title": "Highlights: The Trump presidency on March 24 at 5:31 p.m. EDT",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration on Friday: Trump suffers a stunning political setback in a Congress controlled by his own party when Republican leaders pull legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system, a major 2016 election campaign promise of the president and his allies. Trump says the healthcare legislation he supported had been \u201cvery, very close\u201d to getting enough support in the House of Representatives and that now he probably will move on to tax reform. Wall Street\u2019s predilection for a glass-half-full view of Trump is on full display as investors back off fears that a failure to repeal Obamacare would endanger his entire agenda in favor of optimism that he will simply get on with tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Nearly half of American adults say the Republican healthcare reform measure that was pulled from consideration by the House is \u201cnot an improvement\u201d over Obamacare, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The partisan divide over the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election deepens when the committee\u2019s top Democrat suggested its Republican chairman canceled a public hearing after pressure from the White House. A third of Democratic senators have so far announced they will vote against confirming Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, adding to a chorus of opposition from the left, but leaving questions over whether there will be a concerted effort to block a vote in the Senate. Trump\u2019s administration approves TransCanada Corp\u2019s Keystone XL pipeline, cheering the oil industry and angering environmentalists even as further hurdles for the controversial project loom. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says financial markets could improve \u201csignificantly\u201d once they fully reflect the potential for economic growth from Trump\u2019s policies. A federal judge in Virginia rules that Trump\u2019s travel ban was justified, increasing the likelihood the measure will go before the Supreme Court as the decision takes an opposing view to courts in Maryland and Hawaii that have halted the order.  California approves vehicle pollution targets that the Trump administration last week put on hold, setting up a potential face-off between federal and state regulators that could be expensive for automakers and a headache for consumers. Trump touts Charter Communications Inc\u2019s decision to invest $25 billion in the United States and its previously disclosed plan to hire 20,000 workers over four years. ",

        "title": "Obama faces immigration hurdles even if he wins at high court",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If the U.S. Supreme Court endorses a key immigration initiative of President Barack Obama protecting more than 4 million illegal immigrants from deportation, his administration could face a surge of applicants and little time to process them before he leaves office in January 2017. Obama announced the action in November 2014 but it has never gone into effect, being put on hold by a federal judge in Texas in February 2015. The plan was designed to help illegal immigrant parents of children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. It would protect them from deportation and give them work authorization. The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would decide whether Obama acted lawfully in creating the program by executive order, bypassing a gridlocked Congress. If Obama wins when the court rules by the end of June, his administration would have just seven months to implement the program. Obama\u2019s victory could be short-lived because the next president, set to be elected in November, would have the final say on whether to keep the program in place. Democrats including presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton have embraced Obama\u2019s plan. Republican presidential candidates including businessman Donald Trump and Texas Senator Ted Cruz have assailed it. Cruz said on Tuesday if elected he would rescind Obama\u2019s order on the first day of his presidency. An earlier immigration program that gave similar relief to children of illegal immigrants who grew up in the United States showed that such policies take time to implement. Launched in June 2012, it took two months to put in place.  After that, there were almost 408,000 applications in the first six months of the program, according to government numbers. By January 2013, only 154,000 applications had been approved. More than 700,000 people have since benefited from the program. The government has been able to do nothing to prepare while Obama\u2019s executive action has been on hold. In the injunction that halted the plan, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen specifically said the administration was barred from \u201cimplementing any and all aspects or phases\u201d of the program. A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said the federal government is complying with the injunction. Immigration advocates said they are preparing for a new effort to educate potential applicants about the program. They forecast much higher numbers than those who applied to the earlier 2012 program, largely because many more are eligible. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere is no way the administration can process the projected volume of people that would be eligible,\u201d said Gregory Chen, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. The new program is likely to present additional bureaucratic problems, legal experts say, in part due to the larger pool of eligible people but also because of the specific nature of the applicants. Both programs require proof of continued residency in the United States.   For younger people, this is easier to prove as usually they can cite school records, immigration experts say. For older people, who often do not speak English, it can be harder to provide necessary documentation. Women who do not work could find it especially difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a little bit more tricky for some applicants,\u201d said Adonia Simpson, managing attorney for the Esperanza Center, an immigrant resource center run by Catholic Charities in Baltimore. In some cases, approval will be delayed while the government asks for additional evidence, she added. Criticism of Obama\u2019s actions by Republican candidates could also deter some people from applying, Simpson said. In her group\u2019s discussions with immigrants, \u201cwe make it very clear that this is an executive action that could be changed,\u201d she said. ",

        "title": "Trump's EPA to reconsider oil and gas emissions rule",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will reconsider a rule on greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas operations and delay its compliance date, the agency said on Wednesday in the Trump administration\u2019s latest move to reduce regulations. Oil interest groups, including the American Petroleum Institute and the Texas Oil and Gas Association, had petitioned the EPA a year ago to reconsider the rule limiting emissions of   methane and other pollutants from new and revamped oil and gas wells and systems.  The EPA said in a statement that it would delay the rule\u2019s June 3 compliance date by 90 days and take public comments during that period. Under Democratic President Barack Obama, the EPA released the first methane limits on the facilities in May 2016, saying it would cost energy companies $530 million, but would lead to $690 million in benefits, including lowering medical bills.  Scott Pruitt, the EPA chief in the administration of Republican President Donald Trump, joined dozens of other states  in challenging the rule when he was attorney general of oil-producing Oklahoma. Pruitt has said he does not believe that greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of climate change.  Energy companies had complained that the methane rule would add costs to wells that were not producing much oil and gas, and that it was duplicative as the sector had already reduced the emissions. Environmentalists believe limiting methane, a gas about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat, is a low-hanging fruit in efforts to curb climate change.  Michelle Robinson, director of the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said EPA was favoring industry over science. \u201cInstead of looking backwards to review well-reasoned rules based on clear science, the administration should be moving forward,\u201d and extend methane limits, she said.  Wednesday\u2019s move signaled another retreat from climate change action after the Trump administration in March halted an effort to gather methane data from existing oil and gas operations to rein in leaks of the powerful greenhouse gas. In late March, Trump signed an order to undo climate regulations, following up on a campaign promise.  Pruitt said the EPA is continuing to follow through with Trump\u2019s order. \u201cAmerican businesses should have the opportunity to review new requirements, assess economic impacts and report back, before those new requirements are finalized,\u201d he said.

        "text": "HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba s foreign minister and his North Korean counterpart rejected the United States   unilateral and arbitrary  demands on Wednesday while expressing concern about escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula, the ministry said. North Korea is searching for support amid unprecedented pressure from the United States and the international community to cease its nuclear weapons and missile programs, which it carries out in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. The country, which has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, has maintained warm political relations with Cuba since 1960, despite the island s opposition to nuclear weapons. Some diplomats said Cuba was also one of the few countries that might be able to convince North Korea to move away from the current showdown with the United States that threatens war. The ministers, meeting in Havana, called for  respect for peoples  sovereignty  and  the peaceful settlement of disputes,  according to a statement released by the Cuban foreign ministry.  They strongly rejected the unilateral and arbitrary lists and designations established by the U.S. government which serve as a basis for the implementation of coercive measures which are contrary to international law,  the statement said. U.S. President Donald Trump has also increased pressure on Cuba since taking office, rolling back a fragile detente begun by predecessor Barack Obama and returning to the hostile rhetoric of the Cold War. A U.S. State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the United States had made clear it wanted a peaceful resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue.  The DPRK s belligerent and provocative behavior demonstrates it has no interest in working toward a peaceful solution,  the official said. DPRK stands for North Korea s official name, the Democratic People s Republic of Korea. Cuba said in the statement the Cuban and North Korean foreign ministers had  expressed concern about the escalation of tensions  on the Korean peninsula.  The ministers discussed the respective efforts carried out in the construction of socialism according to the realities inherent to their respective countries.  Cuba and North Korea are the last in the world to maintain Soviet-style command economies, though under President Raul Castro, the Caribbean nation has taken some small steps toward the more market-oriented communism of China and Vietnam. Cuba maintains an embassy in North Korea, but publicly trades almost exclusively with the South. Last year, trade with the latter was $67 million and with the North just $9 million, according to the Cuban government. North Korea defends its weapons programs as a necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intentions. ",

Senator Thad Cochran is the only Republican among five U.S. senators and a U.S. representative on a three-day visit to the Communist-run Caribbean island to discuss relations and explore business opportunities. The agreements were signed during a business forum to explore future trade attended by Cochran. \u201cThere is great potential for business between these ports and Cuba due to the geographical proximity and the excellent fluvial and maritime ways Mississippi has,\u201d state-run media quoted Maria de la Luz B\u2019Hamel, director of commercial policy with the United States at the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Trade and Investment, as saying. The event was closed to foreign journalists.

Lieutenant General Karl Muellner s comments are his clearest public statements to date on the Tornado replacement program. They indicate a preference for Lockheed Martin Corp s F-35 fighter jet, the only Western aircraft that meets those requirements. The air force last month issued a formal request for information about the F-35, as well as three other jets: the F-15 and F/A-18E/F, both built by Boeing Co, and the European Eurofighter Typhoon. Germany is kicking off the process of replacing its 85 Tornado jets, which will go out of service around 2030. The program could be worth billions of euros for the winning bidder in coming years.  Muellner told Reuters Germany would need to buy an off-the-shelf replacement that could enter service around 2025 to facilitate a smooth transition with the Tornado, noting that did not leave enough time to develop a unique solution. But he said changing warfare requirements and the need for a credible deterrent meant the successor fighter had to be  low-observable, and able to identify and strike targets from a great distance .   It will have to be a fifth-generation jet to meet the full spectrum of our needs,  Muellner said. Many German allies in Europe, including Norway, the Netherlands, Britain, Italy, Turkey and Denmark have selected the F-35 and some have received initial deliveries. Belgium is expected to make a decision next year. Lockheed is rolling out the red carpet, bringing its F-35 flight simulator to Berlin and offering members of parliament, ministry and military officials and a journalists a chance to  fly  the stealthy single-seat, single-engine fighter. It even printed a new version of its standard F-35 lapel pin in the black, red and gold colors of Germany s flag. Any new fighter jet purchase would have to be approved by parliament in the next two years and a contract signed by 2020 or 2021 to ensure deliveries by 2025. A purchase of around 100 jets would help ensure German industry got a decent share of work on the program. Steve Over, Lockheed s director of F-35 international business development, welcomed the comments and said Lockheed stood ready to support the German government in its selection process. He said most F-35 foreign military sales involved some work for companies in the buying country. Over told Reuters the price of the aircraft would have dropped to around $80 million by the time Germany would need to sign a contract. He said interest was growing in the F-35 given the changing threat environment.  It s really about giving nations a deterrent capability. Because if you re got the capability to take an airplane into another country s airspace and they don t even know you re there, that s an incredible deterrent,  he said. Muellner said he also strongly supported a Franco-German plan to develop a successor for its fleet of what will be 140  Eurofighter Typhoon jets, built by Britain s BAE Systems Plc, Italy s Leonardo and Airbus. The project, unveiled in July, would help preserve critical technology skills in Europe and allow Europe to develop its own low-observable technology, Muellner said. Airbus last week said that choosing an interim U.S. fighter that could eventually become a longer term commitment might interfere with the Franco-German fighter. Industry sources said a decision to order the F-35 would be negative for Airbus, which is part of the Eurofighter consortium and is seen as one of the key partners in the Franco-German initiative announced earlier this year. Muellner said the German air force had also committed to NATO to provide a fleet of 14 electronic warfare aircraft by the middle of the next decade, which meant it would likely have to buy around 20 such jets. Possible candidates could be the Boeing EA-18 Growler, a modified A400M transport plane that could provide stand-off jamming capability, or a modified Eurofighter, experts said. No decisions on that program have been made. ",

        "title": "U.S. to unveil streamlined autonomous vehicle guidelines Tuesday",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao will unveil on Tuesday streamlined safety guidelines for automakers that want to deploy self-driving vehicles, a person briefed on the matter said Monday, as members of Congress push their own proposals to remove regulatory barriers to the technology. The new Transportation Department policy is expected to offer the lighter regulatory touch that automakers have pushed for. For example, the Transportation Department is expected to state that automakers do not have to seek approval from regulators before putting self-driving vehicles on the road.  Separately, the National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday is expected to release findings that Tesla Inc\u2019s semi-autonomous Autopilot mode was a contributing factor in the May 2016 death of a motorist. That case has highlighted concerns about the design of systems that automate some, but not all, driving tasks. The new document is titled \u201cA Vision for Safety\u201d and will be less than half the length of the Obama administration guidelines released in September 2016 and will be less \u201cburdensome,\u201d the  person briefed on the announcement said. Chao is expected to make the announcement in Ann Arbor at a self-driving testing facility.  The Transportation Department is releasing its voluntary safety standards at the same time a bipartisan coalition in Congress is moving forward on legislation also designed to speed commercialization of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking their deployment.   On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted unanimously on a measure to clear legal obstacles that could discourage automakers and technology companies from putting self-driving cars into broader use. The House measure would allow automakers to field up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year. Over three years, the cap would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually. Automakers would be required to provide regulators with safety assessments of their systems, but would not have to get federal approval to put autonomous cars on the road. A group of senators introduced a similar draft bill on Friday. In September 2016, the Obama administration proposed that automakers voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems in a 15-point \u201csafety assessment\u201d and urged states to defer to the federal government on most vehicle regulations. An auto trade group representing General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp and others, objected to the Obama administration proposal. ",

        "text": "PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Chelsea Clinton took the stage of the Democratic National Convention on Thursday to portray her mother Hillary Clinton as a loving, smart and playful woman qualified to be elected president of the United States.   In a 12-minute introduction received warmly in a packed Philadelphia arena, Chelsea Clinton countered criticism that her mother is an untrustworthy politician who struggles to show compassion in front of American voters. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman driven by compassion, by faith, by a fierce sense of justice and a heart full of love,\u201d the only child of presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton and former U.S. President Bill Clinton told the crowd. Hillary Clinton took the stage minutes later to become the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major U.S. party.  Chelsea Clinton, a 36-year-old mother of two, was the last in a series of speakers at the four-day gathering who sought to cast Hillary Clinton in a familial light ahead of the Nov. 8 election against Republican Donald Trump. She called her mother a \u201cwonderful, thoughtful, hilarious\u201d person who made time during her childhood to attend dance and piano recitals, and to gaze at the sky with her to find \u201cshapes in the clouds\u201d. \u201cThat feeling of being valued and loved, that\u2019s what my mom wants for every child. It is the calling of her life,\u201d Chelsea Clinton said. President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden had also given speeches supporting Clinton, casting her as qualified for the Oval Office because of her experience as a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, but also because of her loyalty and passion. Chelsea Clinton, who has been in the public eye since her childhood in the White House, took a low profile after her father left office in 2001. She married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky and served as vice chair of the Clinton Foundation charity. After her mother\u2019s presidential bid she re-entered public life to hit the campaign trail, endearing herself to supporters with stories of Clinton as a mother and grandmother to her children, Charlotte, aged 2 come September, and Aidan, born in June. Trump has also relied on his children to soften his image. His eldest daughter Ivanka spoke at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last week, depicting the New York businessman as \u201ccolor-blind and gender-neutral\u201d to counter critics who have called his comments about immigrants and women bigoted and callous. Both candidates\u2019 children say they are friends, a relationship they struck up before their parents launched campaigns for the White House. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An extra 2,500 visas for Afghans who assisted American forces during the war in their country will be granted under the $1 trillion U.S. government funding deal reached on Sunday, preserving a program that had been at risk of shutting down. The spending deal agreed by congressional negotiators  continued the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program, which allows Afghans who worked for the U.S. government, often risking their lives, to move to the United States after a rigorous vetting process. A recent bi-partisan push by U.S. lawmakers for more SIV visas came against the backdrop of efforts by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to clamp down on immigration from majority Muslim countries, an effort that has been blocked by the courts. In March, the U.S. embassy in Kabul said it had stopped scheduling interviews for SIV applicants because it had nearly run out of visas, even though 1,500 more were included in the National Defense Authorization Act passed in late 2016. That helped prompt a group of senators, including Republican Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain to seek more.  As of April 20, only 780 SIV visas remained available, while more than 14,000 Afghans had already begun the application progress, according to the U.S. State Department. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a long-time advocate for the SIV program, said letting it lapse would have sent a message that the United States was willing to abandon its supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s both a moral and practical imperative that Congress approve additional visas. Thousands of Afghans have put themselves, and their families, at risk to help our soldiers and diplomats accomplish the U.S. mission and return home safely,\u201d Shaheen said in an emailed statement.  Afghanistan is not one of the six countries whose citizens would have been barred under Trump\u2019s executive order, but some of the president\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress have resisted expanding the SIV program out of concern that militants could use it to enter the United States. Supporters of the program say such concerns are overblown, noting the intensity of the screening to which applicants are subjected. ",

        "title": "Alaska governor urges budget compromise to avoid state shutdown",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Alaska Governor Bill Walker urged state legislatures on Tuesday to compromise on a budget in order to avoid an unprecedented government shutdown next month. The state has a multibillion dollar deficit that must be sorted before July 1, the start of Alaska\u2019 new fiscal year, in order to avoid shuttering government offices and services. Last week, Alaska warned thousands of state workers about potential layoffs unless legislators can agree on a fix to the fiscal crisis. The legislature has been convening through a special session, but Walker described the negotiations as in \u201ca stalemate.\u201d On Monday, Walker proposed a compromise package that would reduce the state\u2019s deficit from at least $3.7 billion last year to a $300 million shortfall. \u201cI\u2019m not wild about the compromise,\u201d said Walker, an independent, during a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cBut we\u2019re running out of time.\u201d Pete Kelly, a Republican representing Fairbanks and the Republican-led Senate president, told reporters on Tuesday evening that the governor\u2019s message was \u201cwell received but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll agree to everything.\u201d The Senate was evaluating the package, but a reduced budget was \u201cstill the priority,\u201d Kelly said.  Leaders of the Democratic-controlled House declined to comment. Since 2013, Alaska has struggled with substantial consecutive budget deficits, in part caused by the state\u2019s large reliance on oil revenues and the continued low prices of oil. The state has balanced its budget over the last few years by drawing $10 billion from its savings without adding new revenues. The state\u2019s budget has been slashed from $7.8 billion in 2013 to $4.3 billion proposed for 2018.  \u201cI know some people say, \u2018We need to do some cuts.\u2019 We\u2019ve been doing that,\u201d Walker said on Tuesday. \u201cWe have done that significantly.\u201d Almost 2,300 state positions were eliminated in recent years, along with 70 state programs, and over 40 state facilities, such as prisons, youth detention, and motor vehicle sites, have been closed, Walker said.

        "title": "Obama seeks funds to fight Zika; sees no cause for panic",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will ask the U.S. Congress for more than $1.8 billion in emergency funds to fight Zika at home and abroad and pursue a vaccine, the White House said on Monday, but he added there is no reason to panic over the mosquito-borne virus. Zika, spreading rapidly in South and Central America and the Caribbean, has been linked to severe birth defects in Brazil, and public health officials\u2019 concern is focused on pregnant women and women who may become pregnant. Obama\u2019s request to Congress includes $200 million for research, development and commercialization of new vaccines and diagnostic tests for the virus. At least 12 groups are working to develop a vaccine. On Monday, the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMA), Europe\u2019s drugs regulator, said it established an expert task force to advise companies working on Zika vaccines and medicines, mirroring similar action during the two-year-long  Ebola epidemic that started in December 2013 and the pandemic flu outbreak in 2009. There are no vaccines or treatment for Zika and none even undergoing clinical studies. Most infected people either have no symptoms or develop mild ones like fever and skin rashes. \u201cThe good news is this is not like Ebola; people don\u2019t die of Zika. A lot of people get it and don\u2019t even know that they have it,\u201d Obama told CBS News in an interview aired on Monday. \u201cBut there shouldn\u2019t be panic on this. This is not something where people are going to die from it. It is something we have to take seriously.\u201d Most of the money sought by Obama, who faces pressure from Republicans and some fellow Democrats to act decisively on Zika, would be spent in the United States on testing, surveillance and response in affected areas, including the creation of rapid-response teams to contain outbreak clusters. At a White House briefing, Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said she was not expecting \u201clarge-scale amounts of serious Zika infections\u201d in the continental United States as warmer months bring larger and more active mosquito populations. \u201cWe do think it\u2019s likely that we will have limited local transmission in some of the southern states,\u201d Schuchat said. Obama\u2019s funding request to Congress includes $335 million for the U.S. Agency for International Development to support mosquito-control, maternal health and other Zika-related public health efforts in affected countries in the Americas. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the White House briefing a vaccine likely would not be widely available \u201cfor a few years.\u201d Fauci said he anticipated beginning a so-called Phase 1 trial this summer for a Zika vaccine that would take about three months to test if it is safe and induces a good immune response before further studies can be conducted. The CDC said its Zika emergency operations center, with a staff of 300, has been placed on its highest level of activation, reflecting a need for accelerated preparedness for possible local virus transmission by mosquitoes in the continental United States. Some lawmakers have urged Obama to name a Zika \u201cczar\u201d to head U.S. efforts against the virus, but Fauci said he sees no need right now for such an appointment. Much remains unknown about Zika, including whether the virus actually causes microcephaly, a condition marked by abnormally small head size that can result in developmental problems. Brazil is investigating the potential link between Zika infections and more than 4,000 suspected cases of microcephaly.  Researchers have identified evidence of Zika infection in 17 of these cases, either in the baby or in the mother, but have not confirmed that Zika can cause microcephaly.\u00a0 Word that Zika can be spread by sexual transmission and blood transfusions and its discovery in saliva and urine of infected people have added to concern over the virus.  The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international health emergency on Feb. 1, citing a \u201cstrongly suspected\u201d relationship between Zika infection in pregnancy to microcephaly. Brazil is grappling with the virus even as it prepares to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in August, with tens of thousands of athletes and tourists anticipated. The U.S. Olympic Committee has told U.S. sports federations that athletes and staff concerned about their health due to Zika should consider not going to the Olympics. The message was delivered in a conference call involving USOC officials and leaders of U.S. sports federations in late January. Former Olympian Donald Anthony, president and board chairman of USA Fencing, said, \u201cOne of the things that they immediately said was, especially for women that may be pregnant or even thinking of getting pregnant, that whether you are scheduled to go to Rio or no, that you shouldn\u2019t go.\u201d At the White House, Fauci said athletes would need to make a personal decision about whether or not to skip the Olympics.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Britain s top internal security official is pressing social media companies to devise automatic systems to spot and block violent militant messaging before it is posted on their networks. Amber Rudd, home secretary in the conservative British government led by Prime Minister Theresa May, told an audience at New America, a Washington think tank, on Thursday night that there was an  online arms race  between militants and the forces of law and order. Rudd said government authorities and companies were already working to ensure that militant messaging promoting violence should be removed from the internet within one or two hours of initial posting. But she said companies should press ahead with development and deployment of artificial intelligence systems that could spot such content before it is posted on the internet and block it from being disseminated. Since the beginning of 2017, violent militant operatives have created 40,000 new internet destinations, Rudd said. She noted that she visited Silicon Valley companies, including Alphabet Inc s Google and YouTube, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc, earlier this year and called on them to do more to take down or block militant content.  As of 12 months ago, social media companies were taking down about half of the violent militant material from their sites within two hours of its discovery, and lately that proportion has increased to two thirds, she said.  YouTube is now taking down 83 percent of violent militant videos it discovers, Rudd said, adding that UK authorities have  evidence  that the Islamic State militant group was now  struggling  to get some of its materials online. But she said there was  much more  companies can do to use cutting edge technology to spot dangerous content more quickly.  She added that in the wake of an increasing number of vehicle attacks by militants, such as the one at London s Borough Market earlier this year, British security authorities were reviewing rental car regulations and considering ways for authorities to collect more relevant data from car hire companies.

        "title": "Trump's limited appeal a warning sign for Republicans ahead of 2018 elections",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic election victories in Virginia and New Jersey showed Republicans losing more ground in suburban areas, where President Donald Trump\u2019s unpopularity could cost them dearly in next year\u2019s congressional races.  The results from Tuesday, particularly in Virginia, suggest that Trump\u2019s strategy of playing to a loyal but limited base has not enabled him to broaden support for his presidency or his party. Democrats were delighted, believing that control of the U.S. House of Representatives, and perhaps even the Senate, now both controlled by Republicans, might be up for grabs in next year\u2019s elections. Some Republicans shared that view after their party\u2019s candidates did poorly among independent, college-educated, women, and minority voters in suburban areas. \u201cUnless we get our act together, we are going to lose heavily,\u201d Republican Senator John McCain said on Wednesday.  Democrats would need to pick up 24 seats next year to retake control of the House. Should that happen, Trump\u2019s policy agenda would be effectively dead and the administration would come under greater scrutiny.  The win by Democrat Phil Murphy in New Jersey\u2019s governor\u2019s race came as no surprise because of the unpopularity of outgoing Republican Governor Chris Christie. But Ralph Northam\u2019s 9-point victory over Republican Ed Gillespie for governor in swing-state Virginia was larger than expected. Trump quickly tried to distance himself from Gillespie\u2019s poor showing, saying on Twitter that the Republican candidate \u201cworked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for.\u201d Still, Trump\u2019s leadership record appeared to motivate Democrats to vote in record numbers in Virginia, with exit polls showing that many came out simply to express their displeasure with the president.  \u201cTrump is turning off more voters than he\u2019s bringing in,\u201d said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist in Washington. \u201cHis base is strong, but it isn\u2019t growing.\u201d During his first year in office, Trump has consistently played to a base of passionate supporters, many of them older white men who live in rural areas declining in population, and has shown little inclination to reach out to the majority of voters who disapprove of him.  Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Virginia, said the party was on a risky track. \u201cRepublicans have traded fast-growing upscale suburban counties for slow-growing or declining rural areas. That is not a formula for long-term success.\u201d There also may be signs of slippage in Trump\u2019s political  base.  In Virginia, Gillespie campaigned hard on immigration and crime - two hot issues with the president\u2019s supporters - but did worse than expected in some rural and suburban areas that Trump easily won last year. In rural Dickenson County, considered to be the heart of Trump country in Virginia, Gillespie\u2019s margin over Northam was almost 7 percentage points less than Trump\u2019s margin of victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton last year.  Trump won the city of Virginia Beach in 2016 by 3 points, but Gillespie lost to Northam there by 5, a swing of eight points. More critically, Gillespie was blown out by Northam in northern Virginia\u2019s populous suburbs, where Trump also struggled in the presidential race. \u201cThe suburbs came out in full force,\u201d said Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist. \u201cThey appear to be very motivated to try and deliver a message to Trump.\u201d In growing Loudoun County, outside of Washington, Democrat Barack Obama barely edged out Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race. On Tuesday, Northam buried Gillespie there by almost 20 points. \u201cI\u2019m worried,\u201d Ari Fleischer, a former White House spokesman for Republican President George W. Bush, told Fox News on Wednesday. \u201cDemocrats came out in huge numbers yesterday in the races and if they have that kind of enthusiasm going into 2018, it\u2019s going to be very tough sailing for Republicans.\u201d Gillespie, a longtime Washington insider and lobbyist, tried to keep his distance from Trump personally even as he adopted some of his more combative campaign rhetoric. It was a strategy that failed and Mackowiak said the result reflected Trump\u2019s historically low approval rating. \u201cI don\u2019t think the White House was worried about that before, but now I think they have to be.\u201d The five-day Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll has Trump hovering around 35 percent approval nationally, with close to 60 percent of respondents disapproving of his performance in office. A person familiar with Trump\u2019s political operation dismissed the election results on Tuesday as having anything to do with the president, noting that both New Jersey and Virginia were won by Clinton in 2016. Andrew Surabian, an adviser to the pro-Trump political group Great America Alliance, said Gillespie lost because he was exactly the kind of establishment Republican that Trump voters have rejected. \u201cEd Gillespie\u2019s campaign went down in flames because he failed to fully embrace the president or his agenda,\u201d Surabian said, \u201cand without a coherent message and an authentic messenger, Republican candidates will not be successful moving forward.\u201d ",

        "title": "Hurricane Irma threatens power losses for millions in Florida",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma poses a bigger menace to power supplies in Florida than Hurricane Harvey did in Texas because Irma is packing near 200 mile-per-hour winds (320 km/h) that could down power lines, close nuclear plants and threats to leave millions of homes and businesses in the dark for weeks. Irma s winds rival the strongest for any hurricane in history in the Atlantic, whereas Harvey s damage came from record rainfall. Even as Houston flooded, the power stayed on for most, allowing citizens to use TV and radio to stay apprised of danger, or social media to call for help.  When Harvey made landfall in Texas it made it fully inland and weakened pretty quickly. Irma, however, could retain much of its strength,  said Jason Setree, a meteorologist at Commodity Weather Group. Irma has killed several people and devastated islands in the Caribbean.  Current forecasts put almost the entirety of the Florida peninsula in the path of the storm, which made landfall in the Caribbean with wind speeds of 185 mph (295 km/h). The threat of the Category 5 storm, at the top of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, is grave enough that electricity generator Florida Power & Light (FPL) plans to shut its two nuclear power plants in the state, and officials warned that it may have to rebuild parts of its power system, which could take weeks.  Most Florida residents have not experienced a major storm since 2005, when total outages peaked around 3.6 million during Hurricane Wilma. Some of those outages lasted for weeks. Setree compared the projected path of Irma to Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which knocked out power to about 1.2 million FPL customers in October. FPL, a unit of Florida energy company NextEra Energy Inc, restored service to most customers affected by Matthew in just two days. But FPL spokesman Chris McGrath said:  With a storm as powerful as Irma, we want customers to prepare for damage to our infrastructure and potentially prolonged power outages.  He said it was too soon to speculate on the number and location of customers Irma could affect.  In a statement this week, FPL estimated about half of its near five million customers - particularly in the trio of populous southeast counties Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Broward - had not experienced a major hurricane since 2005.  Should Irma s worst fears be realized, our crews will likely have to completely rebuild parts of our electric system. Restoring power through repairs is measured in days; rebuilding our electric system could be measured in weeks,  FPL Chief Executive Eric Silagy said. FPL, Florida s biggest power provider, said it had invested nearly $3 billion since 2006 to strengthen its grid, including placing 60 main power lines underground and installing nearly five million smart meters and other devices. Other publicly traded utilities in the Sunshine State, including units of Duke Energy Corp, Southern Co and Emera Inc, said in statements that they had also invested in intelligent, self-healing devices. Smart meters allow utilities to see outages as they occur, rather than waiting on customer calls, and utilities also use automated devices that can reenergize lines without damage that were taken offline because of contact with trees or other objects, said Jay Apt, director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center in Pittsburgh. Olivia Ross, a spokeswoman for CenterPoint Energy, which serves the greater Houston area, said these devices helped the utility keep the lights on for more people in the aftermath of Harvey as some issues were resolved remotely. But such devices can only do so much. Harvey s outages were limited to 312,000 customers, of which CenterPoint was responsible for about 109,000, as it quickly lost force after landfall and turned into a tropical storm. By contrast, Ross noted, Hurricane Ike in 2008 caused 2.1 million of CenterPoint s customers to lose power when it hit the Texas coast near Houston. ",

        "title": "Holocaust must be bigger part of migrant courses: German minister",
        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - More emphasis should be placed on the Holocaust in integration courses for migrants, Germany s justice minister said, reflecting heightened unease among leading politicians about a spate of anti-Semitic acts including Israeli flag burnings. More than a million migrants have arrived in Germany in the last three years, many of them fleeing conflict in the Middle East, causing concern that anti-Semitism could increase. German police have reported protesters setting Israeli flags ablaze and using anti-Semitic slogans in Berlin and other cities in demonstrations against U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. In a piece for weekly magazine Der Spiegel, Justice Minister Heiko Maas wrote that the Holocaust, in which the Nazis killed six million Jews, and its significance needed to become an even more important part of integration courses and migrants should be tested on it in the examination at the end of their course.  The lessons from the Holocaust need to be one of the guiding ideas in those lessons and not just some chapter of German history,  he said.  Racism has no place in Germany, so everyone who wants to stay in Germany for the long term needs to be clear that we fight the Neonazis  anti-Semitism and we won t tolerate any imported anti-Semitism from immigrants either,  Maas added. Jens Spahn, a senior member of Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU), told Der Spiegel he thought immigration from Muslim countries was one of the causes of recent anti-Semitic demonstrations in Berlin. Spahn said incidents in recent days  were related to immigration from a culture in which people are not prissy about how they deal with Jews and homosexuals . Speaking at an event marking the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Israel, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said on Friday Germany needed to remember its historical responsibility, including the lessons of two world wars, the Holocaust, ensuring Israel s security and rejecting any form of racism and anti-Semitism.  There s no end to this responsibility for people born afterwards and no exceptions for immigrants,  he said, adding that those who burned Israeli flags did not understand or respect what it meant to be German. In an interview with the Funke newspaper consortium, Israel s ambassador in Berlin Jeremy Issacharoff called for a ban on burning flags.  Anyone who burns flags questions Israel s right to exist,  he said. Stephan Kramer, the head of a state intelligence agency in the eastern region of Thuringia, warned in Der Spiegel that anti-Semitism was becoming  ever more uninhibited  and many Jews were too scared to identify themselves as such.

        "title": "U.S. energy head: Nuclear power rescue helps national security",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. energy secretary defended his plan to reward nuclear plants with incentives against criticism it would manipulate markets by telling a congressional hearing on Thursday that a strong domestic nuclear industry boosted national security.  Rick Perry pushed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Sept. 29 to issue a rule within 60 days that would reward aging nuclear and coal-fired power plants that store 90 days of fuel on site. He has said those plants should be supported for their ability to boost the reliability of the U.S. power grid.  Many U.S. representatives at the hearing, including Democrat Frank Pallone, said the plan favored aging industries, killed free markets and would saddle consumers with higher power bills. One lawmaker pointed to a study by ICF Consulting that said power bills could rise $800 million to $3.2 billion annually if FERC issued Perry\u2019s plan.   But Perry said the federal government had disregarded nuclear power for decades at a risk to national security. \u201cIf we lose our supply chain, if we lose our intellectual chain of supply of bright scientists because we basically pushed the nuclear industry back, then we\u2019re going to lose our role as a leader when it comes to nuclear energy in the world,\u201d Perry said. That in turn could hurt the country\u2019s ability to address nuclear nonproliferation, Perry said.  The United States has more nuclear power reactors than any other country. But Russia, China and other countries are rapidly building nuclear plants and some in the industry worry those countries could become the world\u2019s top nuclear innovators.  Perry\u2019s plan has divided the energy industry, with coal and nuclear interests squaring off against natural gas drillers, solar and wind power, and consumer groups. It is unclear what FERC will decide on the plan. The agency, an independent arm of the Energy Department, declined a request to lengthen a comment period on Perry\u2019s plan.   Republican Representative Pete Olson suggested that Perry was more in favor of free energy markets when he was governor of Texas. But Perry said the notion that energy markets were free and without subsidies was a \u201cfallacy.\u201d Pallone said a study that Perry had directed Energy Department staff to conduct concluded the grid was already reliable and that most recent grid outages were caused by problems in energy transmission, not by power plants. Several coal plants were forced to shut by recent hurricanes because their mounds of coal supply were soaked by heavy rains.   Perry said his plan was a directive for FERC, but he added that he initiated it to start a conversation about protecting people from outages during extreme storms.  ",

        "text": "GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Clashes between Congolese troops and supporters of a renegade colonel in Congo s eastern city of Bukavu killed seven people on Sunday before he surrendered and turned himself in to U.N. peacekeepers, the army said. Democratic Republic of Congo army spokesman for South Kivu province, Dieudonne Kasereka, said clashes had started after police came to disarm Colonel Abbas Kayonga, who was sacked on Thursday from his post overseeing anti-fraud efforts in local mines. Kayonga, a former rebel from a group that had been disarmed and integrated into the Congolese military, gave himself up at the local base for the U.N. mission to Congo.  He has just surrendered with 17 people at the base of the mission,  Kasereka said by telephone. Two army soldiers and three of Kanyonga s bodyguards were killed in the fighting and two civilians were killed by stray bullets, he said. Seventeen members of Kanyonga s force surrendered to U.N. troops and nine others were captured by the army, Kasereka said, adding that soldiers found about a dozen heavy weapons at Kanyonga s house. Security has been deteriorating across Congo since the end of last year, when President Joseph Kabila refused to step down despite his mandate expiring.  Surging militia violence in the east, which has for decades been a tinderbox of ethnic rivalries fueled by the region s mineral wealth, and in the formerly peaceful central Kasai region, have raised fears the country could slip back to the multi-faceted civil wars of the turn of the century.  Those wars killed hundreds of thousands directly in violence while millions of others are thought to have died from of hunger and disease.  South Kivu has rich deposits of gold, tin and coltan, used in mobile phones, which have long helped finance rebel groups and army officers. The national electoral commission was expected to announce a date for the election to replace Kabila later on Sunday. Last month, it said the election cannot take place until April 2019, raising fears of an escalation in militia violence and civil disturbances.  U.S. envoy Nikki Haley said during a visit to meet with Kabila last month that the vote must happen in 2018 or it will lose international support. ",

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Ethnic minorities in Britain have a lower employment rate than white people and are under-represented in senior public sector jobs, Prime Minister Theresa May will say on Tuesday, releasing the findings of a government audit on racial disparity.   Bogged down by Brexit and a botched snap election since taking control of the ruling Conservative party last July, May has struggled to deliver on social reforms to tackle what she has called  burning injustices  that exist in Britain. Attempting to relaunch that agenda, May will publish the findings of a  Race Disparity Audit , which will not, she says, come as a surprise to many.   People who have lived with discrimination don t need a government audit to make them aware of the scale of the challenge,  May will say according to extracts of remarks due to be delivered at a launch event on Tuesday.

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - From plush penthouse apartments on the Upper East Side to bars in midtown Manhattan, New York\u2019s financial community watched in stunned dismay on Wednesday as Republican Donald Trump clinched the White House. An early party mood quickly soured as donors and supporters of Hillary Clinton realized that the Democratic candidate, Wall Street\u2019s preferred choice because she represented the status quo, had lost. Many were stuck for words. \u201cNot really much to say,\u201d said Marc Lasry, a billionaire credit investor. Trump\u2019s unpredictable pronouncements and opposition to free-trade agreements have made the real estate mogul unpopular with many financiers, who fear that he could disrupt global trade and damage geopolitical relationships. The U.S. dollar sank and stocks plummeted as investors fled risky assets. S&P 500 index futures crashed. Joseph Peiffer, a lawyer who has represented investors and others in class-action lawsuits, cracked open a third bottle of wine, his \u201conly in the case of an emergency\u201d bottle, while watching the returns during an election night party he hosted for about 20 friends and family members in his hometown of New Orleans. \u201cThis seems like enough of an emergency to break it open,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s pronouncements on the financial sector have perplexed Wall Street. On the one hand, he has pledged to dismantle much of the regulation put in place after the financial crisis, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. On the other hand, he has called for a \u201c21st century\u201d version of the 1933 Glass-Steagall law that required the separation of commercial and investment banking. Trump has not said what that version would entail other than saying that he would prioritize \u201chelping African-American businesses get the credit they need.\u201d  \u201cSometimes you hear him on the stump criticizing the banks,\u201d Peiffer said. \u201cThen his policy paper says he wants to deregulate the bank. The two things don\u2019t jive. But who knows what he really thinks. And we won\u2019t know that until he does it.\u201d For Trump supporters who work on Wall Street, his victory is a vindication. \u201cI\u2019m very happy,\u201d said Matthew Tyrmand, a private investor and contributor to the Breitbart News website, who was attending a Young Republicans party at a bar off Madison Avenue. Tyrmand, who had shorted stocks ahead of the election - a bet that stock prices will fall - said he had been called \u201cdelusional\u201d for predicting a Trump win. Tyrmand said Trump would be good news for markets because he understands the benefit of letting businesses fail. He predicted equity markets would go through a prolonged correction before recovering. \u201cWe will be healthier long term,\u201d he said. Around Tyrmand, other Trump supporters hugged one another, sang \u201cGod Bless America\u201d, clinked glasses and called out \u201cM-A-G-A!\u201d - the acronym for Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d  But in one corner of the bar, a man and a woman downed shots before starting on fresh pints of beer. Asked if the drinks were out of celebration or depression, the response was quick: \u201cDepression,\u201d the man said, declining to give his name. \u201cBut either way we drink\u201d Matthew Farley, a lawyer with Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP in New York, said he had been warning friends and colleagues about an electoral upset for months.  \u201cI told them that ... a significant portion of the country wanted someone to do a cannonball into the pool and mess up the status quo,\u201d said Farley, who advises Wall Street brokerages on regulation and arbitration issues. \u201cThe cannonball party is not united. They\u2019re progressives and conservatives, but they\u2019re fed up with the status quo and all they know is that anything is better than what we got.\u201d Trump supporter Steven Chiavarone, associate portfolio manager for Federated Global Investment Management Corp, a fund that invests in stocks, bonds and currencies globally, said the market gyrations should not be seen as a harbinger of doom. \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t end.

        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany s three would-be coalition partners went deep into overtime in talks on Saturday as they sought enough common ground in climate and migration policy to form a government and stave off the prospect of a repeat election. Incumbent chancellor Angela Merkel s only realistic hope of securing a fourth term after suffering losses in September s election is an awkward three-way conservative-liberal-Green alliance. But after four weeks of talks, the parties remained far apart as they adjourned for the night. The biggest sticking points are climate change, where the Greens want emissions cuts that the other parties see as economically ruinous, and immigration, where Merkel s arch-conservative allies in Bavaria insist on stricter rules.  With the pro-business, tax-cutting Free Democrat (FDP) liberals freshly returned to parliament after four years in the wilderness, and the Greens out of office for 12 years, neither is keen to give ground. A self-imposed deadline of Thursday for wrapping up exploratory talks and starting formal coalition negotiations passed without agreement, forcing the conservatives to promise further concessions on emissions cuts to the Greens. FDP leader Christian Lindner said the talks now had to be wrapped up by 1700 GMT on Sunday. But President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a former foreign minister who now plays an apolitical role, said brinkmanship was to be expected.  Before the formal talks start, there are always attempts by parties to drive prices up,  he told the weekly Welt am Sonntag.  What we ve seen in the past weeks isn t so different from previous coalition negotiations.  Greens chairwoman Simone Peter said much that had earlier been agreed on emissions policy had been undone, without giving details. Bavaria s Christian Social Union (CSU) faces regional state elections next year, and fears the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) could unseat it after 60 years if it fails to secure tough immigration rules - which are anathema to the left-leaning Greens. Among its demands are a cap of 200,000 per year on the number of refugees Germany will take, and an end to the practice of allowing successful asylum seekers to bring their immediate families to join them. All parties are anxious to avoid a repeat election, which they fear could boost the AfD, which surged into parliament for the first time in September s national election. But the heterogeneous three-way coalition, made necessary after the conservatives and the centre-left suffered punishing election losses, is untested at national level. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government\u2019s costs could increase by $2.3 billion in 2018 if Congress and President Donald Trump decide not to fund Obamacare-related payments to health insurers, according to a study released Tuesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The payments amount to about $7 billion in fiscal year 2017 and help cover out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income Americans who purchase insurance on the individual insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare.  Trump has threatened to withhold the payments to force Democrats to the negotiating table on a healthcare bill to replace Obamacare.  He has also said he will fund the subsidies if Democrats agree to funding for his proposed border wall with Mexico as part of efforts to pass a government funding bill this week and avert a shutdown. Democrats have rejected the conditional offer.  If no deal is made, parts of the federal government will shut down at 12:01 am on Saturday. The payments are the subject of a pending Republican lawsuit that was appealed by the Obama administration and put on hold when Trump took office.  The government could save $10 billion by revoking the payments, Kaiser said. But insurers that remain in the market would have to hike premiums nearly 20 percent to cover their losses, Kaiser found, so the government would have to spend $12.3 billion on tax credits to help pay for Americans\u2019 premium costs - a net increase of 23 percent on federal spending on marketplace subsidies. The projection assumes that insurers remain in the marketplace next year. Health policy experts have said without the payments, many insurers could not afford to stay in the market and will likely exit, which would leave some U.S. counties without an insurer.  Aetna (AET.N), UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Humana (HUM.N) have already exited most state exchanges for 2017 and said they will do so next year as well. ",

        "title": "California Democrats propose series of infrastructure bills",
        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Democrats in California\u2019s state Senate announced on Tuesday a series of infrastructure funding bills that would invest billions in roads, bridges, housing and water projects. Infrastructure investment has been at the forefront of political agendas this year, from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s promise to unveil a massive national infrastructure spending plan to voters\u2019 support of billions of dollars of infrastructure bonds in November\u2019s election. Both Trump and his rival, Hillary Clinton, campaigned promising infrastructure investment. Trump called for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending over 10 years, but it remains unclear how much would come from the federal budget. Democrats in the California Senate proposed five bills on Tuesday, including one that would use $6 billion a year over the next decade to repair roads and bridges and improve transit systems across the state.  According to the proposal, the bulk of the money is to be raised through a phased-in 12 cent per gallon gas tax increase, along with increases to the diesel excise tax and vehicle registration fees. California\u2019s freeway system faces a $59 billion maintenance shortfall over the next decade and local governments face another $78 billion shortfall for local highways and bridges. The need for infrastructure funding is echoed across the country.  \u201cOur transportation infrastructure is in dire condition. The longer we wait to fix it, the more it will cost us,\u201d State Senator Jim Beall of San Jose and sponsor of the transportation bill, said in a statement. Two housing bills raise money for affordable housing, one of them through a $75 fee on real estate transaction documents. California is home to 21 of the 30 most expensive rental housing markets in the country, and many parts of the state face serious housing shortages. Another bill proposes to issue a $3 billion general obligation bond aimed at addressing the housing stock shortage. Senator Toni Atkins of San Diego, sponsor of one of the housing bills, said infrastructure was \u201cat the top of the list\u201d of challenges facing California, and Tuesday\u2019s package of bills would \u201cgo a long way toward improving quality of life for Californians and grow our state\u2019s economy.\u201d Another bill would fund state and local parks and water infrastructure through a $3 billion general obligation bond. Despite recent rains, California is in the fifth year of  drought. In 2014, state voters passed a $7.5 billion bond to fund water infrastructure projects throughout California.  Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n of Los Angeles, sponsor of Tuesday\u2019s bill, noted that there is still \u201ca high unmet demand for new water and natural resource investment.\u201d ",

Ships are not yet allowed to enter the port along the Neches River because of extreme river currents from Hurricane Harvey, said Scott Whalen, director of the USCG\u2019s Vessel Tracking Service at Port Arthur.  The largest crude oil processor in the United States, Motiva Enterprises\u2019 Port Arthur Refinery, sits along the port.

        "title": "Watchdog presses U.S. lawmakers to probe Icahn's role with Trump",
        "text": "(Reuters) - A government watchdog group, Public Citizen, said on Wednesday it has asked lawmakers to investigate whether Carl Icahn violated lobbying disclosure laws, a complaint the billionaire investor denied and called a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d The group said Icahn may have been acting as a lobbyist when he advised President Donald Trump to overhaul the U.S. biofuels program. Icahn, an unpaid adviser to Trump on regulation, submitted a proposal to Trump last month to change the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard by shifting the burden of blending biofuels into gasoline away from oil refining companies, and further down the supply chain to marketers. Public Citizen said that, because Icahn owns a controlling stake in a refinery that could benefit from the proposed change, he may have been required by a 1995 lobbying disclosure law to disclose his discussions with Trump on the subject as lobbying. The group said it has made its request for a probe in a letter sent to Congress on Wednesday morning. \u201cAll of this has occurred with no record of any (Lobbying Disclosure Act) filings by or on behalf of Mr. Icahn,\u201d Public Citizen said in a copy of the letter provided to Reuters. Icahn did not respond to Reuters requests for comment but described the complaint in an opinion piece on The Hill website as a \u201cgross misstatement of the facts\u201d and said he had vetted his activities with lawyers.  The RFS, signed into law by former President George W. Bush, requires oil companies to mix increasing levels of renewable fuels into gasoline and diesel each year - a requirement that many refiners say costs them millions of dollars. Oil companies can either blend biofuels or buy paper credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RIN), from those that have. Icahn owns an 82-percent stake in refiner CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N), which along with other refining companies, has urged the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to shift the blending obligation away from them. \u201cWhile we are not fighting the Renewable Fuel Standard, I have for months and will continue to speak out against the misguided way in which the EPA has been administering the RFS\u201d with regards to the agency\u2019s handling of a \u201ccorrupt\u201d RIN market, Icahn said. Efforts to reach the White House were not immediately successful. \u201cCarl Icahn is between an ethics rock and a lobbying hard place,\u201d said Norman Eisen, co-founder of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington who served as the chief ethics lawyer for former President Barack Obama. \u201cIf he claims he is an informal advisor, then he is subject to lobbying rules.\u201d Icahn has disclosed his role as a Trump adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but he has not registered as a lobbyist. Several Democratic lawmakers have said they want more information about his role in the Trump administration.  Shares of CVR Energy jumped over 1 percent following Icahn\u2019s response but pared gains and was unchanged at $21.40 by 3:47 p.m. EST  (2047 GMT). Share values have risen about 70 percent since the presidential election. Over that time, Icahn\u2019s stake has gained over $600 million in value, according to Reuters data.  Last week, the head of a U.S. biofuels group said Icahn told him that Trump was readying an executive order to change the point of obligation for blending under the biofuels program, something both the White House and Icahn have denied. The White House has said it is reviewing Icahn\u2019s proposal and has not yet taken a position.     ",

        "title": "U.S. sanctions Chechen leader, four others under Magnitsky Act",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday imposed new sanctions on five Russians and Chechens, including the head of the Russian republic of Chechnya, for alleged human rights abuses.  The new sanctions blacklisted Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader and a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Treasury Department said in a statement.  U.S. authorities accused Kadyrov of overseeing  an administration involved in disappearances and extrajudicial killings . On a conference call with reporters Wednesday, a senior U.S. State Department official said that  one or more of Kadyrov s political opponents were killed at his direction.   Kadyrov reacted to news of the sanctions with his usual defiance.  A sleepless night is waiting for me,  Kadyrov wrote, apparently sarcastically, on his Instagram social media account.  I can be proud that I m out of favor with the special services of the USA. In fact, the USA cannot forgive me for dedicating my whole life to the fight against foreign terrorists among which there are bastards of America s special services.  He also wrote that he would not be visiting the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department imposed the sanctions, which freeze the banks accounts of those targeted, under a 2012 law known as the Magnitsky Act.  The Magnitsky Act imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials linked to the death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old Russian auditor and whistleblower. The act also seeks to hold responsible those U.S. authorities allege orchestrated or benefited from the death of Magnitsky.   Treasury remains committed to holding accountable those involved in the Sergei Magnitsky affair, including those with a role in the criminal conspiracy and fraud scheme that he uncovered,  Director of the Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control John Smith said in a statement. Magnitsky was arrested and died in a Moscow jail in 2009 after discovering a $230 million tax fraud scheme, according to U.S. authorities. Supporters of Magnitsky say the Russian state murdered him by denying him adequate medical care after he was imprisoned on tax evasion charges. The Kremlin denies the allegation. In addition to Kadyrov and one other Chechen official, the Treasury s action on Wednesday targeted three Russians that U.S. authorities say were involved in the complex tax fraud scheme that Magnitsky exposed. The Magnitsky sanctions have been a point of tension between Moscow and Washington, even before Russia s annexation of Crimea sent relations spiraling. In retaliation for the Magnitsky Act, Putin signed a bill halting U.S. adoptions of Russian children. It had been unclear to sanctions experts whether President Donald Trump s administration, which has signaled a desire to rebuild ties with Moscow, would continue to target people under the law.  The Magnitsky Act attracted greater public attention when it emerged that the president s son Donald Trump Jr., had met with a Russian lawyer and a lobbyist - both strident opponents of the law - in New York ahead of the 2016 U.S. elections. When asked about the June 2016 meeting, Trump Jr. later said they discussed the adoptions issue. On a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, State Department officials said that despite the new sanctions the Trump administration wants a constructive relationship with Moscow.  We believe a Russia that takes care of the human rights of its own citizens will be an even more effective partner,  a senior State Department official said. ",

        "title": "Argentina's Fernandez charged with treason, arrest sought",
        "text": "BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A federal judge in Argentina indicted former President Cristina Fernandez for treason and asked for her arrest for allegedly covering up Iran s possible role in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center that killed 85 people, a court ruling said. As Fernandez is a senator, Congress would first have to vote to strip her of parliamentary immunity for an arrest to occur. The judge, Claudio Bonadio, also indicted and ordered house arrest for Fernandez s Foreign Minister Hector Timerman, the 491-page ruling said. Fernandez called a news conference in Congress to deny wrongdoing and accuse Bonadio and President Mauricio Macri of degrading the judiciary.  It is an invented case about facts that did not exist,  she said, dressed in white. Timerman s lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment. While removing immunity from lawmakers is rare in Argentina, Congress voted on Oct. 25 to do so for Fernandez s former planning minister Julio De Vido and he was arrested the same day. De Vido is accused of fraud and corruption, which he denies. Argentina s legislature has entered a period of judicial recess until March but can be convened for urgent matters.    Fernandez and her allies have been the focus of several high profile cases with arrests and indictments since center-right Mauricio Macri defeated her chosen successor and was elected president in late 2015. Fernandez left office just a few months before the Congress in neighboring Brazil impeached another leftist female leader, Dilma Rousseff for breaking budget laws. The cover-up allegations against Fernandez gained international attention in January 2015, when the prosecutor who initially made them, Alberto Nisman, was found shot dead in the bathroom of his Buenos Aires apartment. An Argentine appeals court a year ago ordered the re-opening of the investigation.  Nisman s death was classified as a suicide, though an official investigating the case has said the shooting appeared to be a homicide. Nisman s body was discovered hours before he was to brief Congress on the bombing of the AMIA center.  GRAINS-FOR-OIL Nisman said Fernandez worked behind the scenes to clear Iran and normalize relations to clinch a grains-for-oil deal with Tehran that was signed in 2013. The agreement created a joint commission to investigate the AMIA bombing that critics said was really a means to absolve Iran. Argentine, Israeli and U.S. officials have long blamed the AMIA attack on Hezbollah guerrillas backed by Iran. Tehran has denied links to the attack.  Earlier on Thursday, two lower level allies of Fernandez were arrested based on the same ruling from judge Bonadio: Carlos Zannini, a legal adviser, and Luis D Elia, the leader of a group of protesters supporting her government.  Zannini s lawyer, Alejandro Baldin, told local media the detention was  arbitrary, illegal and ran over constitutional and individual rights,  after leaving a police station in Rio Gallegos, where Zannini was held. D Elia s lawyer, Adrian Albor, told radio Del Plata that Bonadio had no respect for the law, rights, justice.  They are coming for everyone in the previous government.   Bonadio wrote in his ruling that evidence showed Iran, with the help of Argentine citizens, had appeared to achieve its goal of avoiding being declared a  terrorist  state by Argentina. The crime of treason is punishable by 10 to 25 years in prison, Argentina s maximum sentence. The next step in the case would be an oral trial and sentences can be appealed on first instance, which could be a long process.  Macri s leader in the Senate, Federico Pinedo, said on Twitter that Congress would analyze the request to strip immunity  with sincerity and responsibility.   Macri s coalition performed better than expected in Oct. 22 mid-term elections, gaining seats in Congress, but it is not clear if lawmakers will vote to strip Fernandez s immunity. Fernandez, who governed from 2007 to 2015, finished second to a Macri ally in the Buenos Aires province Senate race but won a seat under Argentina s list system. She was sworn in last week.  She was also indicted in late 2016 on charges she ran a corruption scheme with her public works secretary. Fernandez has admitted there may have been corruption in her government but personally denies wrongdoing. ",

        "text": "OSLO (Reuters) - A survivor of the Hiroshima atomic bombing and the leader of the group that won this year s Nobel Peace Prize on Saturday urged the United States and North Korea to tone down their rhetoric and negotiate together to avoid a nuclear strike. Tensions have risen markedly in recent months over North Korea s development, in defiance of repeated rounds of U.N. sanctions, of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the United States. A missile test last week prompted a U.S. warning that North Korea s leadership would be  utterly destroyed  if war were to break out. The Pentagon has mounted repeated shows of force after North Korean tests. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) was awarded this year s Nobel Peace Prize by a Nobel committee that cited the spread of nuclear weapons by countries like North Korea and the growing risk of an atomic war.  Graphic of Nobel laureates: tmsnrt.rs/2y6ATVW Setsuko Thurlow, an 85-year-old survivor of the Hiroshima bombing on Aug. 6, 1945, and Beatrice Fihn, ICAN s executive director, will receive the prize together on Sunday at Oslo City Hall in front of King Harald and Queen Sonja.   No human being should suffer what we suffered,  Thurlow, who was 13 at the time of the attack and is now an ICAN campaigner, told reporters on Saturday.   I deeply and strongly urge the leaders of North Korea and the U.S. never to use nuclear weapons ... Negotiate.   A diplomatic solution is the only solution.  ICAN s Fihn said that the risk of a nuclear war had increased over the past year.  There is an urgent threat right now,  she told reporters.  I would very strongly urge the leaders (of North Korea and the U.S.) to back down from their very dangerous rhetoric. Stop threatening to use weapons of mass destruction. Engage in a diplomatic solution.  ICAN is a coalition of grassroots non-governmental groups in more than 100 nations that began in Australia. It has campaigned for a U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was adopted by 122 nations in July.  It needs to be ratified by 50 states to come into force. So far only three have done so: the Holy See, Thailand and Guyana. The treaty is not signed by - and would not apply to - any of the states that already have nuclear arms, which include the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France, as well as India, Pakistan and North Korea.       Israel is also widely assumed to have nuclear weapons, although it neither confirms nor denies it.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscow\u2019s official support for his father, according to emails released on Tuesday. The emails, released by Donald Trump Jr., are the most concrete evidence yet that Trump campaign officials welcomed Russian help to win the election, a subject that has cast a cloud over Trump\u2019s presidency and spurred investigations by the Justice Department and Congress. The messages show that the younger Trump was open to the prospect of \u201cvery high level and sensitive information\u201d from a Russian attorney that a go-between described as \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump\u201d ahead of a meeting on June 9, 2016.  \"If it's what you say I love it,\" Trump Jr. responded. He released the messages on Twitter after the New York Times said it planned to write about them and sought comment from him. (bit.ly/2uapeCK and bit.ly/2ua9hwg)     In an interview with Fox News, Trump Jr. said that Trump\u2019s campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a top White House adviser, also attended the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who denies having Kremlin ties. He said Veselnitskaya did not provide any damaging information about Clinton at the meeting and instead sought to discuss Russian sanctions. \u201cIn retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, this was opposition research.\u201d Nevertheless, the correspondence between him and Rob Goldstone, a publicist who arranged the meeting, could provide fodder for U.S. investigators probing whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with the Kremlin. \u201cThe crown prosecutor of Russia ... offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,\u201d Goldstone wrote Trump Jr. on June 3. Russia does not have a \u201ccrown prosecutor\u201d - the equivalent title is prosecutor general. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow sought to help Trump win the election, in part by releasing private emails from Democratic Party officials. \u201cThe conversation will now turn to whether President Trump was personally involved or not. But the question of the campaign\u2019s involvement appears settled now,\u201d Cornell Law School professor Jens David Ohlin said in an interview. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d  Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Trump Jr. said he did not tell his father about the meeting. He said he may have since had contact with other Russians. \u201cI\u2019ve probably met with other people from Russia, but certainly not in the context of actual formalized meetings or anything,\u201d he said on Fox News. The news jarred financial markets as investors worried it presented a fresh distraction from the administration\u2019s economic agenda. Stocks and the dollar fell, while U.S. Treasury securities gained ground. Stocks later retraced most of their losses after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged to keep lawmakers in Washington longer than scheduled to push through a bill to overhaul healthcare. Along with his younger brother Eric, Trump Jr. oversees the Trump Organization, his father\u2019s real-estate and business empire, and does not have a formal role in the White House. \u201cMy son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency,\u201d Trump said in a statement. The White House referred questions to lawyers for Trump and his son. The emails do not appear to provide evidence of illegal activity, but legal experts say Trump Jr. could run into trouble if investigators find he aided a criminal action, such as hacking into Democratic computer networks, or violated campaign-finance laws by accepting gifts from foreign entities. He is likely to face scrutiny from both congressional committees investigating the matter.  The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to call on him to testify and to provide documents, according to a Senate source, while the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee wants to interview him and everybody else involved in the meeting, said the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Representative Adam Schiff. \u201cThe American people need to know that our president is acting on their behalf and not acting because he has a fear that the Russians could disclose things that would harm him or his family,\u201d Schiff told reporters. On Fox News, Trump Jr. said he was \u201cmore than happy to cooperate with everyone.\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, a Republican, asked the Trump administration how Veselnitskaya was able to enter the United States even though her authorization had expired. CNN reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is heading a criminal investigation at the Justice Department, also planned to look into the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence, who has said the campaign had no contacts with Russia, said through a spokesman he was not aware of the meeting, held before he became Trump\u2019s running mate later that summer. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is at times harshly critical of Trump, told reporters: \u201cThis is very problematic. We cannot allow foreign governments to reach out to anybody\u2019s campaign and say: \u2018We\u2019d like to help you.\u2019\u201d ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (IFR) - Jared Kushner has divested his equity interest in 666 Fifth Avenue, a 39-story office and retail building on Manhattan\u2019s famed shopping area, according to a spokesperson at Kushner Companies. Kushner said he would step down as CEO of Kushner Companies, a family owned real estate company, and begin to divest himself of substantial assets after he was made a senior White House advisor to US President Donald Trump, his father-in-law. \u201cMr. Kushner divested his equity interest in 666 Fifth Avenue, and has no role in the management or operations of the property,\u201d a Kushner Companies spokesperson said in an emailed statement to IFR. \u201cMr. Kushner\u2019s ownership interests were sold using a third-party appraisal for fair market value to a family trust, of which he is not a beneficiary,\u201d the spokesperson said. Neither Ivanka Trump nor her and Kushner\u2019s children are beneficiaries to the family trust, the spokesperson also confirmed. When asked by IFR, Kushner Companies declined to give any detail about the sale price of the equity stake and declined to discuss any aspect of the outstanding debt on the property. Kushner bought the property for US$1.8bn in 2007 - the highest price ever paid for a single office building sale in the United States at the time, according to Kroll Bond Rating Agency - but it was last valued well below that level. The last appraisal, completed in 2011 as part of a debt restructuring, valued the building at just US$820m. Kroll, which said the building was 20% vacant as of July 2016, valued the property at US$982.1m. Kushner and his partners in 666 Fifth took out US$1.2bn of senior debt to buy the property, which was later packaged and sold into three CMBS deals. It is not clear what the divestiture means for the debt on the property. The senior debt was restructured in 2011 and extended to February 2019. As part of the restructuring, Kushner brought in Vornado Realty as a partner. A call and email to Vornado was not immediately returned. ",

        "title": "Under pressure from Trump, Price resigns as health secretary over private plane uproar",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned under pressure from President Donald Trump on Friday in an uproar over Price\u2019s use of costly private charter planes for government business. His abrupt departure was announced an hour after Trump told reporters he was disappointed in Price\u2019s use of private aircraft and did not like the way it reflected on his administration. \u201cSecretary of Health and Human Services Thomas Price offered his resignation earlier today and the president accepted,\u201d the White House said in a statement. Trump named Don Wright to serve as acting secretary. Wright is currently the deputy assistant secretary for health and director of the office of disease prevention and health promotion. \u201cI\u2019m not happy. OK? I\u2019m not happy,\u201d Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn. Candidates to succeed Price included Seema Verma, who is administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and who is close to Vice President Mike Pence, and Scott Gottlieb, a physician who serves as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, according to industry analysts. Several sources saw Gottlieb as a clear front runner. They said he got along well with the White House and is viewed favorably there. Price\u2019s resignation leaves Trump with a second Cabinet position to fill. He has yet to pick a secretary for homeland security after hiring former Secretary John Kelly as his White House chief of staff.     It was the latest blow to the Trump White House, which has struggled to get major legislative achievements passed by Congress and has been embroiled in one controversy after another since Trump took office in January. Price, a former congressman, was instrumental in the Trump administration\u2019s policies aimed at undercutting Obamacare, as well as working with governors across the country to slowly begin unraveling parts of the law. In a resignation letter, Price offered little in the way of contrition. He said he had been working to reform the U.S. healthcare system and reduce regulatory burdens, among other goals. \u201cI have spent forty years both as a doctor and public servant putting people first. I regret that the recent events have created a distraction from these important objectives,\u201d he said. Trump, currently trying to sell his tax cut plan and oversee the federal response to devastation wreaked by three hurricanes, saw the Price drama as an unnecessary distraction and behind the scenes was telling aides \u201cwhat was he thinking?,\u201d a source close to the president said. Price promised on Thursday to repay the nearly $52,000 cost of his seats on private charter flights. \u201cThe taxpayers won\u2019t pay a dime for my seat on those planes,\u201d Price said. But that was not enough to satisfy Trump. Trump told reporters that the \u201coptics\u201d of Price\u2019s travel were not good, since, as president he was trying to renegotiate U.S. contracts to get a better deal for taxpayers. \u201cLook, I think he\u2019s a very fine person. I certainly don\u2019t like the optics,\u201d Trump said. Price had also been seen in the White House as having been ineffective in getting Congress to pass healthcare reform legislation, an effort that has fizzled on Capitol Hill. Price was one of a handful of senior officials in Trump\u2019s administration put on the defensive over reports about their use of charter flights and government aircraft, sometimes for personal travel, when they could have flown commercial for less money. The White House issued an order late on Friday saying use of private planes required approval from White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and that the commercial air system was appropriate even for very senior officials with few exceptions. The Washington Post on Friday reported that Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin attended a Wimbledon tennis match, toured Westminster Abbey and took a cruise on the Thames this summer during a 10-day trip to discuss veterans\u2019 health issues in Britain and Denmark. Shulkin, who traveled on a commercial airline, was accompanied on the trip by his wife, whose airfare was paid for by the government and who received a per diem for meals, the Post said, noting that the Department of Veterans Affairs said she was traveling on \u201capproved invitational orders.\u201d His six-person traveling party included an acting undersecretary of health and her husband as well as two aides. They were accompanied by a security detail of as many as six people, the Post said.  Washington news media outlet Politico has reported that Price had taken at least two dozen private charter flights since May at a cost to U.S. taxpayers of more than $400,000. Politico also reported he took approved military flights to Africa and Europe costing $500,000. Senior U.S. government officials travel frequently, but are generally expected to keep costs down by taking commercial flights or the train when possible. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have also been in the spotlight for their travel habits. ",

        "title": "Eastern Europe's nationalists feel vindicated by German vote",
        "text": "BUDAPEST/WARSAW (Reuters) - Wary of German Chancellor Angela Merkel s ambition for closer European Union integration, right-wing politicians in the EU s eastern wing are touting her weak election victory as a vindication of their concerns. Eurosceptic governments in Poland and Hungary have been vocal in criticizing Merkel s  open-door  approach to migration and opposing EU reforms that would transfer more power to the Brussels institutions at the expense of national governments. Poland s foreign minister said Germany s Sept. 24 election, in which Merkel s conservative bloc won the lowest number of votes since 1949, was proof that Berlin would have to heed the concerns of eastern member states.  She should focus on maintaining the unity of the European Union,  Witold Waszczykowski told Polska the Times newspaper.  Mrs Merkel will have to look for new allies   and this in turn opens room for maneuver for Polish diplomacy.   Today, there is no climate for federalization and there won t be one in the nearest future.  Merkel is expected to take months to build a new coalition government, reducing German pressure on Warsaw and Budapest to comply with EU standards. Her most likely coalition allies are the increasingly eurosceptic, pro-business Free Democrats and the Greens - but she also faces a more divided Bundestag lower house, where the  anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) is now the third biggest party. Nationalist politicians in the EU s eastern member states hope the rise of the AfD, the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag in decades, will force Merkel to harden her stance on immigration after Germany admitted more than one million migrants and refugees, mostly Muslims, in 2015-16. Hungary has already said German politicians since the election have endorsed its measures to beef up its border security to discourage migrants from entering the EU.  About some aspects of illegal migration we are still in debate, but there is full agreement on the principal issue that the protection of the external borders of Europe is very important,  Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said after meeting senior German lawmakers in the city of Stuttgart last week. The head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has invited the leaders of the four  Visegrad  states - Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia - to a dinner in Brussels on Oct. 18, ahead of an EU summit, to try to ease tensions between them and wealthier western Europe. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban s Fidesz party and Merkel s CDU-CSU are in the same political family in the European Parliament, and despite Berlin s criticism of his record in government, has welcomed Merkel s election victory.   Let s quietly pray every evening for the extension of the mandate of the current chancellor,  he said before the election. Orban himself faces an election next April in which he will seek a third consecutive term, and he probably does not want to tackle EU reform issues head-on now, analysts said.   Orban s objective is to keep the margin of maneuver open  as long as possible: he does not want to face yes-or-no questions like whether to take Hungary into the euro zone or stay on the periphery anytime soon,  Botond Feledy, senior fellow at the Centre for Euro-Atlantic Integration and Democracy in Budapest.  GERMAN-FRENCH AXIS But once Merkel has bedded down a new coalition in Berlin, Budapest and Warsaw can expect a resumption of pressure over their record on democracy and rule of law from a reinvigorated partnership between Germany and Emmanuel Macron s France. Analysts said Merkel and Macron, both keen to overcome EU disunity, may try to pick off more cooperative eastern states such as Slovakia and the Czech Republic in order to concentrate pressure on Poland and Hungary to comply with EU rules. Merkel may also in due course revive her demands on the eastern states to take in more migrants as she seeks to blunt the allure of the AfD at home for conservative German voters. Warsaw, currently under an unprecedented EU investigation over its rule of law standards, is bracing for renewed criticism.  We are expecting Merkel to get tough on Poland - definitely not in the next few months while the new government is being formed, but after the domestic dust has settled,  a Polish government source added.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People would be able to bring legal, concealed guns into any U.S. state under legislation the House of Representatives approved on Wednesday that would also bolster the national background check system and require a study of the \u201cbump stocks\u201d used in October\u2019s Las Vegas mass shooting. The country\u2019s long-standing fight over gun ownership has grown more heated since a single person killed 58 people and injured more than 500 at a music festival in Las Vegas, Nevada, the deadliest mass shooting carried out by an individual in U.S. history. Stephen Paddock boosted his firearms with bump stocks to shoot thousands of bullets over 10 minutes. On a vote of 231 to 198, the Republican-led House approved the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which would require states to recognize each others\u2019 permits for carrying hidden and loaded firearms while in public. States\u2019 requirements on concealed guns vary widely. Some states deny permits to people who have committed domestic violence or other crimes. Eight do not require permits at all.  Supporters of the bill, which still must be approved by the Senate, say states recognize each others\u2019 drivers licenses and other permits, making concealed-carry permits the exception.  Detractors say the bill tramples states\u2019 rights and that gun permits differ from drivers\u2019 licenses, which are generally uniform across the country. They also say that, under the legislation, gun owners will only have to abide by requirements of the most lenient states. The bill passed eight days before the fifth anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting in which 20 children and six adults perished. So far this year, 14,412 people have died and 29,277 have been injured in firearm-related incidents in the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive. About 8 percent of them were children and teenagers. Bill supporters also pointed to last month\u2019s Texas shooting, where a man fired his rifle on a fleeing gunman who had just killed 26 worshippers at a church. The gunman was later found dead in his car. \u201cWe know that citizens who carry a concealed firearm are not only better prepared to act in their own\u00a0self-defense, but also in the defense of others,\u201d said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican. The legislation also included a bipartisan measure to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Meanwhile, the Justice Department has already begun studying bump stocks, and could soon ban them. ",

        "title": "Yellen faces tough sell on Fed rate hikes in Congress",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will defend the U.S. central bank\u2019s first rate hike in a decade and likely insist that further rises this year remain on track, albeit at a slower pace, when she addresses Congress on Wednesday. Yellen, who is certain to be grilled by lawmakers on whether the economy really is ready for higher rates, will point to continued strong jobs growth even as financial markets have all but priced out any rate hikes this year and as signs of stress in the global financial system have re-emerged amid volatile markets. The Fed Chair also is likely to find herself in heated exchanges with lawmakers over the bank\u2019s perceived secrecy, with presidential candidates from both sides of the aisle now taking regular shots at the Fed on the campaign trail. \u201cI think that markets probably have over-reacted to the sense that the Fed won\u2019t raise rates any time soon,\u201d said Vincent Reinhart, visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and former head of the Fed\u2019s monetary affairs division.  The House Financial Services Committee hearing is set for 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) on Wednesday, followed on Thursday at 10 a.m. EST by a Senate Banking Committee hearing. U.S. growth slowed to 0.7 percent rate in the fourth quarter as weak global demand weighed on the economy. But the housing sector strengthened, unemployment fell to 4.9 percent last month and, in a relief for the Fed, wages jumped in January by the most in a year. Vice Chair Stanley Fischer and other Fed officials have recently backed off predictions of about four rate hikes this year, noting that plunging oil prices mean U.S. inflation could take longer to rise to a 2 percent goal. But policymakers have stressed that it is too soon to scrap forecasts for continued U.S. strength in 2016. Some have noted that a similarly severe market selloff in August and September did not derail the economy as much as initially feared. \u201cSeptember is ... a case where there were tighter financial conditions, and they didn\u2019t last that long and then we moved off (zero rates),\u201d Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, a voter on Fed policy this year, said last week. The Fed overcame deep market skepticism that it would initiate a hiking cycle when it pulled off its first rate rise in almost a decade in December last year. At a twice-yearly appearances before Congress, the Fed chair is often peppered with barbed questions about the central bank\u2019s effectiveness, regulatory chops and commitment to congressionally set goals, both from Republicans like House Financial Services Chair Jeb Hensarling as well as Democrats like Elizabeth Warren, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee. Some of the top presidential candidates, including Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders, are calling for major reforms to the Fed.  All of that could complicate things for Yellen as she tries to keep alive the prospect of further rate rises even as she acknowledges the threat posed by a slowing global economy. \u201cWe must not forget, after all, that despite the financial market rout and the pain in the mining and manufacturing sector, the Fed has gotten closer to meeting both of its mandates,\u201d said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at Unicredit, after data on Tuesday showed job openings surged in December.

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton maintained her commanding lead in the race to win the Electoral College and claim the U.S. presidency, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project results released on Saturday. In the last week, there has been little movement. Clinton leads Donald Trump in most of the states that Trump would need should he have a chance to win the minimum 270 votes needed to win. According to the project, she has a better than 95 percent chance of winning, if the election was held this week. The mostly likely outcome would be 326 votes for Clinton to 212 for Trump. Trump came off his best debate performance of the campaign Wednesday evening but the polling consensus still showed Clinton winning the third and final face-off on prime-time TV. Trump disputes those findings. And some national polls had the race tightening a wee bit this week though others had Clinton maintaining her solid lead. But the project illustrates that the broader picture remains bleak for Trump with 17 days to go until the Nov. 8 election.  Trump did gain ground in South Carolina where his slim lead last week expanded to seven points, moving it into his column from a toss-up. Unfortunately for him, he lost ground in Arizona, which is now too close to call. Additionally, he is facing a challenge for Utah\u2019s six Electoral College votes from former CIA operative and Utah native Evan McMullin. The independent candidate is siphoning votes away from Trump in a state that is Republican as any in the nation. In some polls, McMullin is even leading. (The States of the Nation is not polling on McMullin.) Utah, like almost all of the states, is a winner-take-all contest. Clinton has also maintained a lead in Florida and Pennsylvania, which have a combined 49 Electoral College votes. Ohio remains too close to call. According to the project, lower voter turnout generally benefits Trump but his best hope for success is if Republican turnout surges and Democratic turnout is low. To examine these results and other scenarios, go to the States of the Nation project here . ",

        "text": "XIAMEN, China (Reuters) - China wants to put its relationship with India on the  right track , President Xi Jinping told Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, as the two countries sought to mend ties damaged by a recent tense Himalayan border standoff. The meeting was the first between the two leaders since Chinese and Indian troops ended a standoff in the Doklam border region about a week ago that was the neighbors  most serious military confrontation in decades. Talks between Xi and Modi had been in question before the  de-escalation, which came just in time for China to host the BRICS summit of emerging economies, which also includes Brazil, Russia and South Africa, in the southeastern city of Xiamen. Healthy, stable ties were in the  interests of both countries, Xi told Modi in a meeting on the sidelines of the summit, according to a statement from China s foreign ministry.  China is willing to work with India ... to increase political trust, advance mutually beneficial cooperation and promote the further development of China-India relations along the correct path,  Xi said.  China and India must maintain the fundamental determination that each other constitute mutual development opportunities and do not constitute a mutual threat,  Xi said, adding that peaceful, cooperative relations were the  only correct choice . Xi and Modi spoke for more than an hour and the discussions were  constructive , Indian Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told reporters in Xiamen after the meeting.  There was a sense that if the relationship is to go forward, then peace and tranquility on the border area should be maintained,  Jaishankar said, adding that both sides agreed that strong contacts between their defense personnel were needed to prevent another border incident.  On both sides there was a sense that more efforts need to be made to ensure that these kinds of situations don t reoccur.  Pressed on how the Doklam dispute was discussed, Jaishankar said,  Both of us know what happened. This was not a backwards looking conversation. This was a forward-looking conversation.   Hundreds of troops were deployed on the Doklam plateau, near the borders of India, its ally Bhutan, and China after New Delhi objected to China building a road through the mountainous area. The quiet diplomacy that ultimately ended in de-escalation was based on a principle of stopping  differences becoming disputes  that Modi and Xi had agreed at a June meeting in Astana, an Indian official has said. Still, China and India remain divided on many fronts, including India s deep suspicions of China s growing military activities in and around the Indian Ocean. For its part, Modi s government has upset China with its public embrace of Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama, whom the Chinese regard as a dangerous separatist, and growing military ties with the United States and Japan. China has said its forces will continue to patrol in Doklam, which is claimed by Bhutan, and that it hoped India had learned a lesson from the incident.    ",

        "title": "Vietnam reviews toll road after rare protests",
        "text": "HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam s government has promised a full review of charges at a toll gate on a new road after protests there posed a rare challenge to the Communist authorities and showed signs of spreading. Charges at the Cai Lay toll road in southern Vietnam were suspended by the government on Monday after protesting drivers caused long tailbacks by paying fees in bundles of tiny denomination bills. There is little tolerance of dissent in Vietnam and the government is acutely sensitive to any sign of public disaffection, particularly if it spreads on social media. In comments published on the government s website on Friday, Transport Minister Nguyen Van The said he was investigating alternative proposals for operating the toll road.  We will carry out our research and complete the report to the government,  he was quoted as saying.  Whichever option we choose for Cai Lay will have an impact on other BOT (Build Operate and Transfer) projects.  He dismissed accusations on social media that officials had benefited from connections to the company operating the toll gate. Vietnam is also in the midst of a crackdown on corruption. There are some 88 toll stations on Vietnamese roads set up by investors under BOT schemes to finance construction. But the one on the Cai Lay toll road caused anger when it opened in Aug. 1, because its location meant even drivers who were not going to use the new road had to pay. The investor said that was fair because it had also repaired the old road, but drivers pointed out those repairs cost very little. Charges were suspended when protests started after the toll gate first opened, but the toll booths reopened on Nov. 30. To protest, some drivers paid tolls of 25,000 ($1.10) to 140,000 dong using low-value notes   sometimes requiring the toll gates to count hundreds of bills for a single transaction. Similar protests then appeared on roads in other parts of the country, causing long hold-ups for traffic in one of Southeast Asia s fastest growing economies. Authorities needed handle the situation sensitively, said one Facebook user, who commented:  This could become a bigger problem if they shield each other against this legitimate protest by the people . The toll gate protest is one of the biggest public displays of anger in Vietnam since demonstrations in 2016 against a toxic spill from a steel plant and the slow government response to the marine environmental disaster it caused. The Vietnamese company that built the new road, National Highway No. 1 Tien Gang Investment Co. Ltd., told media that unhappy road users should understand that it was a business with workers and their families to support.   ",

        "title": "U.S. diplomats accuse Tillerson of breaking child soldiers law",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of about a dozen U.S. State Department officials have taken the unusual step of formally accusing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of violating a federal law designed to stop foreign militaries from enlisting child soldiers, according to internal documents reviewed by Reuters. A confidential State Department \u201cdissent\u201d memo, which Reuters was first to report on, said Tillerson breached the Child Soldiers Prevention Act when he decided in June to exclude Iraq, Myanmar, and Afghanistan from a U.S. list of offenders in the use of child soldiers. This was despite the department publicly acknowledging that children were being conscripted in those countries. [tmsnrt.rs/2jJ7pav] Keeping the countries off the annual list makes it easier to provide them with U.S. military assistance. Iraq and Afghanistan are close allies in the fight against Islamist militants, while Myanmar is an emerging ally to offset China\u2019s influence in Southeast Asia. Documents reviewed by Reuters also show Tillerson\u2019s decision was at odds with a unanimous recommendation by the heads of the State Department\u2019s regional bureaus overseeing embassies in the Middle East and Asia, the U.S. envoy on Afghanistan and Pakistan, the department\u2019s human rights office and its own in-house lawyers. [tmsnrt.rs/2Ah6tB4]    \u201cBeyond contravening U.S. law, this decision risks marring the credibility of a broad range of State Department reports and analyses and has weakened one of the U.S. government's primary diplomatic tools to deter governmental armed forces and government-supported armed groups from recruiting and using children in combat and support roles around the world,\u201d said the July 28 memo. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, questioned at length by reporters on the issue at her daily briefing, strongly defended Tillerson\u2019s decision as valid and in \u201ctechnical compliance with the law in the way he read it.\u201d \u201cNo one in the United States government likes the idea of the use of child soldiers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s abhorrent. Asked at a photo opportunity with the visiting Peruvian foreign minister about his decision, Tillerson sidestepped any direct response to the dissenting officials\u2019 complaint.  Reuters reported in June that Tillerson had disregarded internal recommendations on Iraq, Myanmar and Afghanistan. The new documents reveal the scale of the opposition in the State Department, including the rare use of what is known as the  \u201cdissent channel,\u201d which allows officials to object to policies without fear of reprisals. The views expressed by the U.S. officials illustrate ongoing tensions between career diplomats and the former chief of Exxon Mobil Corp appointed by President Donald Trump to pursue  an \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to diplomacy.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The child soldiers law passed in 2008 states that the U.S. government must be satisfied that no children under the age of 18 \u201care recruited, conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers\u201d for a country to be removed from the list. The statute extends specifically to government militaries and government-supported armed groups like militias. The list currently includes the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Mali, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.     In a written response to the dissent memo on Sept. 1, Tillerson adviser Brian Hook acknowledged that the three countries did use child soldiers. He said, however, it was necessary to distinguish between governments \u201cmaking little or no effort to correct their child soldier violations ... and those which are making sincere - if as yet incomplete - efforts.\u201d [tmsnrt.rs/2zWGRt0]Hook made clear that America\u2019s top diplomat used what he sees as his discretion to interpret the law. Foreign militaries on the list are prohibited from receiving aid, training and weapons from Washington unless the White House issues a waiver based on U.S. \u201cnational interest.\u201d In 2016, under the Obama administration, both Iraq and Myanmar, as well as others such as Nigeria and Somalia, received waivers.    At times, the human rights community chided President Barack Obama for being too willing to issue waivers and exemptions, especially for governments that had security ties with Washington, instead of sanctioning more of those countries. \u201cHuman Rights Watch frequently criticized President Barack Obama for giving too many countries waivers, but the law has made a real difference,\u201d Jo Becker, advocacy director for the group\u2019s children\u2019s rights division, wrote in June in a critique of Tillerson\u2019s decision. The dissenting U.S. officials stressed that Tillerson\u2019s decision to exclude Iraq, Afghanistan and Myanmar went a step further than the Obama administration\u2019s waiver policy by contravening the law and effectively easing pressure on the countries to eradicate the use of child soldiers. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The officials acknowledged in the documents reviewed by Reuters that those three countries had made progress. But in their reading of the law, they said that was not enough to be kept off a list that has been used to shame governments into completely eradicating the use of child soldiers. Ben Cardin, ranking Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Tillerson on Friday saying there were \u201cserious concerns that the State Department may not be complying\u201d with the law and that the secretary\u2019s decision \u201csent a powerful message to these countries that they were receiving a pass on their unconscionable actions.\u201d The memo was among a series of previously unreported documents sent this month to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department\u2019s independent inspector general\u2019s office that relate to allegations that Tillerson violated the child soldiers law. Legal scholars say that because of the executive branch\u2019s latitude in foreign policy there is little legal recourse to counter Tillerson\u2019s decision.    Herman Schwartz, a constitutional law professor at American University in Washington, said U.S. courts would be unlikely to accept any challenge to Tillerson\u2019s interpretation of the child soldiers law as allowing him to remove a country from the list on his own discretion.    The signatories to the document were largely senior policy experts with years of involvement in the issues, said an official familiar with the matter. Reuters saw a copy of the document that did not include the names of those who signed it.    Tillerson\u2019s decision to remove Iraq and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from the list and reject a recommendation by U.S. officials to add Afghanistan was announced in the release of the government\u2019s annual human trafficking report on June 27. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Six days earlier, a previously unreported memo emailed to Tillerson from a range of senior diplomats said the three countries violated the law based on evidence gathered by U.S. officials in 2016 and recommended that he approve them for the new list. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It noted that in Iraq, the United Nations and non-governmental organizations \u201creported that some Sunni tribal forces ... recruited and used persons younger than the age of 18, including instances of children taking a direct part in hostilities.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ali Kareem, who heads Iraq\u2019s High Committee for Human Rights, denied the country\u2019s military or state-backed militias use child soldiers. \u201cWe can say today with full confidence that we have a clean slate on child recruitment issues,\u201d he said.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The memo also said \u201ctwo confirmed cases of child recruitment\u201d by the Myanmar military \u201cwere documented during the reporting period.\u201d Human rights advocates have estimated that dozens of children are still conscripted there. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay challenged accusers to provide details of where and how child soldiers are being used. He noted that in the latest State Department report on human trafficking, \u201cthey already recognized (Myanmar) for reducing of child soldiers\u201d \u2013 though the report also made clear some children were still conscripted. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The memo said further there was \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that a government-supported militia in Afghanistan \u201crecruited and used a child,\u201d meeting the minimum threshold of a single confirmed case that the State Department had previously used as the legal basis for putting a country on the list. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Afghan defense and interior ministries both denied there were any child soldiers in Afghan national security forces, an assertion that contradicts the State Department\u2019s reports and human rights activists.

        "title": "Russia shrugs off Sessions uproar, says has daily contacts with U.S. partners",
        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian embassy to the United States said on Thursday it was in regular contact with \u201cU.S. partners\u201d after the Washington Post reported that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had failed to disclose meetings with Russia\u2019s ambassador. Citing Justice Department officials, the Post said Sessions spoke twice last year with Sergey Kislyak, Russia\u2019s ambassador, while he was still a U.S. senator. U.S. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday called on Sessions to resign over the issue. The question of how much contact there was between the campaign of President Donald Trump and Russia prior to his election has dominated the early days of his presidency along with allegations from U.S. intelligence officials that Moscow ran an influence campaign to try to sway the election\u2019s outcome.   Russia categorically denies meddling and Russian officials say the issue is being deliberately used by Trump\u2019s opponents to derail chances of a swift warming in U.S.-Russia ties. \u201cThe embassy doesn\u2019t comment on numerous contacts with local partners, which occur on a daily basis in line with diplomatic practice,\u201d Russian embassy spokesman Nikolai Lakhonin told Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency, when asked to comment on meetings between Sessions and Kislyak.   Sessions has denied discussing details of the U.S. presidential campaign with Russian officials. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was fired last month after he discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Kislyak before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia under Barack Obama who has himself met Kislyak, said he was bemused by what he said was the Trump administration\u2019s secrecy about its contacts with Russian officials. \u201cI just don\u2019t get why Trump folks are so secretive about meetings/calls with Russians. If nothing to hide, just tell the truth!,\u201d McFaul said on social media.  Alexey Pushkov, a Russian senator, said the uproar over Sessions showed how paranoid U.S. politicians had become about any links with his country. \u201cAlmost the entire U.S. elite is, it turns out, linked to Russia. Including the attorney general,\u201d Pushkov wrote on social media. \u201cParanoia knows no bounds.\u201d     ",

        "title": "Yemen's Saleh says ready for 'new page' with Saudi-led coalition",
        "text": "ADEN (Reuters) - Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said on Saturday he was ready for a  new page  in relations with the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen if it stopped attacks on his country. The call came as his supporters battled Houthi fighters for a fourth day in the capital Sanaa while both sides traded blame for a widening rift between allies that could affect the course of the civil war. Together they have fought the Saudi-led coalition which intervened in Yemen in 2015 aiming to restore the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after the Houthis forced him into exile. The clashes between Saleh s supporters and the Houthis underscore the complex situation in Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Middle East, where a proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed Hadi has caused one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes in recent times.  I call upon the brothers in neighboring states and the alliance to stop their aggression, lift the siege, open the airports and allow food aid and the saving of the wounded and we will turn a new page by virtue of our neighborliness,  Saleh said in a televised speech.  We will deal with them in a positive way and what happened to Yemen is enough,  he added. Saleh, who was forced to step down by a 2011 mass uprising against his 33 years in office, said Yemen s parliament, which is dominated by his GPC party, was the only legitimate power in the country and was ready for talks with the coalition. The Saudi-led coalition welcomed Saleh s change of stance. In a statement carried by the Saudi-owned Al-Hadath channel, the coalition said it was  confident of the will of the leaders and sons  of Saleh s General People s Congress (GPC) party to return to Arab fold.  The coalition accuses non-Arab Iran of trying to expand its influence into Arab countries, including Yemen, which shares a long border with Saudi Arabia, by aligning themselves with the Houthis and Saleh. The Houthis accused Saleh of betrayal, and vowed to keep up the fight against the Saudi-led coalition.  It is not strange or surprising that Saleh turns back on a partnership he never believed in,  the group s political bureau said in a statement.  The priority has been and still is to confront the forces of aggression.  Residents of Sanaa described heavy fighting on the streets of Hadda, a southern residential district of the Yemeni capital where many of Saleh s relatives live, early on Saturday, with sounds of explosions and gunfire heard while the streets were deserted.  The fighting eased in the afternoon as Saleh supporters gained the upper hand, but intermittent gunfire was being heard. There was no immediate word on casualties. Both sides have reported that at least 16 people were killed in the fighting, which began on Wednesday when armed Houthi fighters entered the main mosque complex, firing RPGs and grenades. Saleh s GPC party accused the Houthis of failing to honor a truce and said in a statement on its website that the Houthis bear responsibility for dragging the country into a civil war. It also called on supporters, including tribal fighters, to  defend themselves, their country, their revolution and their republic...  The GPC appealed to the army and security forces to remain neutral in the conflict. But the head of the Houthis  Ansarullah group warned that the biggest winner from what he described as Saleh s  sedition  was the Saudi-led coalition.  I appeal to the leader Saleh to show more wisdom and maturity... and not to heed incitement calls,  Abdel-Malek al-Houthi said in a speech on the group s Al-Masirah TV, adding that his group was ready to sit down for arbitration and abide by any ruling. Yemen s civil war has killed more than 10,000 people since 2015, displaced more than two million people, caused a cholera outbreak infecting nearly one million people and put the country on the brink of famine.

        "text": "BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania s senate approved on Wednesday part of a judicial overhaul criticized by the European Commission, the United States and the country s own president as a threat to judicial independence. The bill passed by the assembly is one of three that have triggered street protests across the country, a European Union state ranked as one of the bloc s most corrupt, and drawn opposition from thousands of magistrates.  The three bills jointly limit magistrates  independence and set up a special unit to probe crimes committed by magistrates. This makes magistrates the only professional category with a prosecuting unit dedicated to investigating them. The proposed changes mean the country is joining its eastern European peers Hungary and Poland, where populist leaders are also trying to control the judiciary, in defying EU concerns over the rule of law. Lawmakers approved another bill on Tuesday, amending the definition of prosecutor s activity to exclude the word  independent . A third bill is widely expected to be approved on Thursday. The Commission launched an unprecedented action on Poland on Wednesday, calling on other member states to prepare to sanction Warsaw if it fails to reverse judicial reforms it says pose a threat to democracy. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said there were  obvious risks  that the Commission could do the same in Romania s case if the legal changes take hold.  If someone imagines there will not be consequences, then they are from the moon,  Iohannis told reporters.  There will be consequences, the magnitude depends on the laws  final form.      It could be months before the bills are enforced. Opposition parties plan to challenge them in the Constitutional Court. The president could do the same, as well as send them back to parliament for re-examination, something he can do only once. He could also trigger a country-wide referendum on continuing the fight against corruption.  Romania s ruling Social Democrats, which command an overwhelming majority in parliament together with their junior coalition partner, ALDE, have so far ignored the warnings.  They are also working on changes to the criminal code that critics say will derail law and order. The country s prosecutor general, chief anti-corruption prosecutor and the head of the anti-organized crime unit have all criticized the proposed changes which they said will not only end the anti-graft fight but endanger general safety. Hundreds of magistrates protested in silence this week, lining the steps of courthouses across the country. Romania s anti-corruption prosecution unit has sent 72 members of parliament to trial since 2006. The speakers of parliament s lower house and senate are both currently on trial in separate cases. ",

        "title": "Comey had pushed for more resources for Russia probe before being fired by Trump: source",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey, days before President Donald Trump fired him, told lawmakers he sought more resources for his agency\u2019s probe into possible collusion between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia to sway the 2016 U.S. election, a congressional source said on Wednesday. With the Republican president facing a storm of criticism from many Democratic lawmakers and some in his own party, the Trump administration accused Comey of \u201catrocities\u201d on the job and denied his firing was related to the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation. Trump, who met Russia\u2019s foreign minister at the White House on Wednesday, lashed out at critics, calling Democrats \u201cphony hypocrites,\u201d and defended his decision to abruptly oust Comey on Tuesday from the law enforcement post he held since 2013. In a farewell letter to staff seen by CNN, Comey, who was appointed by Trump\u2019s predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama, said he had \u201clong believed that a president can fire an FBI director for any reason, or for no reason at all.\u201d Comey added he would not spend time dwelling on Trump\u2019s decision \u201cor the way it was executed.\u201d But Democrats ramped up accusations that Comey\u2019s removal was intended to undermine the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe and demanded an independent investigation into the alleged Russian meddling, with some calling the firing an attempt to cover up wrongdoing related to Russia. A congressional source with knowledge of the matter said Comey told lawmakers within the past few days he had asked the Justice Department to make additional resources available - mainly more staffing - for the Russia probe. Comey informed lawmakers of that request after the Senate Intelligence Committee, conducting its own investigation, had asked the FBI to speed up its Russia inquiry, the source said. Democrat Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s top Democrat, told reporters she understood Comey was seeking more resources for the FBI investigation. Responding to media reports that Comey had asked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week for a significant boost in resources for the agency\u2019s probe, Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior said in an email: \u201cTotally false.\u201d U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in a January report that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered an effort to disrupt the 2016 election that included hacking into Democratic Party emails and leaking them, with the aim of helping Trump. Russia has denied any such meddling. The Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia. Top U.S. Republicans rallied to Trump\u2019s defense, but some called the action troubling. Republican House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said in a statement on Wednesday he had requested a review by the Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general of Trump\u2019s decision to fire Comey, who had more than six years left in his 10-year post. Comey\u2019s dismissal stunned Washington and plunged Trump deeper into a controversy over his campaign\u2019s alleged ties with Russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency, while also threatening to hinder his policy goals. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t doing a good job, very simply,\u201d the Republican president said of Comey during a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the White House Oval Office. The administration said on Tuesday that Comey\u2019s firing stemmed from his handling of an election-year FBI probe into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. White House officials said Trump\u2019s anger at Comey had been building for months but a turning point came when the FBI chief refused to preview for top Trump aides his planned testimony to a May 3 Senate hearing on the Clinton email issue, an act Trump and his aides took it as an act of insubordination. Trump had been considering letting Comey go \u201csince the day he was elected\u201d in November, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. She referred to what she called Comey\u2019s \u201catrocities in circumventing the chain of command\u201d at the Justice Department. Many Democrats have criticized Comey\u2019s management of the Clinton investigation, but they questioned the timing of his dismissal, given that Trump could have acted soon after taking office on Jan. 20 and that he has repeatedly criticized the FBI and congressional probes into Russia\u2019s role in the election. In a flurry of Twitter posts, Trump said Comey had \u201clost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike.\u201d He added, \u201cDems have been complaining for months & months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved. Phony hypocrites!\u201d The Senate minority leader, Democrat Chuck Schumer, said Rosenstein should appoint a special prosecutor. Schumer called on Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to hold closed and potentially classified briefings with all senators to question the top Justice Department officials, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Rosenstein. \u201cWe know Director Comey was leading an investigation (into) whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians, a serious offense. Were those investigations getting too close to home for the president?\u201d Schumer said. McConnell accused Democrats of \u201ccomplaining about the removal of an FBI director who they themselves repeatedly and sharply criticized\u201d and said a special prosecutor would impede existing probes like one under way in the Senate Intelligence Committee. Paul Ryan, the Republican leader of the House of Representatives, told Fox News in an interview it was \u201centirely within the president\u2019s role and authority\u201d to remove Comey and that a special prosecutor was unnecessary. Mark Warner, the intelligence committee\u2019s top Democrat, said he and the panel\u2019s Republican chairman, Richard Burr, had asked Comey to testify before the panel in private next Tuesday. On Wednesday evening, the intelligence panel said it had issued a subpoena requesting documents from Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, in relation to its Russia probe. The committee said it had first requested the documents in a letter to Flynn on April 28. Flynn was forced to resign in February for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Trump said he had \u201ca very, very good meeting\u201d with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and they discussed Syria\u2019s civil war. Their meeting was the highest-level public contact between Trump and Putin\u2019s government since Trump took office.  During an earlier appearance at the State Department, Lavrov responded in a sarcastic tone when asked about Comey\u2019s dismissal, saying: \u201cWas he fired? You\u2019re kidding. You\u2019re kidding.\u201d In the Russian city of Sochi, Putin said Comey\u2019s firing would not have an impact on U.S.-Russian relations. Trump\u2019s nominee as the new FBI director would need to win Senate confirmation. Trump\u2019s possible choices to head the FBI on an interim basis, according to a White House official, include acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Assistant Director Paul Abbate, Chicago FBI agent Michael Anderson and Richmond, Virginia, agent Adam Lee.

        "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - France s hard-left CGT trade union called a third strike against President Emmanuel Macron s overhaul of employment laws on Monday but failed to get other unions to rally behind it. The three main unions have been divided over how to respond to the labor law reforms, with the Communist Party-rooted CGT taking to the streets while the more moderate CFDT, now France s biggest union, and the Force Ouvriere preferring negotiations.  France was once a champion of social protest, with unions able to paralyze swathes of the economy and force ministers to back down on reforms. But hardline unions are now grappling for relevance as strikes become less frequent and less disruptive.  Macron s government s spent weeks negotiating with the unions during the summer over measures to give companies more power to set working conditions as well as making it easier to hire and fire workers. Last month, it signed the bill into law by decree.  We are continuing with the fight against the labor law decrees,  Fabrice Angei, a senior CGT unionist, told reporters after a two-hour long meeting with the CFDT, FO and other unions. The CGT hopes it can win concessions for as long as the decrees are not physically written into the labor code. Up to now, the CFDT has said it will focus on other battles ahead such as reform of the pension and unemployment insurance systems.    Monday s meeting over labor reform action came on the eve of a separate nationwide strike by public sector workers. Strike notices have been lodged in schools, hospitals, airports and government ministries over plans to axe 120,000 jobs, freeze pay and reduce sick leave compensation.  It is the first time in a decade that all nine unions representing 5.4 million public workers have united behind a protest call and will be an important test of public appetite to protest against the reforms. If turnout is low on Tuesday, Macron could feel emboldened as he presses ahead with revamping France s generous unemployment insurance in a bid to spur those who lose their jobs to get back to work more quickly.

        "text": "FLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told residents of Flint, Michigan, on Thursday their \u201chorrific\u201d water contamination crisis should be a wake-up call about the country\u2019s crumbling infrastructure and required an emergency response. \u201cIf there is any silver lining out of this tragedy, it is my hope that the American people will look at Flint and say, \u2018never again,\u2019\u201d Sanders said on his first campaign visit to the city, where a cost-saving decision to switch the water supply has led to a public health crisis from lead contamination. \u201cWe are looking at children being poisoned - if that is not an emergency, I just don\u2019t know what an emergency is,\u201d Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, told about 300 people jammed into a Flint church for a meeting that at times featured a freewheeling exchange with shouting residents. Sanders, who has made his call for a $1 trillion investment in U.S. infrastructure a key part of his campaign agenda, said Flint\u2019s water crisis illustrated the need for a long-term commitment to rebuilding dilapidated water systems across the country. \u201cWhile Flint may be the canary in the coal mine, there are a lot of other canaries all around the country. The truth is our infrastructure is collapsing,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI hope that out of the tragedy will come fundamental changes.\u201d Sanders\u2019 Democratic campaign rival, Hillary Clinton, visited the predominantly black city weeks ago and frequently highlights the crisis as an example of racial inequity as the two candidates vie for African-American support. Sanders has called for the resignation of Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, and met recently with some Flint activists during a visit to Michigan. He told the Flint crowd that hearing their stories of suffering was \u201chorrific.\u201d \u201cClearly this is part of a long-term trend of starving communities of color,\u201d he said. The crisis was triggered when a city manager installed by Snyder switched the city\u2019s water supply from Lake Michigan to the nearby Flint River. The change corroded Flint\u2019s aging pipes and released lead and other toxins into the water supply. President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency in Flint in January, authorizing federal emergency management officials to coordinate relief efforts. Lawmakers in Congress have wrestled with the size of a federal funding package to replace aging pipes. Sanders and Clinton will return to Flint on March 6 for their next nationally televised debate ahead of the Michigan primary on March 8.

        "title": "U.S. Mideast intelligence analysts felt superiors distorted findings",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Officials in the U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, which oversees combat operations in the Middle East and South Asia, were much more likely than counterparts elsewhere to believe superiors  distorted or suppressed their analyses, according to a government intelligence survey.     Results of the December 2015 survey are likely to reinforce questions in Congress and elsewhere about whether the administration is pressuring officials to make over-optimistic claims about progress against Islamic State and the Taliban to help U.S. President Barack Obama leave office in January on a high note.     The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)     survey, which had not been reported until now, was one of the main topics of a House intelligence committee hearing on Thursday.     In one of its more striking findings, only 36 percent of  Central Command officials surveyed said they were confident that their mid- and senior-level managers were not deliberately distorting or suppressing their analyses. The average for the other eight U.S. military commands, which include those in the Pacific, Africa and Europe, was 72 percent. Central Command directs the American military missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and South Asia. Its analysts typically assess intelligence such as potential targets for bombing and an enemy\u2019s strength. Asked if \u201canyone attempted to distort or suppress analysis on which you were working in the face of persuasive evidence,\u201d 40 percent of the CENTCOM respondents said yes, compared to an average of 13 percent. The survey found that when that question was asked, 65 percent of the command\u2019s respondents said \u201cpoliticization\u201d was an issue.  \u201cThe data suggests respondents from Central Command believe their workplace adheres to objectivity standards relatively less than do workplaces of their IC counterparts,\u201d the report said, using an acronym for the U.S. intelligence community.  Outgoing Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said the situation at Central Command had improved in the 2016 survey. Clapper told a congressional intelligence hearing on Thursday that CENTCOM objectivity numbers were now similar to those in other combatant commands. \u201cI do think there is, by virtue of the change in commanders and...(there) has been a change in the atmosphere there and so I\u2019ve been encouraged by the trends particularly this year,\u201d Clapper said.  CENTCOM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Separately, Clapper told the hearing that he had submitted his letter of resignation but would stay until the end of the Obama administration. The survey has been conducted annually since 2006 and about 4,000 analysts and managers responded to it, including 125 CENTCOM analysts and managers. It cautions, however, that because responses were voluntary, \u201ccare should be taken when broadly interpreting results\u201d for each command.         Officials in other U.S. intelligence agencies said the Central Command issues were not the product of pressure from White House or other senior officials, and played a minor role in the administration\u2019s public claims of progress against Islamic State and the Taliban, many of which have proved to be overly optimistic. That is true, these officials said, because much of the Central Command analysis consists of daily bomb damage assessments and other situation reports, not strategic intelligence, and constitutes only a small part of the material that finds its way from numerous other intelligence agencies, including the CIA and the National Security Agency, into the President\u2019s daily intelligence briefing. Nevertheless, the findings of the survey, which was posted with no notice last month on a remote part of the ODNI website, are likely to raise questions about intelligence assessments provided by Central Command. Earlier this year, a U.S. congressional report said Central Command painted too rosy a picture of the fight against Islamic State in 2014 and 2015 compared with the reality on the ground and grimmer assessments by other analysts.       The Defense Department Inspector General is investigating the findings and is expected to issue a separate report, military officials said.     ",

Mansae!  the people call as they parade past the 33-year old, who stands on a balcony above them:  Live long!  This December, Kim will mark six years in power. In that time he has purged or executed around 340 people, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank of South Korea s National Intelligence Service (NIS). The people on parade carry flowers including North Korea s national blooms, Kimilsungia and Kimjongilia, which were specially created in honor of Kim s grandfather and father, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. North Korea is the only socialist country to have passed power down the family line. Images of former presidents are pinned on the left side of every jacket and dress. They are worn there to be close to the wearers  hearts. In private conversations, some North Koreans quietly lament the shortcomings of their system: It s too bureaucratic, takes too long to get things done, is disorganized, they say. But few dare to openly criticize the Supreme Leader. North Korea s GDP per capita, estimated at $1,700 in the CIA Factbook, places it 215th in the world   it is poorer than Haiti, Zimbabwe and Afghanistan. Defectors say many North Koreans lead double lives, earning money in unofficial market places to supplement state incomes. The leadership turns a blind eye to this. Traditionally, Pyongyang has been the home of North Korea s elites. But the inhabitants of the capital must also prepare for the parades. Around this time, everyone everywhere must increase production in a process known as a  battle.  People, organized into work units, are assigned duties on top of their usual jobs. The  70-day battle  ahead of a Party congress in 2016 meant long after-work hours sprucing up the capital. State media released a report: Some work units had delivered 110 percent of their quotas. The fatigue shows in some flower-wavers  faces.  On June 1, 2016, the country announced that a new campaign of celebration was to be held. This time, it said, the battle would last 200 days.  ",

        "title": "Republican House Speaker Ryan backs Trump after long courtship",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Ryan, the top elected Republican, ended a long period of soul-searching and endorsed Donald Trump for president on Thursday, a step toward unifying party loyalists behind the insurgent candidate despite concerns about his candidacy. Ryan had been a high-profile holdout to supporting Trump for the Nov. 8 presidential election out of concern about the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s bellicose rhetoric and break with party orthodoxy on issues including trade and immigration. The House of Representatives speaker announced his support in a column for the Janesville Gazette newspaper in his home state of Wisconsin. It surfaced in the middle of a speech by Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in which she launched a far-reaching attack on Trump\u2019s foreign policy credentials. Ryan did not specifically use the word \u201cendorse\u201d in his column, but his spokesman, Brendan Buck, made clear that Ryan\u2019s move should be seen as an endorsement. The speaker had criticized the Republican candidate several times, including Trump\u2019s proposal in December to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States because of national security concerns. The 46-year-old Ryan was the only member of the Republican congressional leadership who had not formally embraced Trump. In a tweet, Trump responded: \u201cSo great to have the endorsement and support of Paul Ryan. We will both be working very hard to Make America Great Again!\u201d Ryan\u2019s backing of Trump could give cover to more reluctant Republicans to get behind the billionaire businessman as their best chance to win the White House. \u201cI think the endorsement is significant because it shows the falling in line of the establishment Republicans from the top,\u201d said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. It should also help Trump make the case that he can bring the party together as he girds for a Republican nominating convention in July that many party leaders plan to skip. It also represents a blow to Republicans who have been trying to organize a third-party bid to give party loyalists who cannot abide Trump someone else to support. The \u201cnever Trump\u201d crowd includes 2012 nominee Mitt Romney. Ryan was Romney\u2019s vice presidential running mate. While Ryan\u2019s decision could push some Republican leaders off the fence, many holdouts remained, such as two former rivals, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Aides to both said their positions had not changed. Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid described Ryan\u2019s move as \u201cabject surrender,\u201d adding: \u201cThe GOP is Trump\u2019s party now.\u201d Ryan met Trump in a high-profile meeting last month and they have since had a number of telephone calls. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that he and I have our differences. I won\u2019t pretend otherwise,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cAnd when I feel the need to, I\u2019ll continue to speak my mind. But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement.\u201d Ryan said he and Trump had spoken many times in recent weeks about how, \u201cby focusing on issues that unite Republicans, we can work together to heal the fissures developed through the primary.\u201d \u201cThrough these conversations, I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people\u2019s lives. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll be voting for him this fall,\u201d Ryan said. Announcing he will vote for Trump should make it a bit more comfortable for Ryan to chair the party\u2019s nominating convention in Cleveland. While Ryan\u2019s endorsement was significant for Trump, there remain many concerns about him within the party. Longtime Republican financier Fred Malek drew attention to worries about Trump in a column in the Washington Post on Thursday. He cited Trump\u2019s criticism last week of New Mexico\u2019s Republican governor, Susana Martinez, considered a rising star in the party with the ability to appeal to Hispanics. \u201cThese attacks on fellow Republicans must stop as we move closer to the general election,\u201d Malek wrote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, who has said he will support Trump, told CNN that Trump\u2019s proposed Muslim ban was a bad idea and that his criticism of Martinez was ill-advised. Ryan said he too still had concerns about Trump\u2019s tone. \u201cIt is my hope the campaign improves its tone as we go forward and it\u2019s all a campaign we can be proud of,\u201d Ryan told the Associated Press.

        "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian police have arrested two Hindu farmers in connection with the killing of a Muslim man suspected of smuggling cows to a slaughter house, the investigating officer said on Wednesday. Hardline Hindu groups have gained prominence since Prime Minister Narendra Modi s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in 2014, and the protection of cows, considered holy by many in the Hindu-majority country, is a priority for them. Police found the body of Ummar Khan, 35 on Friday on railway tracks in Alwar district, in the northwestern state of Rajasthan. The two suspects were detained on Monday and arrested the next day, said Rahul Prakash, the top police officer in Alwar.  It is a clear case of murder over the issue of cow protection and we have also found that the victim was running a cow-smuggling racket,  Prakash said. Khan and two accomplices were using a stolen vehicle to transport five cows when they were attacked by six members of a self-styled cow protection force, he said.  Both sides were carrying guns and were shooting at each other.  Khan was shot dead and his body was thrown onto the railway track, Prakash said. Cow slaughter is illegal in most of India.  Gau rakshaks , or cow vigilantes, run a loosely organized movement that they say is meant to prevent cattle smuggling, with tactics that include highway ambushes. Modi has called for more to be done to prevent such attacks on people accused of eating beef or slaughtering cows. This year, a Muslim farmer died from injuries sustained during an assault by a mob in Alwar, about 180 km (100 miles) southwest of New Delhi, when he was taking cows to his home. Khan s wife, Khurdisan, denied that her husband and been leading any cows to slaughter. She accused members of a right-wing Hindu group affiliated to Modi s party of the murder.  He was bringing the cows home for their milk, not for their meat. I want the government to protect me and my children,  she was quoted as saying by Hindi-language Rajasthan Patrika newspaper. ",

The measure passed by 99-0. It passed the House of Representatives nearly unanimously in November, and congressional aides said they expected Obama would sign it. The ISA will expire on Dec. 31 if not renewed. The White House had not pushed for an extension, but had not raised serious objections. Members of Congress and administration officials said the renewal of the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) would not violate the nuclear agreement with Iran reached last year. \u201cWhile we do not think that an extension of ISA is necessary, we do not believe that a clean extension would be a violation of the JCPOA (Iran deal),\u201d a senior administration official said. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said recently the extension would breach the agreement and threatened retaliation. Democrats who backed the accord said they did not believe the ISA extension violated the pact because it continued a sanctions regime that was already in place. They said they had not heard such objections from U.S. partners. \u201cI have not heard strident objections from our key allies in the JCPOA,\u201d Democratic Senator Chris Coons told reporters. The agreement was signed by the United States, Britain, Russia, France, China, Germany and Iran. Congress\u2019 action did not address the fate of the nuclear pact, which was opposed by every Republican in the Senate and House. Lawmakers said it would make it easier for sanctions to be quickly reimposed if Iran violated the deal. Republican U.S. President-elect Donald Trump railed against the pact as he campaigned for the White House. Many other members of his party, which also controls Congress, have called for the new administration to tear up the agreement. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said the renewal ensures Trump can reimpose sanctions Obama lifted under the deal, in which Iran curbed its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. \u201cExtending the Iran Sanctions Act ... ensures President-elect Trump and his administration have the tools necessary to push back against the regime\u2019s hostile actions,\u201d Corker said in a statement. Trump becomes president on Jan. 20. Corker has been mentioned as a possible Trump secretary of state. (Fixes typo in word \u201cobjections\u201d in paragraph 8.) ",

        "title": "China tightens control of chat groups ahead of party congress",
        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China issued new rules on instant messaging chat groups on Thursday, tightening control over online discussions ahead of a sensitive leadership reshuffle next month. Beijing has been ramping up measures to secure the internet and maintain strict censorship, a process that has accelerated ahead of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party, when global attention will be on the world s No.2 economy. Group chats on instant messaging apps and online commenting threads have seen a surge in popularity in China in recent years as forums for discussion, partly because they are private for members and so in theory are subject to less censorship. Internet chat service providers must now verify the identities of their users and keep a blog of group chats for no less than six months, the Cyberspace Administration of China said in a statement released on its website  The rules, which take effect on Oct 8, just before the congress is due to begin, will cover platforms provided by China s internet titans, such as Tencent s WeChat and QQ, Baidu s Tieba and Alibaba s Alipay chat.  The regulations also require companies to establish a credit system, and to provide group chat services to users in accordance to their credit rating, CAC said. Chat group participants who break the rules will see their credit scores lowered, their rights to manage group chats suspended or revoked and should be reported to the relevant government department, it added. The CAC did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment sent after office hours on Thursday.     The administration also said the owner of the chat group should bear responsibility for the management of the group.  Whoever owns the group should be responsible, and whoever manages the group should be responsible,  it said. The new rules are the latest requirement for China s internet giants, who have already been subject to investigations from the CAC into their top social media sites for failing to comply with cyber laws.  The administration has already taken down popular celebrity gossip social media accounts and extended restrictions on what news can be produced and distributed by online platforms, and has embarked on a campaign to remove virtual private network apps, which allow users to access websites blocked by the authorities.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House plans to ask the U.S. Congress for a third round of disaster aid in mid-November as the costs continue to pour in for helping rebuild after hurricanes, but Budget Director Mick Mulvaney has told lawmakers he wants to see spending cuts elsewhere. Mulvaney said the federal government is assessing how much it will cost to help Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands rebuild after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria caused massive damages in August and September. Mulvaney expects the damages to add up to \u201cseveral tens of billions of dollars,\u201d he said in a letter to Senate Leader Mitch McConnell dated Tuesday. \u201cAs we move toward the longer-term issue of rebuilding the impacted areas of our nation, we believe that it is appropriate that the Congress consider reducing spending elsewhere in order to offset what will, again, be a significant amount of unbudgeted spending,\u201d Mulvaney said in the letter. President Donald Trump is slated to receive a briefing on hurricane recovery efforts later on Wednesday in Dallas, where he is attending fundraising events. The Office of Management and Budget has drawn up a preliminary list of more than $5.5 billion in unspent funds that could be cut, Mulvaney said in a separate letter to lawmakers on Senate and House appropriations committees. The list includes $4.3 billion from an Energy Department loan program for advanced technology vehicle manufacturing and almost $730 million in funds no longer needed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for projects related to Hurricane Sandy recovery, Mulvaney said.

        "title": "\"It would be huge\": U.S. border town confronts possible import tax",
        "text": "NOGALES, Arizona (Reuters) - For up to 16 hours a day, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and mangoes grown in Mexico flow north through a border checkpoint into Nogales, Arizona, helping to ensure a year-round supply of fresh produce across the United States. This is a city built on cross-border trade.    Each year, some 330,000 trucks and 75,000 train cars carrying $17 billion worth of goods move through Nogales, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Economists estimate trade supports nearly one in three jobs here, ranging from workers who inspect the goods to forklift operators who unload them in distribution centers.    In many ways, Nogales represents the flip side of free trade deals that have battered industrial cities in the Midwest, where jobs have been outsourced and manufacturing plants shut down. The cities where Donald Trump\u2019s promise to throttle what he calls unfair competition resonated most profoundly during the presidential campaign. It also represents potential risks that new trade barriers could pose for businesses and residents along the border. Only a tall, rusted fence separates Nogales, Arizona, from Nogales, Mexico; the cities are so intertwined that locals call them by a single name, \u201cAmbos Nogales\u201d or \u201cBoth Nogales.\u201d  Now in office, Trump is considering a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico, one of several ideas under review in Washington, and is promising to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. More than a dozen city officials, employers and workers interviewed here said a border tax, if enacted, could choke the flow of imports from Mexico. They described a chain of events that would harm the economy, threaten local jobs and lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. \u201cPresident Trump should take a good look at the effects of whatever he does, because he\u2019s going to end up with a real problem,\u201d said Nogales Mayor John Doyle, who joined other lawmakers from Arizona, New Mexico and Texas in denouncing the  import tax plan in letters to U.S. lawmakers.      Food, autos and electronics go both ways across the border checkpoint, sometimes more than once. Mexican mangoes and melons come north while California almonds and apples from Washington state go south. U.S. car parts sent to Mexican factories are imported back as finished vehicles. \u201cThere are hundreds of products that come back and forth through the port of entry in Nogales,\u201d Doyle said.        The Trump administration told Reuters that any tax deal would protect U.S. interests.      \u201cThe American people can rest assured that any policy President Trump pursues will be designed to increase wages for American workers, reduce the U.S. trade deficit, and strengthen the economy so that it works for all,\u201d a White House official said in an email. Since the 1994 implementation of NAFTA, trade between Mexico and the United States has risen more than six fold. Each country exported about $40 billion to the other in 1993. Last year the United States imported $294 billion in goods from Mexico and exported $231 billion back, U.S. Census data show.     Nationwide, nearly 5 million jobs are now tied to trade with Mexico, from importers to jobs dependent on low-cost goods, according to a study by the non-partisan Wilson Center\u2019s Mexico Institute.     In Santa Cruz County, surrounding Nogales, the produce import industry and supporting businesses account for more than 22 percent of jobs, according to a 2013 report by economists at the University of Arizona. Trade and support for factories across the border account for another 10 percent of the workforce.      The report\u2019s lead author, Vera Pavlakovich-Kochi, said a 20 percent border tax would create the strictest barriers to trade in five decades. In addition to Trump\u2019s proposal of a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico, Republican lawmakers have put forth a plan that would cut corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20 percent tax on imports. The proposals have split Corporate America.  A group of major exporters including Boeing Co, General Electric Co and Pfizer Inc have formed a coalition to support the import tax. At the same time, large retailers, including Target Corp and Best Buy Co Inc, have countered that such a tax would raise consumer prices and hurt their businesses. Seated in his second-floor office in a warehouse nestled in the rolling hills on the outskirts of town, produce trader Jaime Chamberlain said business with Mexico is the lifeblood of Nogales, which brings in more pounds of Mexican produce than any other U.S. border town. It\u2019s \u201cone of the largest industries here with the most employment and the most to lose,\u201d said Chamberlain, a board member of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas. He voted for Trump and his pro-business, socially conservative agendas, but is lobbying state leaders to oppose the tax. Chamberlain\u2019s parents began the family business with a $1,000 loan in 1971. He and his sister now own J-C Distributing Inc, which employs about 25 people who handle 120,000 pounds of Mexican tomatoes each week for Taco Bell in addition to orders for major companies such as Kroger Co and Sysco Corp.     The company warehouse is among more than six dozen such facilities on Interstate 19, just a few miles north of Nogales\u2019 town square. In all, they bring in fruits and vegetables worth $3.3 billion a year, according to the Fresh Produce Association.      Local officials, residents and economists warn that a tax could reverberate across the local economy. For example, a 20 percent border tax could put some of the $17 million in produce trade-related fees on custom brokerage, freight forwarding and truck permits at risk.  \u201cThere are a lot of unintended consequences with this,\u201d said Santa Cruz Board of Supervisors Chairman Manuel Ruiz. \u201cThere are domino effects all over. \u201d     Many local business people expect Mexico to fight back.     \u201cA 20 percent tax could start a trade war with Mexico. I don\u2019t see how we can impose that unilaterally,\u201d said Ricardo Crisantes, vice president of marketing and sales at Wholesum Harvest, which is part of a Mexico-based company that has offices in Nogales and organic farms on both sides of the border.     Company representatives said a border tax could drive the company to shift more farming to the United States, but it also could send import demand to other parts of Latin America that would bypass Nogales.      Restaurant and store owners say the tax would make already tough times even worse.        \u201cIt would be huge,\u201d said Karla Galindo, 35, who owns Rancho Grande restaurant in Nogales with her husband.       She and other local business owners said sales have already been hurt by the war of words between officials in Mexico and the United States. \u201cPeople are afraid to spend their money,\u201d Galindo said.

        "title": "Haitians in U.S. malign Trump decision to send them back home",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Haitian immigrants on Tuesday decried a U.S. decision to end a program that granted 59,000 Haitians temporary visas after the 2010 earthquake, saying they would be sent back to a country that has yet to recover from that disaster and others since. The United States offered Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, to Haitians after the January 2010 earthquake killed some 300,000 people and devastated a country that has long been the poorest in the Americas. The administration of former President Barack Obama  extended the program several times, finding that conditions in Haiti were too dire to send the beneficiaries home. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, after previously granting a six-month extension, announced on Monday that it would end TPS for Haiti in July 2019. Any Haitian who cannot obtain another kind of U.S. visa will be subject to deportation back to the Caribbean nation, where some earthquake victims are still homeless and the country is wobbling from Hurricane Matthew, a cholera outbreak and political instability.    \u201cWe\u2019re just left in a void,\u201d said Sebastian Joseph, 26, a Haitian immigrant living in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn   where Haitians and other Caribbeans are concentrated. He said virtually all Haitians want to stay in the United States, where they have carved out a niche in construction and healthcare services such as caring for the elderly and sick. \u201cAmerica has been the home of the free for 200 years or more. Everybody wants to come to America,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cA lot of people will go back to nothing.\u201d    Trump\u2019s supporters note that the visa program was always meant to be temporary and that Trump ran a 2016 presidential campaign promising restrictive immigration policies. At least one Haitian TPS recipient in Brooklyn accepted that eventually she must return. \u201cIf they say I have 18 months and that\u2019s it, I say thank God, and then I will go,\u201d said Margaret Etienne, who gave birth to a 3-year-old son here who is now a U.S. citizen. \u201cIt\u2019s my country. I love my country,\u201d she said after buying takeout from a Haitian restaurant with her son on a stretch of Church Avenue that is also called Bob Marley Boulevard, after the late Jamaican musician. In ending the TPS designation, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke said she had determined that the \u201cextraordinary but temporary conditions caused by the 2010 earthquake no longer exist.\u201d Some critics dispute that Haiti has recovered and question how Duke reached such a conclusion. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, the state with the most Haitians, urged Trump to extend TPS, warning in a column he wrote for the Miami Herald that \u201cHaitians sent home will face dire conditions, including lack of housing, inadequate health services and low prospects for employment.\u201d Fifty-nine percent of Haiti\u2019s population lives below the poverty line of $2.41 per day, according to the World Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be good for me. I don\u2019t know what I would do,\u201d said Ives Joseph Laforgue, 63, an unemployed Haitian immigrant in Flatbush who said he had open-heart surgery in 2014 and lives off the charity of Brooklyn\u2019s Haitian community. Still, he said he would have even less in Haiti. Haitian community leaders and pro-immigration politicians in New York on Tuesday pledged to pressure the Trump administration to extend TPS. Among them was U.S. Representative Nydia Velazquez, a Democrat who introduced legislation that would protect from deportation immigrants who have TPS and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED), another program subject to presidential discretion that was extended by Obama but is due to expire in March 2018. Ricot Dupuy, station manager of Radio Soleil, a Haitian-themed broadcaster in New York, said he thinks the decision is racially motivated.  \u201cThis pressure to send immigrants back home ... The idea is to whiten America,\u201d Dupuy said from his Brooklyn studio.  \u201cThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is not stupid. They know that TPS holders, it\u2019s good for this country. The business community knows it\u2019s good for them. And eventually they may have the last word.\u201d ",

        "text": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish musician and activist Bob Geldof called Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi  a hand maiden to genocide  on Monday as he returned his Freedom of the City of Dublin award in protest over his fellow recipient s response to the repression of Rohingya Muslims.  I don t want to be on a very select roll of wonderful people with a killer,  Geldof told state broadcaster RTE.      Someone who is at best a handmaiden to genocide and an accomplice to murder.   More than 600,000 Muslims from Myanmar s Rakhine state have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh after military operations described by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing. Their plight has drawn outrage around the world. But Suu Kyi, long seen as a champion of human rights, has been criticized for failing to speak out against violence. There have been calls for her to be stripped of the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991. Suu Kyi was given the Freedom of Dublin in 1999 while she    was held under house arrest by Mayanmar s then military government. She received her award at a reception in Ireland in 2012, two years after her release.  Her association with our city shames us all and we should have no truck with it, even by default. We honored her, now she appals and shames us,  Geldof said in a statement.  The Lord Mayor of Dublin, Micheal Mac Donncha, said the city council had discussed taking away the honor and the matter was still under review. Last month she was stripped of a similar honor by the British university city of Oxford, where she was an undergraduate.  But Mac Donncha, a councillor for the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party, also criticized Geldof s gesture, saying it was ironic as Geldof held a British knighthood despite  the shameful record of British imperialism across the globe .  The former Boomtown Rats singer was given an honorary knighted in 1986 in recognition of his charity work, including organizing the 1985 Live Aid concert to help those suffering from starvation and disease in Ethiopia. Other foreign recipients of the Freedom of Dublin include John F. Kennedy, Nelson Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev. Irish rockers U2, who had campaigned for Suu Kyi s release while she was a political prisoner, also voiced disappointment and said her silence was  starting to look a lot like assent .  Who could have predicted that if more than 600,000 people were fleeing from a brutal army for fear of their lives, the woman who many of us believed would have the clearest and loudest voice on the crisis would go quiet,  the band said in a statement.  For these atrocities against the Rohingya people to be happening on her watch blows our minds and breaks our hearts.  The Myanmar military says it launched the crackdown in response to attacks by Rohingya militants. ",

        "text": " WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to use existing funds to begin immediate construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border has hit a financial roadblock, according to a document seen by Reuters.  The rapid start of construction, promised throughout Trump\u2019s campaign and in an executive order issued in January on border security, was to be financed, according to the White House, with \u201cexisting funds and resources\u201d of the Department of Homeland Security.  But so far, the DHS has identified only $20 million that can be re-directed to the multi-billion-dollar project, according to a document prepared by the agency and distributed to congressional budget staff last week.  The document said the funds would be enough to cover a handful of contracts for wall prototypes, but not enough to begin construction of an actual barrier. This means that for the wall to move forward, the White House will need to convince Congress to appropriate funds.

An internal report, previously reported by Reuters, estimated that fully walling off or fencing the entire southern border would cost $21.6 billion - $9.3 million per mile of fence and $17.8 million per mile of wall.  DHS officials did not respond to a request for comment on this story.  Trump has said he will ask Congress to pay for what existing funds cannot cover and that Mexico will be pressured to pay back U.S. taxpayers at a later date.  Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he will include funding for a border wall in the budget for next fiscal year. He has estimated the cost to be between $12 billion and $15 billion.  Many Republican lawmakers have said they would vote against a plan that does not offset the cost of the wall with spending cuts.  In the document it submitted to Congress, the DHS said it would reallocate $5 million from a fence project in Naco, Arizona, that came in under budget and $15 million from a project to install cameras on top of trucks at the border.  The surveillance project was awarded to Virginia-based Tactical Micro, but was held up due to protests from other contractors, according to the DHS document. Tactical Micro could not be reached for comment.  The DHS only searched for extra funds within its $376 million budget for border security fencing, infrastructure and technology, so it would not have to ask for congressional approval to repurpose funding, according to the document.  Contractors cannot begin bidding to develop prototypes until March 6 but more than 265 businesses already have listed themselves as \u201cinterested parties\u201d on a government web site.  Those interested range from small businesses to large government contractors such as Raytheon (RTN.N).  ",

        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico and Central American countries they will lobby U.S. lawmakers to protect young illegal immigrants who saw their lives thrown into limbo on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would end a program that shields them from deportation.  Trump announced plans to halt the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that has protected from deportation nearly 800,000 young men and women who entered the United States illegally as children. Mexico s deputy foreign minister, Carlos Sada, said Trump s decision created  anxiety, anguish and fear  for the roughly 625,000 Mexican nationals protected under the program.  They are exceptional. ... This is as emotional for the United States as for Mexico,  Sada said at a news conference immediately following the announcement to end the program.  He said his government would press U.S. lawmakers for a quick solution to the uncertainty that  Dreamers,  as they are commonly called, now face in their adopted home. Immigrants who opt to return to Mexico will be welcomed with  open arms,  Sada said, offering them assistance with work, finances and education. The announcement to end DACA, created by former President Barack Obama in a 2012 executive order, came during the final day of talks in the Mexican capital to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, adding pressure to already tense conversations between Mexico and the United States. El Salvador s foreign relations minister, Hugo Martinez, said he would meet with U.S. Congress members to find a solution within the next six months, before DACA s provisions are set to end, aiming to protect the 30,000 to 60,000 Salvadorans who could be affected.  It s a worrisome situation. ... We will be lobbying to have legislation as soon as possible that opens a way out,  Martinez said. Guatemala s foreign relations ministry said in a statement that it is counting on the  humanitarian sensibilities  of U.S. lawmakers to ensure thousands of Guatemalans are not forced to leave the country where many grew up. Honduras said in a statement that it would push U.S. Congress to reconsider Trump s move, and offer consular support for more than 18,500 Hondurans protected by DACA. The director of a Honduras migrant aid center, the Center for Attention for Honduran Migrants, called the U.S. decision  very sad,  and said young Hondurans forced to return home could face violence from gangs and drug traffickers.  Their lives will be much more difficult and put at enormous risk,  said Valdette Willeman, the center s director. (For graphic on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, click tmsnrt.rs/2wC83sF) ",

        "title": "Struggling to govern, Trump faces growing Republican unease",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As fellow Republicans labored to repeal Obamacare this week, U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly swerved off-topic, escalating concerns in his party about his ability to govern the country six months after taking office. While senators grappled with healthcare, Trump banned transgender people from the military. He regaled a Boy Scout jamboree with a tale from a New York cocktail party. He indulged an obscene tirade by his flamboyant new communications director. In the end, the Senate\u2019s efforts collapsed in a predawn vote on Friday, magnifying the ineffectiveness that often goes with the chaos around Trump, the constant storm of tweets, the White House infighting, the self-inflicted wounds. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing clear evidence that all of these distractions are standing in the way of their ability to achieve legislative accomplishments,\u201d said Republican strategist Alice Stewart, a top aide to Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign last year. In the latest twist, Trump late on Friday named U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly as his new White House chief of staff, replacing Reince Priebus, who has been in a feud with Trump\u2019s new communications director Anthony Scaramucci. Among some establishment Republicans, there were signs that patience with Trump was wearing thin. His national security team, seen as a bedrock of normality, increasingly is frustrated. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were described by sources as unhappy with their handling by the White House. Defense Secretary James Mattis was coming to grips with Trump\u2019s abrupt decision on Wednesday, via a tweet, to ban transgender individuals from military service. The Pentagon  said it would not execute the order without more guidance. Republican strategist Charlie Black said Trump needs to let an investigation of possible ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign run its course and not keep talking about it. Russia denies meddling, and Trump denies any collusion. The Russia probe has fed public spats with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, quarreling among aides and attacks on Robert Mueller, the special counsel running the investigation. \u201cHe should be talking about policy and sticking to issues for a while,\u201d Black said. \u201cThere are still some good things that could get done in Congress like tax reform. He can help further those things if that\u2019s what he talks about.\u201d In the Senate healthcare fight, Trump phoned Republican senators and urged them to support repeal of Obamacare, but the effort fizzled, a sign there was little political retribution to fear from a president with a sub-40 percent approval rating. A moderate House Republican said Trump let down the Obamacare rollback effort by not going out and selling a plan. For Trump, a businessman and former reality TV show host, the presidency is his first elected office. \u201cThis issue was outsourced to Congress. It was never really sold. I think that was part of the reason why it was a failure,\u201d said Republican Representative Charlie Dent. As the Senate fight was coming to a head, Washington was suddenly mesmerized by a profanity-laced rant from Scaramucci, who tore into Priebus and Trump strategist Steve Bannon in an interview in The New Yorker magazine. Stunned aides stopped what they were doing to read the article online. The rant has so far gone unpunished. Inside the White House, there was a sense of genuine concern and bewilderment about what Scaramucci\u2019s future might portend. Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said the tensions did not seem to trouble Trump. \u201cThe president\u2019s management style seems to be to encourage factionalism among people below him. He seems to place value on watching people fight,\u201d Fleischer said. Aside from sacking Priebus, it was unclear how Trump planned to proceed to regain his footing. With healthcare stalled, Trump has his sights set on tax reform with no consensus on how to proceed. Top aides are split on how deeply to cut taxes. It is the same moderates-versus-conservatives split that doomed the Obamacare rollback. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Banking Committee\u2019s top Democrat tussled with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during a hearing on Thursday over the flow of information from his agency, and later asked if President Donald Trump, a Republican, had ordered him to restrain communications with Democrats. \u201cAre you aware of any White House guidance formal or informal urging administration officials not to respond to or to delay in responding to Democratic senators?\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, a liberal Democrat, asked Mnuchin toward the end of the hearing. \u201cI am not,\u201d Mnuchin answered. Brown said earlier in the hearing that he had written to Mnuchin on March 2 asking about \u201cpotential conflicts of interest and ownership in the administration,\u201d but did not receive a response. He then pressed Mnuchin to send the committee \u201ca complete list of Trump business associates and financial ties.\u201d  Mnuchin said that before the hearing he had checked that Treasury staff \u201chad fully responded to all the inquiries from you and the committee\u201d and asked Brown to send a note reminding him to deliver the list. While other senators began questioning Mnuchin, the two took the argument off-line, with Treasury emailing reporters a brief statement saying that it had responded to Brown\u2019s letter on March 31. Brown\u2019s office then circulated the response it had received, which generally discussed compliance with conflict of interest laws and lacked any details. Brown\u2019s office said Treasury\u2019s brief letter had not answered his questions. The senator also did not seem reassured that Treasury was not dragging its feet in communicating with Democrats. After he asked about possible guidance from the White House, Brown pressed: \u201cWill you commit to responding to...members of both parties of this committee in a timely manner to all requests for information?\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d Mnuchin responded.

        "title": "After political storm, Indonesia president faces economic clouds",
        "text": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - During the first months of this year, President Joko Widodo was an embattled leader grappling with Indonesia s most serious political and religious tensions in two decades. Now, he has come through the storm looking stronger than ever. His popularity is near record highs and, thanks to deft maneuvers against foes trying to exploit a blasphemy case against one of his allies, Widodo has stamped his authority on the ruling coalition, parliament and the security forces. The quietly spoken former furniture salesman may have proved his political mettle, but his next challenge is an economy that refuses to respond to conventional policies to fire up growth. That could dent his re-election chances in 2019, especially with a budget that won t stretch to lavish government spending. Senior government officials worry that Widodo has been distracted by the battles with political opponents and taken his eye off the economy.  We are suffering from bad policy right now ... if we don t fix it or we don t regain the initiative I could easily see GDP growth going down, and is that a risk you want to take?  said one senior government official, who asked not to be identified. According to a June survey, nearly 60 percent of people polled were satisfied with Widodo s performance, almost an all-time high. But the poll also showed high expectations that he would deliver on promises to revive the lackluster economy.  If he doesn t perform on the economy, that would give ammunition to the opposition to challenge Jokowi in 2019,  said Djayadi Hanan of the Saiful Mujani Research Center, a Jakarta-based pollster, using the president s nickname. Indonesia s GDP growth has shambled at around 5 percent for the past two years, too low to lift the country out of the middle-income trap, largely because domestic consumption - once the engine of the economy - and bank lending have been sluggish. An unexpected cut in interest rates last month highlighted the struggle to lift growth despite government initiatives, including a tax amnesty program, an infrastructure drive, and a series of regulatory tweaks designed to make business easier. The government has little fiscal room to breathe life into the economy: the budget deficit is already close to a legally mandated ceiling of 3 percent of GDP and parliament could impeach Widodo if he allowed the deficit to run past that limit. David Sumual, chief economist at Indonesia s Bank Central Asia, said a hike in electricity tariffs and slow disbursement of subsidies to farmers have weakened the purchasing power of middle- to lower-income households. Meanwhile, higher-income groups are worried that the government is pushing for aggressive tax reform that will leave them less well off.  The problem now is confidence in the prospect of the economy. People don t want to spend,  Sumual said. In his state-of-the-nation address last month, Widodo pledged to tackle income inequality by cutting red tape and making land acquisition easier to accelerate infrastructure projects. And last week he urged his cabinet to focus on attracting investment to boost growth and create jobs. But two officials who spoke to Reuters said they worried he was not matching his rhetoric with bold steps that need to be taken now for growth to be marching higher next year, when campaigning for the 2019 presidential election will begin. On the to-do list remains finding a way to rein in the overbearing dominance of state-owned enterprises on the economy, which was singled out by the World Bank in July as something preventing private funds flowing in. In addition, there is a need to speed up efforts to tackle a tortuous regulatory and licensing regime to lift investment, an area where Widodo said last week, during the launch of a new policy package,  there s so much we have to improve, so much to fix . Just months ago, Widodo appeared to be fighting for his political survival as political opponents joined forces with radical Islamist groups to foment popular fury over alleged blasphemous comments made by Widodo s ally Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the former Christian governor of Jakarta. Amid massive protests in central Jakarta, there were rumors of treason plots and even a military takeover.  Beating the drum of Indonesia s  unity in diversity  motto, Widodo embarked on a frenzy of public appearances at military barracks, the homes of both political rivals and allies, and at moderate Islamic boarding schools - all aimed at projecting an image of unity and control.  He has been busy in the past six to eight months fighting back against destabilizing forces,  said Endy Bayuni, editor-in-chief of the most widely read English daily, the Jakarta Post.  He s showed that he is very much in control of the situation and has become even more mature as a politician.  Widodo s latest move to regain political authority took aim at hardline Islamist groups. By executive decree, he banned Hizb-ut Tahrir, a group that calls for Indonesia to be ruled by Islamic sharia law, saying its ambitions ran counter to the country s secular ideology. Such political dominance could provide Widodo with a false sense of security, the senior government official said.  The dark side of the story is ... the economy,  he said.  I think the biggest threat now, potentially   and it s the flip side of the incredibly strong political position he is in   would be complacency.  ",

        "title": "Lebanon emerges from crisis with Iran on top, but risks remain",
        "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran s allies in Lebanon have emerged even stronger from a crisis triggered by Saudi Arabia, which achieved little more than to force the Saudis  main Lebanese ally - Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri - closer to Tehran s friends in Beirut.    Saudi Arabia aimed to hurt Iran in Lebanon by forcing Hariri s resignation on Nov. 4 and torpedoing his coalition deal with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies, using its influence over the Sunni leader to cause trouble for the Shi ite group. Instead, the move backfired as Western states censured Riyadh over a step they feared would destabilize Lebanon, despite their shared concerns over the regional role of the heavily armed Hezbollah. Hariri revoked his resignation on Tuesday, drawing a line under the crisis caused by his announcement from Riyadh. Lebanese officials say he was put under house arrest before French intervention led to his return home. Riyadh and Hariri deny this. But while the crisis has abated, its causes - Hezbollah s growing military influence in the region and Saudi Arabia s determination to counter Iran - seem likely to bring more trouble Lebanon s way sooner or later. Hariri has identified possible Gulf Arab sanctions as a major risk to the Lebanese economy. Analysts also see a risk of another war with Hezbollah s old foe, Israel, which is alarmed by the group s strength in Lebanon and Syria. The episode also leaves big questions over Lebanese politics, long influenced by Saudi Arabia, a patron of the Lebanese Sunni community. One senior Lebanese politician said the experience had  left a big scar  on Hariri, once the  the spiritual son of Saudi Arabia .  After this, it will not be easy to have a normal relationship again.  Meeting on Tuesday for the first time since the resignation, Hariri s government indirectly acknowledged Saudi concerns over Hezbollah s role outside Lebanon. At Hariri s behest, it reaffirmed its policy of staying out of Arab conflicts. A top Lebanese official said Western pressure forced Saudi Arabia to retreat from its Lebanon plan but further Saudi moves could not be ruled out:  Can we restrain Saudi from going toward madness? In my view, no.  A Western diplomat said Saudi measures targeting the Lebanese economy were  a genuine possibility  at some point though the international community would likely try to influence how tough any sanctions would be.   I think the Saudis have understood from the international reaction that Lebanon isn t a pitch on which they are playing alone. There are other players who have interests who don t want to see those undermined,  the diplomat said.  At the same time, the international community s patience isn t unlimited. It will be hard to protect Lebanon indefinitely if there is no tangible progress on rolling back Hezbollah.  Hezbollah was the only group allowed to keep its weapons at the end of Lebanon s 1975-90 civil war to fight Israeli forces occupying southern Lebanon. Its militia has been a source of controversy in Lebanon since the Israeli withdrawal of 2000. With Saudi backing, Hariri led a Lebanese political alliance to confront the group, but that resulted in Hezbollah s takeover of Beirut in 2008 during a brief civil war. Hezbollah s stature has grown in the chaos that swept the Arab world after 2011. It has backed President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and helped in the war against Islamic State in Iraq.     But its role in the Yemen conflict is seen as the main factor behind the crisis in Lebanon. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran and Hezbollah of military support for the Iranian-allied Houthis in their war with a Saudi-led coalition. Hariri has repeatedly flagged Yemen as the cause of the latest crisis, and warned that Lebanon s economy is at stake. The economy depends on remittances from expat workers, particularly in the Gulf. Any threat to inflows is seen as a risk to the system that finances the heavily indebted state. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has appeared to recalibrate his rhetoric in response to the crisis. Last month, he denied his group was fighting in Yemen, or sending weapons to the Houthis, or firing rockets at Saudi Arabia from Yemeni territory. He also indicated Hezbollah could pull its fighters from Iraq. The remarks on the eve of Hariri s return were seen as  appeasing , a source close to Hariri said. Hariri has twice led coalition governments including Hezbollah despite his enmity toward the group: five Hezbollah members have been charged by a U.N.-backed tribunal with the 2005 assassination of his father, Rafik al-Hariri. Hezbollah denies any involvement. Hariri s willingness to compromise with Hezbollah was a factor behind the Saudi move against him and has drawn criticism from within the Sunni community. His status as Lebanon s most influential Sunni will be put to the test in parliamentary elections next year. Ashraf Rifi, a hawkish Sunni politician, said the way Hariri reversed his resignation was a  farce  and a  surrender to the Hezbollah project . The senior politician, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Hezbollah may offer Hariri a  gesture  over its regional role but saw little prospect of the group fundamentally changing course. President Michel Aoun, a political ally of Hezbollah, could pressure the group  a little bit to be cooler on certain issues , the politician said. But Lebanese in Saudi Arabia still had reason to be afraid for their livelihoods:  I think with time the Lebanese will try to disentangle themselves from Saudi Arabia, but this will cost Lebanon a lot because revenues will be reduced.  The Hariri crisis marked an unprecedented intervention in Lebanon, even in a country with a long history of foreign meddling. It also underlined the different priorities of Saudi Arabia and its Western allies in Lebanon - a major recipient of aid to help it host 1.5 million Syrian refugees. On the last day of Hariri s stay in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman summoned him for a meeting and kept him waiting for hours, delaying his departure for France where President Emanuel Macron was waiting for him, the senior politician and a top Lebanese official said.  Macron was calling Saad to find out where he was,  said the senior politician, adding that Macron then called Crown Prince Mohammad to tell him he was expecting Hariri for lunch. Western states want stability in Lebanon, the politician said.  They need Lebanon as a platform for observing the Arab world. They have invested a lot here, and if there is a civil war, (there is the question of) what to do with all the Syrian refugees.  ",

        "title": "Do not expect postcard-sized tax return from Republican plan: experts",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Since mid-2016, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has carried around a  postcard  that he has said shows how easy it will be for Americans to file their taxes once Republicans are finished their tax overhaul. And as recently as Thursday President Donald Trump touted Americans being able to  file their taxes on a single, little beautiful sheet of paper.      With lawmakers finalizing the biggest tax reform in 30 years and the president ready to sign it into law before the end of the year, the moment should be near when Ryan s postcard stops being a rhetorical prop and becomes a reality. Right?  It s kind of crazy to say you can file on a postcard when, first, no one is going to put their Social Security number on a postcard. And second, you already have a giant postcard in the form of the 1040EZ,  Mark Mazur, a director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said, citing a 14-line Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax form. Representatives from the $11 billion U.S. tax preparation industry said that the legislation so far seemed unlikely to render their services unnecessary.  I don t think you re going to have millions of people filing their taxes on a cell phone,  said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc [JAKHT.UL].  I think the demise of the tax business is a bit premature.  The IRS would not discuss changes that might come from the proposed tax overhaul. However, the IRS estimates that, despite its efforts to make filing taxes easier, 90 percent of Americans use tax preparation services such as Jackson Hewitt, H&R Block Inc and Liberty Tax Inc or tax software such as TurboTax from Intuit Inc.     If Congress enacts the Republican plan into law, it would not affect 2017 tax-year returns filed in 2018. But in 2019,  millions of middle-class Americans would no longer gain from a wide range of deductions, credits and other tax breaks. A key driver of this, according to independent analyses, would be a proposed doubling of the standard deduction and a curtailment of the deduction for state and local tax payments. In combination, these two changes would mean that about 29 million people would no longer benefit from itemizing. So they would stop writing off their charitable donations, mortgage interest and state and local tax payments, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a think tank. Itemized deductions for medical expenses, investment interest, unreimbursed employee expenses and tax preparation fees could also be dropped by many.  Personal exemptions for individual taxpayers, which now take up a lot of space on tax forms, would also be eliminated.  Such changes would mean simpler taxes and possibly allow a number of taxpayers to use shorter forms. The IRS expects 24 million people in 2018 to file the longest and most widely used IRS form today, the Form 1040, which is 79 lines long. About 4.6 million people will use the 14-line 1040EZ.

        "title": "China says no intention of using currency devaluation to its advantage",
        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Friday it had no intention of using currency devaluation to its advantage in trade, responding to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s description of the Asian giant as the \u201cgrand champions\u201d of currency manipulation. Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday he had not \u201cheld back\u201d in his assessment that China manipulates its yuan currency, just hours after his new treasury secretary pledged a more methodical approach to analysing Beijing\u2019s foreign exchange practices. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he hoped the United States could \u201cfully and correctly\u201d view the exchange rate issue. \u201cChina has no intention of seeking foreign trade advantages via an intentional devaluation of the renminbi. There is no basis for the continued devaluation of the renminbi,\u201d he told a daily media briefing in Beijing. \u201cIf you must attach the label \u2018grand champion\u2019 to China, then I think China is a grand champion. But we are the grand champions of economic development,\u201d Geng added. The Foreign Ministry has no say in currency policy, but it is the only Chinese government department that holds a daily briefing that foreign reporters attend. The central People\u2019s Bank of China did not respond to a request for comment. In a commentary, the official Xinhua news agency said criticising China for manipulating its currency to prop up trade was a \u201cmajor myth that has been circulating in Washington for quite a long time\u201d. \u201cSince July 2005, China has decided to unpeg the yuan against the U.S. dollar, and allow it to fluctuate against a basket of currencies so as to better reflect the market changes. Over the years, the renminbi has appreciated substantially against the dollar,\u201d it said. Trump has frequently accused China of keeping its currency artificially low against the dollar to make Chinese exports cheaper, \u201cstealing\u201d American manufacturing jobs. But he did not act on a campaign promise to declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. The yuan fell 6.6 percent against the dollar in 2016, its biggest annual drop since 1994, as it was pressured by worries about slowing Chinese growth and more recently by a resurgent dollar, which has spurred capital outflows from many emerging markets. Chinese authorities have taken numerous steps in recent months to curb capital flight to support the weakening yuan currency, while trying to bring in more foreign investment. Geng said there was no basis for the continued devaluation of the Chinese currency and he hoped \u201cthe relevant side can fully and correctly view the renminbi exchange rate issue\u201d.  But China\u2019s foreign exchange regulator said this month the  economy still faced weak global demand and financial market volatility caused by expectations of further interest rate rises by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

(Reuters) - A state judge in North Carolina gave residents in counties hit hard by Hurricane Matthew five extra days to register to vote after Democrats sued to get an extension to Friday\u2019s deadline, while a federal judge ordered an extension in one Georgia county. The Democratic Party in North Carolina challenged the state election board\u2019s refusal to extend the cutoff date, saying in its suit that thousands of people would have been deprived of their fundamental right to vote in the Nov. 8 election if Friday\u2019s deadline was not extended by at least five days.  The judge ordered an extension to next Wednesday in 36 counties, a lawyer for the state Democratic Party said on Twitter. \u201cThis ruling will ensure that those communities who have suffered from the devastating flooding brought on by Hurricane Matthew have the grace period that they need in order to exercise their right to vote and make their voices heard in this critical election,\u201d party officials said. Twenty-four people have died in North Carolina and thousands have been forced from their homes in the eastern and central parts of the state due to record flooding in Matthew\u2019s aftermath.  North Carolina is a battleground state in the presidential election and could play a pivotal role in the race between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. State officials said this week they would not extend the regular deadline to register to vote, but allowances would be made for forms delayed by mail delivery. Those who miss the deadline can still register and vote on the same day during the statewide early voting period from Oct. 20 through Nov. 5. The state has a Republican governor, Pat McCrory, who faces a tough contest for re-election. The state\u2019s Republican Party opposed any extension. \u201cIt is clear that North Carolina Democrats, who have been dominated in voter registration by Republicans, want to use a horrific natural disaster to change the rules in the middle of the game,\u201d state Republican Chairman Robin Hayes said in a statement. In Georgia, U.S. District Judge William Moore ordered the voter registration deadline extended until Tuesday in Chatham County, which includes the city of Savannah. The judge said the administrative difficulties of doing so \u201cpale in comparison to the physical, emotional and financial strain Chatham County residents faced in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew.\u201d A federal judge on Wednesday gave residents in Florida six extra days to register to vote after that state\u2019s Democratic Party sued for more time due to Matthew.

        "title": "Trump would try to squeeze Mexico into funding border wall",
        "text": "WASHINGTON - Donald Trump proposed on Tuesday forcing Mexico to pay for his planned border wall by threatening to block remittances from illegal immigrants, which he said amounts to \u201cwelfare\u201d for poor families in Mexico that their government does not provide. The Republican presidential candidate\u2019s campaign said in a memo that if elected in November, Trump would use a U.S. anti-terrorism law to cut off such money transfers unless Mexico made a one-time payment of $5 billion to $10 billion for the wall. Trump\u2019s pledge to build the wall has been a much-touted highlight of a platform targeting illegal immigration in the United States that has helped make him the front-runner to be the Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 election.  It is unclear how much a wall along the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) U.S.-Mexico border would cost, and Mexico has been adamant it would not pay. The memo elaborated on an idea Trump floated in August, when he suggested seizing all remittances tied to \u201cillegal wages.\u201d It said that upon taking office a Trump administration would propose a rule mandating companies such as Western Union Co WU.N to require customers to prove they were legally in the United States. If Mexico agreed to fund the wall, Trump would drop the proposed rule, it said. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy decision for Mexico,\u201d his campaign said, adding the country receives about $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexicans in the United States, most of them in the country illegally. \u201cIt (remittances) serves as de facto welfare for poor families in Mexico. There is no significant social safety net provided by the state in Mexico,\u201d it said.  According to the World Bank Remittances project, flows from the U.S. to Mexico in 2014, the last full year for which it has data, were nearly $24 billion although it is unclear what portion comes from Mexicans living in the country illegally. Democratic President Barack Obama called the remittance-blocking idea impractical and possibly self-defeating. \u201cThe notion that we\u2019re going to track every Western Union bit of money that\u2019s being sent to Mexico, you know, good luck with that,\u201d he told reporters. If Mexico\u2019s economy collapses, it would just drive more immigrants to the United States, Obama added.  Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto appeared to dismiss the proposal as campaign rhetoric. \u201cThe (Mexican) Presidency has no comment on any opinion made in the heat of the electoral process to choose candidates for the U.S. presidency,\u201d the president\u2019s office said in a text message to Reuters.  Any move to target payments sent home by people living in the United States could have a crushing financial effect in Mexico, the leading recipient of U.S. remittances.  Trump\u2019s proposal could also affect banks and companies that handle wire transfers, which also include MoneyGram International Inc (MGI.O) and PayPal Holdings Inc\u2019s (PYPL.O) Xoom.  The companies did not respond to requests for comment. In addition to his wall proposal, Trump has accused Mexico of sending rapists and drug runners to the United States. Democrats and many Republicans have repeatedly condemned his comments as inflammatory, but his remarks have been enthusiastically received by his supporters, especially by white working-class voters. In the memo, first reported by The Washington Post, Trump\u2019s campaign repeated its pledge to target visas. It also cited imposing trade tariffs or enforcing existing trade rules as a way of forcing Mexico to pay. Trump supporter Benjamin Proto, a Connecticut lawyer, acknowledged the remittance plan was unrealistic but praised the candidate for \u201clooking at different ways to do things.\u201d The memo emerged as Republican candidate Ted Cruz appeared set to beat Trump in Wisconsin\u2019s primary contest on Tuesday, a win he would hope would mark him as the best alternative to the New York billionaire.

        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday ruled that Illinois was not providing sufficient resources for the care of developmentally disabled residents and ordered the state to come up with a plan to restore services. U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman said Illinois, which just ended an unprecedented budget impasse, failed to provide \u201cresources of sufficient quality, scope, and variety\u201d to the residents, who as a result \u201csuffered substantially\u201d from a reduction in services in violation of a federal consent decree. In the ruling, Johnson said she lacked the authority to order a funding increase, noted the state\u2019s \u201cdire financial condition,\u201d and directed Illinois to devise a plan to address issues affecting the services and comply with the decree. The state had argued that advocates for the disabled living outside of institutions were seeking as much as an additional $1 billion annually - an amount Illinois could not afford. A two-year budget impasse that ballooned the state\u2019s unpaid bill backlog to more than $15 billion ended in July when lawmakers enacted a fiscal 2018 budget over the governor\u2019s vetoes. That budget allocates $53.4 million for the first rate increase for developmentally disabled services since 2008. But the advocates said the funding boost was insufficient to retain workers and services. \u201cWhat (the state) comes up with will be the next step,\u201d said Barry Taylor, vice president at Equip for Equality, one of the advocates, in a phone call. The judge set a status hearing for Oct. 27. Meghan Powers, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Human Services, said in an email that the state was committed to providing quality services to the developmentally disabled.  \u201cThe state will continue to meet all its legal obligations and will review the court\u2019s rulings to determine appropriate next steps,\u201d she said. Another U.S. judge ordered Illinois in June to substantially boost its monthly payments to Medicaid providers to ensure continued health care for poor and disabled residents covered under a separate federal consent decree.

        "title": "In stinging attack, France's Macron says Poland isolating itself in Europe",
        "text": "VARNA, Bulgaria/WARSAW (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday Poland was isolating itself within the European Union and Polish citizens  deserve better  than a government at odds with the bloc s democratic values and economic reform plans.   Macron said Warsaw, where a nationalist, eurosceptic government took office in 2015, was moving in the opposite direction to Europe on numerous issues and would not be able to dictate the path of Europe s future. Poland rejected the accusations, saying Macron was inexperienced and arrogant.  Europe is a region created on the basis of values, a relationship with democracy and public freedoms which Poland is today in conflict with,  Macron said in Bulgaria on the third leg of a trip to central and eastern Europe to generate support for his vision of a Europe that better protects its citizens.  He described Poland s refusal to change its stance on a revision of the EU s directive on  posted  workers - cheap labor from eastern countries posted temporarily to more affluent western countries - as a mistake. Macron has said the practice leads to unfair competition.  In no way will the decision by a country that has decided to isolate itself in the workings of Europe jeopardize the finding of an ambitious compromise,  he said.   In a scathing attack that could drag relations between western EU powers and the European Commission in Brussels on one side and Poland s Law and Justice Party (PiS) government on the other to a new low, he said the Polish people deserved better.  Poland is not defining Europe s future today and nor will it define the Europe of tomorrow,  Macron said at a joint press conference with Bulgarian President Rumen Radev in the Black Sea resort city of Varna. In response, Poland s Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said Macron, 39, a former investment banker elected in May as France s youngest president, lacked political experience and accused him of undermining the EU.  I advise the president that he should be more conciliatory ... Perhaps his arrogant comments are a result of a lack of (political) experience,  Szydlo said in a statement emailed to Reuters.  I advise the president that he should focus on the affairs of his own country. Perhaps he may be able to achieve the same economic results and the same level of security for (French) citizens as those guaranteed by Poland.  Her comments were an indirect reference to her government s insistence that it will not accept migrants from the Middle East, despite pressure from Brussels, because it believes they pose a threat to national security. France has been hit hard by deadly Islamist militant attacks in recent years. The Polish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had urgently summoned the French charg  d affaires to express  the Polish government s indignation about the arrogant words  of Macron. It quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Marek Magierowski as saying Poland  expects that France will abandon language that is divisive and which damages the unity of the EU .  Relations between Szydlo s Law and Justice (PiS) party and the French government deteriorated soon after it won election in late 2015. In October 2016, Poland abruptly canceled a nearly $4 billion military procurement deal with Airbus. Macron s election deepened the rift, with the French globalization advocate fanning worries in Warsaw that his vision of a  multi-speed  Europe would undermine Polish influence within the European Union. French officials have expressed concerns about Poland, and Hungary, drifting towards authoritarianism and said Macron would also make a defense of the rule of law and democratic principles one of the priorities of his mandate on the European stage.  On his three-day tour Macron sought backing for his plans to tighten EU rules on the employment abroad of labor from low-pay nations. Poland strongly opposes this initiative. While  posted  workers comprise less than 1 percent of the EU work force, it is a political hot potato that has exacerbated the divide between the bloc s poor east and rich west for years. Macron managed to enlist the broad support of Czech Republic and Slovakia, and the lukewarm backing of Romania, all countries which fear being sidelined in a multi-speed EU, whereas Poland and Hungary remain defiant of what they see as an out-of-touch EU elite based in Brussels and Western capitals. Poland is at loggerheads with the European Commission, the Brussels-based EU executive, over issues ranging from its refusal to accept EU migrant relocation quotas to the ruling conservatives  tightening grip on the judiciary and media.  Macron shunned both Poland and Hungary on his trip through the region.  He said he wanted Bulgaria - like Poland, Hungary, Romania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia a former communist state that joined the EU much later than western counterparts - to be at the negotiating table on European integration. On the posted worker rules, Bulgaria s Radev said the EU needed to balance the interests of countries in the rich west and the poor east.  It is important that changes are made in a way that unites rather than divides Europe,  he said.  Current EU rules allow workers to be posted from low-salary countries to other EU states on contracts that must guarantee the host country s minimum wage, but under which taxes and social charges are paid in the home nation.  Poland and Hungary say increased restrictions on such contracts would flout the principles of the European single market and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. ",

        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Trade negotiators from Canada, the United States and Mexico presented more proposals for a renewed North American Free Trade Agreement on Friday and tried to put behind them threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to pull out of the treaty.  Teams from the three countries kicked off a second round of talks in Mexico City on 25 areas of closed-door discussion, with subjects such as digital commerce and small businesses seen as areas where consensus was possible, officials said. The teams did not debate details, according to officials, but one union leader present said that U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had indicated he favored North American content of more than 70 percent in autos built in the NAFTA region. Taking up where they left off in Washington talks two weeks ago, the delegations were showing each other proposed language for reworking the accord, without yet seeking to thrash out mutually acceptable compromises, officials present told Reuters. Trump s multiple attacks on NAFTA in the build-up to the Mexico City round were seen by Mexican and Canadian officials as a ploy to wring concessions, but they have heightened uncertainty over the accord. Away from the diplomatic noise, the Mexico talks are expected to help define the priorities of each nation rather than yield major advances. Nevertheless, Trump s warnings have Mexico preparing for something hard to imagine even a few months ago - life without the agreement that boosted trilateral trade to around $1 trillion annually from $290 billion in 1993. The Sept. 1-5 talks will touch on some thorny topics such as rules governing local content in products made in North America, Mexico s economy ministry said in a statement. Substantial discussion of such areas is unlikely in either this round or the next one, a source familiar with the process said.  We do not expect any major breakthroughs or major developments in this round. We really don t,  one official familiar with the negotiating process said. Mexican officials believe Trump wants to include rules that a certain amount of content must be made in the United States. The head of Unifor, Canada s largest private sector union, Jerry Dias, told reporters he had suggested in a recent meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Ross that the NAFTA content level for autos be raised to 70 percent from the current 62.5 percent. But Ross, he said, had proposed a  more aggressive  level. Hundreds of small farmers and union members including speakers from Canada gathered outside the Mexican Congress on Friday to demand that NAFTA be reworked to truly help workers. Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke by phone on Thursday and stressed they wanted to reach a NAFTA deal by the end of 2017, the White House said. An accord by year end that significantly changes NAFTA is seen as unlikely. The goal is for an agreement before Mexico s 2018 presidential campaign starts in earnest. Officials fear the campaign will politicize talks, with nationalist frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador already recommending a tougher line from Mexico. Nevertheless, one Mexican official noted that Trump s repeated threats put pressure on his negotiators, forcing them to adopt tougher positions  than they would like,  while another official said they were ready to leave the table if needed. Trump said this week he might trigger a 180-day countdown to withdraw from NAFTA while the talks were ongoing to help meet his goals, which include sharply reducing a $64 billion annual U.S. trade deficit with Mexico. NAFTA, first implemented in 1994, eliminates most tariffs on trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico.  Critics say it has drawn jobs from the United States and Canada to Mexico, where workers are paid far lower wages. Supporters say it has created U.S. jobs, and that the loss of manufacturing from the United States has more to do with China than Mexico. If NAFTA collapses, costs could rise for hundreds of billions of dollars of trade as tariffs are brought back. Free-trade lobby groups say consumers would be saddled with higher prices and less availability of products ranging from avocados and berries to heavy trucks.    Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo and Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray told officials in Washington on Wednesday that Mexico would walk away from the negotiations if Trump pulls the trigger on withdrawing from the deal.  Juan Pablo Castanon, president of Mexico s Business Coordination Council representing the private sector in the talks, said the country was refining a  Plan B  that could be up and running within three months of an eventual NAFTA collapse. Talking on Mexican television, he said the plan included striking new trade arrangements in Asia and Latin America, sourcing alternate suppliers such as Brazil for grains now imported from the United States, and finding ways to recreate investor guarantees that are included in NAFTA.

        "title": "France gets serious over sexual harassment after Weinstein scandal: minister",
        "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - The Harvey Weinstein scandal is forcing a rethink of attitudes toward sexual harassment in France, a country that cherishes its self-image as the land of seduction and romance, said the minister tasked with cracking down on violence against women. Movie producer Weinstein has been accused by numerous women of having sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s, including three who said they were raped. Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone. More than 300,000 accounts of sexual harassment or abuse have been published under the French #balancetonporc or #squealonyourpig hashtag on Twitter in the past week, though some conservatives say the new trend amounts to an attack on the French way of life in the name of U.S.-style puritanism.  We are really at a turning point, with the Weinstein affair as a trigger,  Gender Equality Minister Marlene Schiappa told Reuters on Friday in an interview. France has often debated sexual harassment over the past decade following scandals involving French politicians. Six years ago, a sex scandal forced former French finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn to resign as head of the International Monetary Fund, provoking a round of soul-searching in France about sexual abuse that goes undeclared or undetected in the upper echelons of power. A deputy of Macron s year-old Republic on the Move party (LREM), Christophe Arend, was accused by his ex-assistant and campaign manager of sexual harassment, the Franceinfo media outlet reported on Friday. The party said in a statement that Arend benefitted from a presumption of innocence until proven otherwise and that he had filed a complaint of  slanderous denunciation  against his accuser.  Any form of violence and harassment is intolerable. It is up to the justice (process) and it alone to shed light,  LREM said. Gender Equality Minister Schiappa said the Weinstein scandal could have a more durable impact in France because it had prompted women from all walks of life to denounce harassment and assault at work and in public places, not only in the corridors of power.  When it s about politicians, most people just slam politicians rather than seeing it as a wider issue,  said Schiappa, a 34-year-old blogger-turned-minister in President Emmanuel Macron s new government.  But when it s to do with cinema it has a wider impact, because ... people identify with actors and actresses,  she added, describing the wave of testimonies on social media as a  liberation . This week Schiappa kicked off nationwide consultations over a law due to be completed early next year that will include steps to fight sexual harassment on the streets as well as extend the statute of limitation for rape of minors. Not all French people approve of her plans or of the  #squealonyourpig trend on Twitter.  France is a country of men who love women  wrote pundits Berenice Levet and Guillaume Bigot in Le Figaro daily on Thursday.  It is not a country of Platonic love,  they said, warning against the import of what French conservatives have long denigrated as a killjoy  Anglo-Saxon  view of relationships between men and women. Responding to such criticism, Schioppa said:  There is some reluctance, some say we will kill the culture of the  French lover ... if we punish street harassment.   But it s the opposite. We want to preserve seduction, chivalry and  l amour   la francaise  by saying what is key is consent. Between consenting adults everything is allowed, we can seduce, talk, but if someone says  no , it s  no  and it s final,  she said. Much of the French debate focuses on plans to slap fines on harassment in the street and whether that is really feasible. Schiappa acknowledged it was hard to define, adding details would be decided through wide consultations in coming months.  For instance it s following a woman through several blocks or asking for her phone number 15 straight times,  said Schiappa, adding that she personally did not believe wolf-whistles should be characterized as sexual harassment.

        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is running for re-election in March, has proposed writing off some of the tax debts accumulated by Russian individuals and small businesses. A total of about 80 billion roubles ($1.4 billion) would be written off under Putin s proposal, a high-ranking official told Reuters. Speaking at his annual news conference, Putin said that some of the debt accumulated because of flaws in Russia s tax system.  I think that people should be freed from these payments, and it should be done in the most de-bureaucratic way, without the need to apply to a tax inspection,  he added. He estimated that debts of 42 million people worth 41 billion roubles should be written off. The high-ranking official told Reuters that Putin was speaking about debts for property tax and penalties accrued before 2015 that the tax service recognizes as uncollectible. The debts of 2.9 million self-employed entrepreneurs worth more than 15 billion roubles should also be written off, Putin said. He also proposed writing off profit tax, accumulated by some Russian citizens on their so-called waived debts. According to the high-ranking official, the latter would mean writing off 22 billion roubles. ($1 = 58.8600 roubles) ",

        "title": "Obama says Chinese-led trade deal shows need for TPP: Washington Post",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday that a Chinese-led regional trade deal demonstrated the urgent need for Congress to approve the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. Obama has been pushing to finalize the TPP before he leaves office on Jan. 20, but he needs to overcome strong anti-trade sentiment from both the left wing of his own Democratic Party  as well as from the right flank of the Republican Party. Voter anxiety over the impact of trade deals on jobs and the environment has featured large in the campaigns of Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner for the Nov. 8 presidential election, and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. In an opinion piece published on the website of the Washington Post on Monday, Obama said he understood voter skepticism but that \u201cbuilding walls to isolate ourselves from the global economy\u201d would backfire on the American economy. \u201cChina is negotiating a trade deal that would carve up some of the fastest-growing markets in the world at our expense, putting American jobs, businesses and goods at risk,\u201d Obama said in the piece. Obama was referring to the 16-member Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, and noted that China was seeking to finalize the deal by the end of the year. \u201cThat trade deal won\u2019t prevent unfair competition among government-subsidized, state-owned enterprises. It won\u2019t protect a free and open Internet,\u201d Obama said, also criticizing the RCEP\u2019s lack of protections for intellectual property, labor standards and the environment. Obama, who plans a visit to TPP partners Japan and Vietnam later this month, argued the TPP would allow America to \u201ccall the shots\u201d on trade with Asia. \u201cThat\u2019s why my administration is working closely with leaders in congress to secure bipartisan approval for our trade agreement, mindful that the longer we wait, the harder it will be to pass the TPP,\u201d he said. Asked about Obama\u2019s comments, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said global trade rules should be discussed by all countries, not just set by one. China has an open attitude towards TPP, which should be promoted together along with RCEP to help achieve the goal of a free trade zone in the Asia Pacific, ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a daily news briefing in Beijing.

        "title": "New Russia probe leaks threaten to derail Trump's foreign trip",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump was hit on Friday by embarrassing leaks that a senior adviser was a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in a probe of possible collusion with Russia during last year\u2019s election campaign and that Trump had boasted to Russian officials of firing the man heading the investigation. The reports, emerging just as Trump jetted off to Saudi Arabia on his first foreign trip as president, were likely to extend the turmoil engulfing his administration since the May 9 firing of former FBI Director James Comey. The Washington Post, citing sources familiar with the matter, did not identify the senior Trump adviser except to say that the person of interest was close to Trump, a Republican who entered the White House four months ago. U.S. law enforcement uses the term \u201ca person of interest\u201d to mean someone who is part of a criminal investigation but not arrested or formally accused of a crime. The person may be cooperating or have information of use to investigators. Separately the New York Times reported that Trump boasted to Russian officials at a White House meeting last week that firing Comey relieved \u201cgreat pressure\u201d the president faced from a law-enforcement probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.  \u201cI just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job,\u201d Trump said, according to the Times, which cited a document summarizing the meeting and read to it by an unnamed U.S. official. \u201cI faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off.\u201d Trump met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russia\u2019s ambassador to Washington in the Oval Office the day after Trump fired Comey, who was in charge of the Russia election probe. The Times said the document was based on notes taken from inside the Oval Office. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the accuracy of that account. Comey, who has not spoken publicly in the 10 days since he was fired, will testify in an open session of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 election.  Committee leaders said on Friday he would appear sometime after the U.S. Memorial Day holiday on May 29. \u201cI am hopeful that he will clarify for the American people recent events that have been broadly reported in the media,\u201d the committee chairman, Republican Richard Burr, said in a statement announcing the appearance. Public approval of Trump has dropped to its lowest level since his inauguration, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday. The May 14-18 opinion poll found that 38 percent of adults approved of Trump while 56 percent disapproved. The remaining 6 percent had \u201cmixed feelings.\u201d U.S. stocks immediately pared gains after the reports but still closed higher for a second straight day. Earlier this week, investors dumped stocks in response to reports that Trump in February had asked Comey to stop investigating his former national security adviser, prompting accusations the president may have tried to hamper the probe. \u201cAs the president has stated before - a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity,\u201d White House spokesman Sean Spicer said in a statement in response to the Post report. After days of political tumult in Washington, the Justice Department announced the appointment on Thursday of a special counsel to look into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion by the Trump campaign. The Times report added to the impression given by Trump himself in a television interview last week in which he said the Russia issue was a factor in firing Comey. The White House has given different versions of the reasons for the dismissal. Asked about the Times report, Spicer said of the former FBI chief, \u201cby grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia\u2019s actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia.\u201d \u201cThe investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would not have ended it,\u201d Spicer said, adding that the real story was the leaks of \u201cprivate and highly classified conversations.\u201d Democrats, who have compared the widening scandal to the Watergate break-in and cover-up that brought down Republican former President Richard Nixon in 1974, were quick to pounce on the latest reports. Democratic Senator Edward Markey called them \u201cseismic revelations\u201d and questioned whether the United States might be heading into a constitutional crisis.  \u201cThis is an inflection point in the entire Russia collusion investigation,\u201d he told MSNBC. \u201cIt makes it very clear that what Donald Trump was trying to do was to end the Russian investigation.\u201d  \u201cThis is what OBSTRUCTION looks like: \u2018I faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off,\u2019\u201d Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy said on Twitter. Republican Representative Scott Taylor told CNN there was \u201cno question\u201d that Trump had \u201csome stumbles this week.\u201d But he added: \u201cI haven\u2019t lost my confidence in the president to be our president, I just haven\u2019t.\u201d Before the latest reports, the White House had hoped to shift attention away from the political firestorm in Washington to foreign policy as well as the president\u2019s ambitious pro-business economic agenda in Congress. Trump\u2019s trip, which also includes stops in Israel, Italy and Belgium next week, has been billed by the administration as a chance to visit places sacred to three of the world\u2019s major religions while giving him time to meet with Arab, Israeli and European leaders.   Trump, who has embraced what he describes as an \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to U.S. foreign policy and international trade, is expected to be welcomed warmly by leaders in Saudi Arabia  and Israel. Lingering questions over his views on the Iran nuclear deal, commitment to NATO security and skepticism of the Paris climate agreement, however, could generate tension at meetings with European counterparts in Brussels and Sicily.

For Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, it was a return to a role she knows well after she served as President Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state for four years. Trump, the Republican nominee, is a newcomer to the global stage who is hurriedly trying to play catch-up.  In rapid succession, Clinton met briefly with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Trump also met Sisi minutes after the Egyptian leader spoke with Clinton in the same Manhattan hotel. The meetings came on a day that started with Clinton suggesting Trump\u2019s harsh rhetoric toward Muslims aids the Islamic State militant group\u2019s recruiting efforts. Trump pushed back, arguing the United States was less safe as a result of Obama and Clinton\u2019s policies. Security questions arose in each of Monday\u2019s bilateral sessions, which took place as world leaders gathered for the U.N. General Assembly, with Clinton and Abe discussing concerns over North Korea and maritime issues involving China.  Clinton and Trump both spoke with Sisi about working more closely with Egypt to combat the Islamic State threat.  Trump\u2019s campaign released a statement saying that Trump \u201chighlighted how Egypt and the U.S. share a common enemy and the importance of working together in defeating radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d  With Clinton, Sisi also discussed his goal of moving Egypt toward \u201ca new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law and respects human rights and liberties.\u201d  Clinton and Poroshenko addressed Russian incursions into Ukrainian territory. Clinton started the session by saying Ukraine faces \u201cvery real problems and threats from Russian aggression\u201d and that she was \u201canxious to know how we can be supportive.\u201d  The session also resonated because of Trump\u2019s praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month. Trump called Putin a stronger leader than Obama, rattling both Democrats and Republicans in Washington.  The evening was not without drama, starting with Clinton\u2019s motorcade zooming through packed New York streets at rush hour and then quickly rushing from hotel to hotel. Trump also tried to bolster his foreign policy credentials last month when he went to Mexico to meet President Enrique Pena Nieto, but both sides ended up disagreeing about whether who would pay to build a border wall had been discussed.  Clinton called that episode an \u201cembarrassing international incident.\u201d ",

Obama\u2019s efforts to bring about an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement have failed over the nearly eight years he has been in the White House, with the latest push by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry collapsing in 2014. U.S. officials have held out the possibility Obama could lay out the rough outlines of a deal - \u201cparameters\u201d in diplomatic parlance - after the Nov. 8 presidential election and before he leaves office in January, but many analysts doubt this would have much effect. \u201cSurely Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel ...(and if) Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land,\u201d Obama said.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump sought to insert himself into congressional investigations on Russia on Wednesday, urging lawmakers to hear from one of his former advisers, Carter Page, to counter testimony by directors of the FBI and CIA. Trump has been dismissive of probes by the FBI and several congressional panels into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion with his  campaign. In a series of early morning tweets, the president quoted a letter from Page, in which he asked to address the House Intelligence Committee promptly and referred to what he characterized as faulty testimony from U.S. intelligence officials. Trump accused Democrats of blocking Page\u2019s testimony, without citing evidence but referring to an unidentified report.  \u201cSo now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, don\u2019t want him to testify. He blows away their case against him & now wants to clear his name by showing \u2018the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan...\u2019 Witch Hunt!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to the former directors of the FBI and CIA.         Trump\u2019s tweets came as his advisers are planning to establish a \u201cwar room\u201d to combat mounting questions about communication between Russia and his campaign. The White House said on Wednesday it would not answer any more questions about the investigations, referring reporters instead to Trump\u2019s outside attorney, Marc Kasowitz. The president\u2019s penchant for tweeting could complicate White House efforts to tamp down the scandal if the messages appear to address the investigations. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House committee, swatted back at Trump on Twitter with a reference to the president\u2019s acknowledgment to NBC that he was thinking of \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d when he fired Comey on May 9.  \u201c@POTUS, appreciate suggestion on witnesses but feel you may not have probe\u2019s interests at heart. Ex: Firing FBI Dir because of Russia probe,\u201d Schiff wrote. Democrats say Comey\u2019s dismissal was aimed at hindering the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Russia investigation. CNN reported on Wednesday that Comey would confirm reports that Trump had asked him to let up in an investigation of former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s contacts with Russia in upcoming public testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have urged him to tweet less and more wisely. U.S. Representative Sean Duffy said on Wednesday the Russia investigations were becoming too much of a distraction in Trump\u2019s 4-month-old presidency. \u201cI think the president should step aside from any comments, any tweets on the investigation and focus on the agenda that he ran on,\u201d Duffy said on CNN. \u201cStop tweeting about it, stop talking about it and get about the business of your agenda.\u201d Page, who provided a copy of his letter to Reuters, said the House committee postponed an appearance scheduled for next week without giving a specific reason. Schiff said in a statement that he and the Republican overseeing the panel\u2019s probe, Representative Mike Conaway, want to review documents before interviewing witnesses.  Russia has denied U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Moscow interfered in the election campaign to try to tilt the vote in Trump\u2019s favor, and the president has denied any collusion. Congressional committees have contacted a parade of Trump associates and advisers to request information in their probes. In addition to Page, they include Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former White House press officer Boris Epshteyn, personal lawyer Michael Cohen and informal adviser Roger Stone. On Wednesday, the House committee approved subpoenas for Flynn and Cohen. It also approved subpoenas to intelligence agencies seeking records showing which former Obama administration officials requested the \u201cunmasking\u201d of the names of Trump associates who were inadvertently picked up in top-secret communications intercepts. Flynn has also been subpoenaed by the Senate Intelligence Committee. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Opponents of a bill that would allow lawsuits against Saudi Arabia\u2019s government over the Sept. 11 attacks kept up their fight against the measure on Tuesday, a day before the U.S. Senate is expected to oppose President Barack Obama\u2019s veto, allowing the bill to become law. Opponents circulated a letter from Ash Carter, Obama\u2019s Secretary of Defense, saying that the \u201cJustice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,\u201d known as JASTA, posed risks for U.S. forces abroad. \u201cWhile we are sympathetic to the intent of JASTA, its potential second- and third-order consequences could be devastating to the Department and its Service members and could undermine our important counterterrorism efforts abroad,\u201d Carter wrote to Representative Mac Thornberry. As Reuters reported on Friday, Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has circulated a letter to his fellow House of Representatives Republicans saying that he will vote to sustain Obama\u2019s veto and urging them to do the same. Obama vetoed the legislation on Friday. If Congress gets enough votes to override the veto for the first time since Obama became president in 2009 the bill would become law. It takes two-thirds majorities in both the Senate and House to override a veto.  The legislation passed the Senate and House without opposition, in reaction to long-running suspicions, denied by Riyadh, that the hijackers of the four U.S. jetliners that attacked the United States in 2001 were backed by the Saudi government. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. While a few lawmakers have expressed concerns about the implications of the bill, it still has strong support, among both Republicans and Obama\u2019s fellow Democrats. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, told reporters on Tuesday she would vote to override. She said the vote was about giving a day in court to survivors and relatives of victims of the 2001 attacks, not a rebuke of Obama. \u201cIt isn\u2019t anti-president,\u201d she said.  ",

        "title": "One dead, scores arrested in unrest over delayed Honduran vote count",
        "text": "TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - At least one protester died, over 20 people were injured and more than 100 others were arrested for looting in Honduras after a delayed and disputed presidential vote count sparked unrest amid opposition accusations of electoral fraud. Honduras was due to publish the final result of last Sunday s presidential election at 9 p.m. local time (0300 GMT) on Friday, the electoral tribunal said, but opposition complaints about the count appeared set to impede that.  Election results initially favored opposition candidate and TV star Salvador Nasralla by five points with more than half the votes counted. They then swung in favor of U.S.-backed center-right President Juan Orlando Hernandez after the count came to a halt on Monday and resumed over a day later, sparking protests. The tribunal has said it will hand-count some 1,031 outstanding ballot boxes with irregularities - or nearly 6 percent of the total - after the count halted with Hernandez ahead by less than 50,000 votes, or about 1.5 percentage points. However, Nasralla s center-left alliance has called for votes to be recounted in three of Honduras  18 departments, or regions, and refused to recognize the tribunal s special count until its demands for a wider review were met.  If Juan Orlando wins, we re ready to accept that, but we know that wasn t the case, we know that Salvador won and that s why they re refusing the transparency demands,  said Marlon Ochoa, campaign manager of Nasralla s alliance. International concern has grown about the electoral crisis in the poor Central American country, which struggles with violent drug gangs and one of the world s highest murder rates. Police sources said at least one man had been shot and killed at a protest in the city of La Ceiba, while about 12 members of the military and police force had been injured in demonstrations that snarled traffic outside Honduras  main port on Friday and around the country. At least 10 protesters were injured in the capital of Tegucigalpa, according to the city s Hospital Escuela. Military officials called for peaceful protests after police reports of looting in the capital and other cities. In the country s second-biggest city of San Pedro Sula, thick plumes of black smoke clouded the air as protesters burned tires and police tried to disperse the crowds with tear gas. More than 100 people were also arrested on suspicion of looting in San Pedro Sula on Friday, a police spokesman said, and local media carried footage of shops being plundered. People flocked to supermarkets on Friday, stocking up on food and provisions as major roads and supply routes were blocked across the country by angry protesters. Lines appeared outside gas stations and cash machines. Banks clogged up with people wanting to withdraw or deposit money.  I m filling the tank with gas in case anything happens, the situation looks bad and there are protests all over the city,  said Carlos Valle, a 61-year-old pensioner, as he joined a long line of vehicles waiting at a fuel pump in Tegucigalpa. Both Hernandez and Nasralla, a television game show host allied with leftists, claimed victory after the election, and the challenger has said he will not accept the tribunal s result because of doubts over the counting process. Leading a center-left alliance, the 64-year-old Nasralla is one of Honduras  best-known faces and backed by former President Manuel Zelaya, a leftist ousted in a coup in 2009. Zelaya weighed into the debate on Thursday in a letter in which he accused the tribunal of  electoral crimes  on behalf of Hernandez, who himself was standing for re-election enabled by a contentious 2015 Supreme Court ruling. One of the four magistrates on the electoral tribunal on Thursday flagged  serious doubts  about the counting process.  The Organization of American States (OAS) on Wednesday convinced both candidates to vow to respect the final result once disputed votes had been checked. But a few hours later Nasralla rejected the OAS accord, saying his opponents were trying to rob him. He urged supporters to take to the streets in protest. ",

        "title": "Financial firms fear turmoil over fraught U.S. debt ceiling talks",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Financial firms are sounding alarm bells and dusting off contingency plans over fears an increasingly dysfunctional U.S. Congress may fail to reach a deal to raise the country\u2019s debt limit. Several lobbyists, representing dozens of bankers, investors and credit rating agencies, told Reuters they are worried that dynamics at play in Washington \u2013  a bitterly divided Republican party and unpredictable President Donald Trump \u2013 could rule out a deal before an October deadline.  Policymakers have vowed to provide disaster relief to areas affected by Hurricane Harvey, boosting hopes the debt limit battle could be included in an agreement on a legislative package. But the acrimonious atmosphere following Trump\u2019s remarks about the Charlottesville protests this month, which cost him key backers in the business community and raised worries about his ability to broker a deal, still lingers. The debt ceiling is a legal cap on how much money the government can borrow to fund its budget deficits and meet debt obligations. Failure to raise it from the current $19.8 trillion could lead to default, sending shockwaves across global markets. \u201cThe stakes here are incredibly high. The economic impact associated with debt default is so immense,\u201d said Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association (ABA), one of the country\u2019s key financial lobby groups.  \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring this extremely closely and we will mobilize as needed throughout September.\u201d While leading lawmakers and the administration have pledged it will get done, some corners of financial markets are already on edge. After all, Goldman Sachs estimated that failure to lift the cap would force a government spending cut equal to between 3 and 4 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, which would have crippling economic consequences. Moreover, previous debt limit negotiations went down to the wire, and the now-notorious 2011 standoff led S&P Global Ratings to downgrade U.S. sovereign debt for the first time. The episode wiped $2.4 trillion off U.S. stocks.  The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), a trade group representing hundreds of financial firms, said it had reprised contingency plans drawn-up during the previous showdowns and was working with firms to prepare for extreme volatility in the event of a default. These plans aim to ensure firms have enough technology capacity, staff and cash to handle high trading volumes.  A separate plan being reviewed by another trade organization, the Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG), includes protocols for trading in defaulted Treasuries, according to information on its website. SIFMA is also planning for that.  \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re on the same page and prepared, should anything happen,\u201d said Robert Toomey, SIFMA\u2019s managing director and associate counsel. \u201cWe believe this will get done, but we still have to prepare for it notwithstanding.\u201d A spokesman for the TMPG was not immediately available for comment.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has urged Congress to raise the cap by Sept. 29 and said last week he was \u201c100 percent confident\u201d this would happen. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have also promised the United States would not default But Wall Street players, who are highly exposed to any potential market mayhem, are worried Mnuchin and McConnell will not be able to get a divided Republican party to play ball. Many conservative Republicans have indicated they will only vote for a debt limit bill that contains promises of federal spending cuts, meaning Trump, Mnuchin and McConnell will likely need Democrat votes to get the bill through. The president is also seen as a wild card after he failed to denounce Nazi sympathizers at protests in Charlottesville. This, combined with his attacks on members of his own party, has raised questions over Trump\u2019s ability to build consensus on the debt limit, one bank lobbyist said. \u201cEveryone is very worried,\u201d he added.  Trump last week tweeted that the ceiling was \u201cnow a mess\u201d blaming Ryan and McConnell. \u201cHe took the two people he has to count on for this, and smack[ed] them around. It\u2019s going to make it harder,\u201d said Steve Bell, a former Republican director of the Senate Budget Committee and now director at the Bipartisan Policy Center, referring to Trump\u2019s tweet.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Industry executives also point to an understaffed Treasury, which has yet to hold meetings with banks and investors - a tactic used by the Obama administration to calm Wall Street jitters.  Lobbyists said they expected to hear from the administration after Labor Day, when they would also attempt to persuade skeptics in Congress to pass the limit. \u201cTreasury routinely reaches out to market participants to foster a steady dialogue on key issues, including the debt limit,\u201d said a Treasury spokesperson. \u201cThe government intends to pay its debts.\u201d ",

        "title": "EU to ban business ties with Pyongyang over nuclear tests",
        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is set to agree on Monday to ban business ties with North Korea, part of a new package of sanctions to isolate Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs. The practical impact of the moves is likely to be mostly symbolic: Brussels will impose an oil embargo and a ban on EU investment, but it sells no crude to North Korea and European companies have no substantial investments there. North Korean workers in the EU, of which Brussels estimates there are about 400 mainly in Poland, will face a lower limit on the amount for money they can send home and their work visas will not be renewed once they expire. The measures to be agreed by EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg go further than the latest round of multi-lateral sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council.  The North Koreans appear to be uninterested in having the EU get involved as a peace mediator,  said an EU diplomat.  The North Koreans want direct talks with the United States, but President (Donald) Trump has ruled that out,  the diplomat said. The sanctions will add three more top North Korean officials and six businesses to a blacklist banning them from travel to the EU and freezing their assets. That will take the total of those sanctioned by the EU to 41 individuals and 10 companies, a senior EU official said. Separately, U.N. sanctions target 63 people and 53 companies and institutions.     We have in place everything that we possibly could do to try to get the DPRK to change their behavior,  the EU official said, using North Korea s official name of the Democratic People s Republic of Korea. Although the EU does not export crude to North Korea, its aim is to push other countries to ban oil exports, either unilaterally or at the United Nations. The U.N. Security Council last month capped North Korean imports of crude oil, but China and Russia resisted an outright ban. Diplomats said that if Pyongyang launches more missiles, the EU could consider imposing sanctions on non-EU firms doing business with Pyongyang, as the United States has done. However, such  secondary sanctions  need clear evidence to avoid legal challenges and the bloc is reluctant to anger China, a top trading partner, by targeting Chinese people and firms. ",

        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China is testing a new dredger ship that will greatly enhance its land reclamation capabilities, a state media report said on Sunday, as the country continues to develop facilities in the South China Sea in a bid to strengthen its claims in the waters. State-run Beijing News newspaper said the Tian Kun began water tests on Friday. A cutter suction dredger is a type of a ship used for large-scale projects to create or reclaim land.       For example, there are many hard coral reefs on the sea floor of the South China Sea,  the paper quoted Zhang Xiaofeng, chief engineer for the vessel, as saying, adding the ship will be put into service sometime in the first half of 2018.  Recent satellite images show that China has quietly undertaken more construction and reclamation in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year, in a bid to strengthen its grip despite objections from Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam as well as the United States. Some experts say China will land its first deployments of jet fighters onto its runways in the Spratly islands in coming months.  The United States is concerned China s construction of islands and military buildup in the waters could be used to restrict free nautical movement. Its ships have carried out freedom of navigation patrols in the area, angering China.  The subject could come up when Trump visits Beijing next week as part of his 12-day Asia trip and meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping, though North Korea s recent nuclear and missile tests are expected to feature more prominently in talks.  The South China Sea issue isn t an issue between China and the United States,  China Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang told reporters on Friday, adding there is no issue with freedom of navigation in the region and that China has indisputable sovereignty over islands and surrounding waters.

        "text": "BETHESDA, Md. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump visited wounded U.S. service members at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Saturday, his first visit as president to the armed forces hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, outside Washington. Accompanied by his wife, Melania, Trump awarded Army Sergeant First Class Alvaro Barrientos the Purple Heart, the medal given to members of the U.S. military wounded or killed in battle. Barrientos was injured in Afghanistan on March 17 when an Afghan soldier opened fire inside a base in Helmand province, wounding three U.S. soldiers. Barrientos\u2019s right leg was amputated, according to a White House official. The president put his hand on the sergeant\u2019s shoulder and kissed the sergeant\u2019s wife, Tammy, on the cheek. Then he pinned the Purple Heart to the sergeant\u2019s lapel and clapped him on the back. \u201cWhen I heard about this, I wanted to do it myself. ...

During his eight years as president, Barack Obama made visits to Walter Reed a regular occurrence, particularly when the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were raging.

        "text": "(Reuters) - Detroit would sell its first general obligation bonds since exiting bankruptcy in December 2014 under a proposal by Mayor Mike Duggan\u2019s administration to refund up to $660 million of outstanding bonds. The city council on Tuesday sent the plan to refund up to $275 million of unlimited tax GO bonds sold in 2014 and up to $385 million of limited tax GO bonds sold in 2010 and 2012 to its Budget, Finance and Audit Committee for consideration.  The outstanding bonds were issued through the Michigan Finance Authority and backed by the city\u2019s share of distributable state aid payments. John Naglick, Detroit\u2019s finance director, said Detroit expects to capture lower interest rates in the bond refundings to save money for the budget and to lower property tax rates supporting the bonds.  \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for this move to record low rates, we wouldn\u2019t do this,\u201d he said. Ten and 30-year yields on Municipal Market Data\u2019s benchmark triple-A scale are at or near all-time lows, driven by big investor demand for debt sold by states, cities, schools and other municipal issuers. Detroit was able to shed about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt and obligations in the biggest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy. In its first post-bankruptcy public debt offering last August, the city restructured $245 million of variable-rate revenue bonds backed by city income taxes into a fixed-rate mode at a hefty spread over MMD\u2019s scale. If the GO bond refundings are approved by the city council committee on Wednesday, the measures would head for a full-council vote on June 21. Naglick said the issuance also needs approval from the Detroit Financial Review Commission, the city\u2019s post-bankruptcy oversight board, which meets on June 27.    ",

        "title": "FBI's Comey meets with top U.S. congressional leaders",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey on Thursday met with senior congressional leaders, including the intelligence committee chiefs, FBI and congressional officials said. The officials declined to discuss the subject of Comey\u2019s meeting with the group of leaders known as the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d. U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged that the Obama administration wiretapped his election campaign. The Gang of Eight, who have routine access to highly classified materials, include House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and its top Democrat, Adam Schiff. Senate members include Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the top Republican and Democrat on the intelligence committee, Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner. The House intelligence committee on Wednesday asked the Justice Department in a letter for copies of documents which if they exist could shed light on Trump\u2019s allegation. A law enforcement source said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was in discussions with the National Security Division of the Justice Department as to how to respond to public and congressional inquiries about the existence or non-existence of such eavesdropping. If Trump\u2019s campaign or advisers were indeed being wiretapped, the most likely legal path for the Obama administration to do so would be to have the Justice Department ask the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for permission to eavesdrop. Trump accused predecessor Barack Obama on Saturday of wiretapping him during the late stages of the campaign, but offered no evidence for an allegation which an Obama spokesman said was \u201csimply false\u201d. The intelligence committee\u2019s letter, addressed to Dana Boente, the acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General, also asks for copies of any such orders actually issued by the court and any electronic surveillance warrants related to Trump or his associates issued last year by a federal judge or magistrate under a wide-ranging anti-crime law. Reuters saw a copy of the letter, signed by Nunes and Schiff, on Thursday. The letter has not been publicly released. Nunes said on Tuesday he had seen no evidence to support Trump\u2019s wiretapping allegation. Law enforcement sources have said that the FBI is pursuing a wide-ranging counter-intelligence investigation of alleged contacts between Trump associates and Russians, as well as two separate investigations into pre-election email hacking linked to Russia which mainly targeted Democratic political operatives.

        "title": "Trump to host Sept. 18 meeting of world leaders on U.N. reform",
        "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of the United Nations, will seek to gather global support for reforming the world body when he hosts an event at U.N. headquarters in New York on Sept. 18, a day before he formally addresses the 193-member organization. Countries will be invited to attend Trump s function if they sign on to a U.S.-drafted 10-point political declaration backing efforts by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres  to initiate effective, meaningful reform,  according to a draft of the political declaration seen by Reuters on Friday. Trump has complained that the U.S. share of the world body s budget is unfair, pushed to slash funding and described it as a  club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.  Trump, who took office in January, has since described U.S. funding as  peanuts  compared to the important work of the organization. The United States is the biggest U.N. contributor, providing 22 percent of its $5.4 billion biennial core budget and 28.5 percent of its $7.3 billion peacekeeping budget. The contributions are agreed on by the 193-member General Assembly. Trump, Guterres, who also took office in January, and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley are scheduled to speak at the Sept. 18 event, diplomats said. The draft political declaration states:  We support the secretary-general in making concrete changes in the United Nations system to better align its work on humanitarian response, development and sustaining peace initiatives.   We commit to reducing mandate duplication, redundancy and overlap, including among the main organs of the United Nations,  the draft declaration reads. The United States also is reviewing each of the U.N. peacekeeping missions as annual mandates come up for Security Council renewal in a bid to cut costs. The United States is a veto-wielding council member, along with Britain, France, Russia and China. Haley has said there is  a lot of fat around the edges and some abuses that happen at the U.N. but I do think it is very important that we make the most of it.  Ethiopia, which is president of the 15-member Security Council for September, said on Friday it would hold a high-level council meeting on peacekeeping reform on Sept. 20 that will be chaired by Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. Ethiopian U.N. Ambassador Tekeda Alemu told reporters it was unclear if Trump would attend the meeting, which would be his first appearance in the Security Council, but that he expected about 10 heads of state or government to be present.

        "title": "Conservative Koch network criticizes U.S. Senate healthcare bill",
        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (Reuters) - Officials with the conservative U.S. political network overseen by the Koch brothers say they are unhappy with the healthcare bill that may be voted on by the Senate this week and will lobby for changes to it. At a weekend event with conservative donors, top aides to Charles Koch, the billionaire energy magnate, said the Senate bill does not go far enough to dismantle former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law, also known as Obamacare. \u201cWe have been disappointed that movement has not been more dramatic toward a full repeal,\u201d said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a grassroots advocacy group backed by Charles Koch and his brother, David. The Senate\u2019s 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by Senate Majority Leader McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump to repeal Obamacare, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since its passage in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally called the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. Phillips and other aides to the Koch network told Reuters they want to see the Senate bill do more to roll back Obamacare\u2019s expansion of the Medicaid program for poor and disabled Americans. They also contend the bill does not do enough to reform the U.S. healthcare system and cut costs. The aides said lobbying efforts to reshape the bill are continuing ahead of a planned vote. Similar concerns helped steer the House\u2019s version of the bill in a more conservative direction. A primary mover of that effort, Mark Meadows, a Republican congressman from North Carolina, attended the Koch donor event. Meadows, chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus in the House, said he is prepared to support the Senate bill if it clears that chamber, a sign that quick action to land the legislation on Trump\u2019s desk is possible. However, Meadows said the Senate version of the bill would need to be amended to allow insurers who sell plans on Obamacare\u2019s insurance exchanges to offer less-expensive plans that do not comply with that law\u2019s coverage requirements. Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who currently opposes the Senate bill, has offered an amendment along those lines. Cruz attended the Koch event here, as did Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who remain undecided. Meadows also seeks an amendment that would allow some consumers who have private health savings accounts to deduct the cost of insurance premiums from their taxes. Senate leaders have set a goal of passing the healthcare measure by the end of this week, ahead of the July 4 congressional recess, which would then send it back to the House. If the Senate passes legislation this week that is palatable to the House, Meadows said it is conceivable the House could pass that version and choose to forgo a formal conference committee that would reconcile the Senate and House bills. That, he said, could result in sending the bill to Trump\u2019s desk for his signature before the recess. Getting a vote by the end of the week could be difficult. Five Senate Republicans, including Cruz, have publicly voiced their opposition to the current Senate draft. No Senate Democrats are expected to back it, which means McConnell cannot afford to lose more than two Senate Republicans. As a sign of the Koch network\u2019s influence, Phillips said his organization is prepared to spend as much as $400 million before next year\u2019s congressional elections to advocate for the network\u2019s conservative causes.

        "text": "BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand is seeking to prosecute ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra for graft under a law that allows politicians to be tried in absentia, an official said on Tuesday, months after Thaksin s sister was sentenced to jail in her absence. Thailand is divided broadly between those backing Thaksin and his sister, former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, whose government was removed in a 2014 coup, and the elite in the capital, Bangkok. A former commerce minister and member of Yingluck s Puea Thai Party that was ousted in the coup said the planned prosecution of Thaksin was politically motivated. The former telecommunications tycoon was ousted in a 2006 coup and has since lived in self-imposed exile to avoid a graft conviction in 2008 he says was politically motivated.  Separate cases against Thaksin, including graft cases in 2008 and 2012, had to be suspended until he returned to Thailand for trial. But an amendment to the law in September makes it possible for politicians to be prosecuted in their absence.  The 2008 and 2012 cases involved Thaksin s alleged conflict of interest in a telecoms concession and suspected abuse of power.   Public prosecutors put in a request to the supreme court today to proceed with the two cases without presence of the accused, in accordance with the new law,  Wanchart Santikunchorn, a spokesman for the office of the attorney-general, told reporters. Thaksin was not immediately available for comment.  Thaksin re-shaped Thai politics after building a business empire, winning staunch support with populist policies that raised living standards, especially among the rural poor, and propelled him or his loyalists to victory in every election since 2001. Yingluck fled the country in August, ahead of a verdict in a negligence trial, but was eventually found guilty and handed down a five-year jail term in absentia in September.  Former commerce minister Watana Muangsook said the junta was damaging the country with politically motivated court cases.   The law which allows court proceedings in absentia of the accused is aimed at destroying the regime s political opposition,  Watana said in a statement to Reuters. Wanchart denied the moves against the Shinawatra family were biased, saying they were in line with the newly amended law.   ",

        "title": "U.S. states gird for fight as Trump targets consumer finance watchdog",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pennsylvania\u2019s Attorney General is leading the charge among his Democratic peers preparing to shore up protections for borrowers and savers while President Donald Trump follows through on a pledge to defang a powerful consumer finance watchdog. Since he was sworn in January, Democrat Josh Shapiro has built up his own consumer finance unit in preparation for when Republican Trump\u2019s officials take over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The unit is staffed with more than a dozen people and led by a former senior CFPB attorney. Shapiro and this team have already filed cases against Navient (NAVI.O), a student loan servicer, which is accused of deceiving borrowers in order to drive up profits, and are leading a 48-state investigation into hacking at Equifax (EFX.N), a consumer credit bureau. \u201cWe\u2019re demonstrating a capacity to handle these big, complex consumer financial protection cases,\u201d Shapiro told Reuters, adding that attorneys general from both parties have asked about how they can \u201cmimic our efforts\u201d. Navient has said it operates within federal laws and rules on student loans, and has contested similar charges brought by the CFPB in court. An Equifax spokesperson said the company cannot comment on pending litigation, \u201cbut we remain focused on helping our customers, as well as their employees and consumers, to navigate this situation.\u201d Shapiro expects his case load will grow, particularly now that Trump has installed his budget director and fierce CFPB critic, Mick Mulvaney, as temporary chief of the agency. The press office at the Office of Management and Budget, which is currently handling public relations for CFPB, said it was too early to comment on Democratic attorneys\u2019 plans. \u201cHowever, of course we will carry out what we are statutorily obliged to enforce,\u201d spokesman John Czwartacki said. Created in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis to crack down on predatory financial practices, the CFBP has long been criticized by Republicans, including Trump, who say it is far too powerful and burdens lenders with red tape.  Shapiro is part of a group of Democratic attorneys general from powerful and large states such as California and New York who disagree with Trump\u2019s call for financial deregulation.    Since Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, those top law enforcement officials have sued the administration at least 25 times over its crackdown on immigration and dismantling of regulations across a range of areas from energy to education.  When it comes to financial consumer protection state attorneys general wield an additional potentially powerful weapon. A little-known provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, which created the CFPB, gives them the authority to enforce the agency\u2019s rules and its broad ban on \u201cunfair, deceptive and abusive\u201d practices beyond state lines. States have rarely used those provisions while Richard Cordray, appointed by President Barack Obama and known for aggressively pursuing financial firms, was in charge of the watchdog. But with his departure last week, Mulvaney freezing new rulemakings and hiring and a permanent successor expected to loosen the watchdog\u2019s regulation and enforcement, top attorneys in states such as Pennsylvania and California say they are preparing to get more active. \u201cIf we have to do this with just states that makes it more difficult but that doesn\u2019t make it impossible,\u201d said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat. One difficulty for states wanting to pursue federal enforcement cases and go after financial firms across state lines, is that, by law, they must notify the CFPB, said Ori Lev, consumer financial services partner at law firm Mayer Brown.  If they proceed without the CFPB\u2019 blessing or if the agency changes its mind about a case, then the agency could challenge them in federal court, and they would most likely have to defer to the CFPB, said C. Boyden Gray, a founding partner of Boyden Gray & Associates, who works with the conservative Federalist Society on tracking regulation. Still, attorneys general have jurisdiction to sue institutions operating in their states under state consumer protection laws and they could join forces to pursue cases nationally. Attorneys general contacted by Reuters and the Democratic Attorneys General Association, representing 22 officials, or nearly half the top state attorneys in the country, said they were prepared to take on more cases. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said his office\u2019s consumer finance division now had 27 attorneys, compared with 11 four years ago.  \u201cConsequently, we are well positioned to use all the tools available to us to protect Washingtonians if a new leader of the CFPB does not share director Cordray\u2019s vigor for protecting consumers,\u201d the Democrat said.  Before the consumer watchdog was created, states often took the lead in cases involving consumer lenders. As Ohio\u2019s attorney general, Cordray, for example, led the investigation of financial firms which precipitated the financial crisis, winning more than $2 billion in settlements for the state and its pension funds. Consumer advocacy groups have generally applauded the work of both the CFPB and the states on consumer protections, but some Republican attorneys general have sided with Trump on the need to rein in the federal watchdog.  In a Nov. 27 letter to Trump, Republican attorneys from West Virginia, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas and Oklahoma said Mulvaney would help curb \u201cthe CFPB\u2019s practice of overreaching regulation that harms the interests of consumers and small financial institutions.\u201d Anticipating more state activity, Maria Earley, partner at the law firm Reed Smith, has been advising clients facing CFPB charges against stalling in hopes the watchdog will become more lenient under Trump. \u201cYou may want to litigate to run out the clock, but you\u2019re going to have six, seven, eight states who will start looking into you,\u201d Earley said, adding she has settled three CFPB cases for clients since Trump took office. Reuters could not independently verify this number. Michelle Rogers, a partner with Buckley Sandler, said Wall Street may end up with increased regulatory complexity rather than relief as the state attorneys step in. \u201cThey are more nimble than a big federal agency. They have their own staff, and their own agenda, and they can send out a subpoena on a whim on a broader set of issues,\u201d she said. (This story corrects 18th paragraph to attribute idea to C. Boyden Gray, instead of Ori Lev) ",

        "title": "Illinois governor stalls bond sales, seeks other options to pay bills",
        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner said on Monday he was holding off  issuance of up to $6 billion of bonds to help pay down the state\u2019s more than $14 billion in overdue bills despite the state comptroller\u2019s public plea for the debt sale.  The Republican governor called on Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza to tap more than $600 million in various state accounts first to pay bills. Authorization for the general obligation bonds and for using money parked in the accounts was included in the fiscal 2018 budget the Democratic-controlled legislature enacted in July over the governor\u2019s vetoes. [nL1N1JX20R] Rauner also said the state cannot go to market with the debt until he works with state lawmakers to identify an appropriation or plan to pay off the new bonds.  \u201cThis bonding in and of itself is not the answer,\u201d Rauner told reporters. In a video and statement on Monday, Mendoza said Illinois\u2019 bill backlog is costing residents $2 million a day in late payment penalties that can reach as much as 12 percent a year. The bond authorization, which expires on Dec. 31, was aimed at having Rauner\u2019s budget office sell the 12-year bonds at a lower interest rate.  The debt is covered under the Illinois GO Bond Act, which constitutes an irrevocable and continuing appropriation for principal and interest payments on all of the state\u2019s outstanding bonds, according to budget legislation. Illinois\u2019 unprecedented two-year budget impasse ballooned the unpaid bill total to a record $15.4 billion in June. As of Friday, the backlog stood at $14.35 billion.  Abdon Pallasch, a spokesman for the Democratic comptroller, said inter-fund transfers were already underway. \u201cWhat we need right now is movement by the governor\u2019s office and a solid timetable for refinancing the debt so that our office can establish a comprehensive cash management plan for the remainder of fiscal year 2018,\u201d he said. On Monday, Illinois bonds due in 12 years were yielding  4.13 percent, according to Municipal Market Data, a unit of Thomson Reuters. Illinois has the lowest credit ratings and pays the highest borrowing costs among the 50 U.S. states. Since enacting its first budget in two years along with a $5 billion income tax hike, and subsequently evading junk bond ratings, the state\u2019s so-called credit spread over MMD\u2019s benchmark triple-A yield scale has narrowed. Mendoza\u2019s office said the new borrowing will provide some relief to service providers and businesses that have been waiting months for payment.  \u201cOver the past two years without a budget, they have had to exhaust their lines of credit, lay off employees and, in some cases, turn away Illinois citizens in need of services,\u201d a  statement from the comptroller said.

        "title": "Iran, EU and Russia defend nuclear deal after Trump threat",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iran, U.S. allies in Europe and Russia on Friday defended the 2015 nuclear agreement with Tehran and said they would stick by it, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to terminate the agreement. Trump said in a Washington speech that he would not certify that Iran is complying with its agreement with six world powers and the European Union, despite a determination by the U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog that Tehran is meeting the deal\u2019s terms. The Republican president threw the issue to the U.S. Congress, which has 60 days to decide whether to reinstate U.S. sanctions. He warned that if \u201cwe are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.\u201d Trump\u2019s actions appeared to leave the United States relatively isolated on the world stage. His hawkish new stance toward Iran, including steps against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, received strong backing only from Israel and Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iran will remain committed to the multinational deal as long as it serves the country\u2019s national interests. Trump\u2019s decision to decertify the deal will isolate the United States, as other signatories of the accord remained committed to it, Rouhani said in a live television address. The deal was not renegotiable, he said. The agreement, negotiated by Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, eased sanctions on Tehran in returns for strict limits on its nuclear program. Trump\u2019s stance put him at odds with key U.S. allies, including Britain, France and Germany who, along with Russia and China, negotiated the deal with Iran alongside the European Union. In Brussels, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said Washington could not unilaterally cancel the agreement. \u201cWe cannot afford as the international community to dismantle a nuclear agreement that is working,\u201d said Mogherini, who chaired the final stages of the landmark talks. \u201cThis deal is not a bilateral agreement. \u201cThe international community, and the European Union with it, has clearly indicated that the deal is, and will continue to be, in place,\u201d Mogherini told reporters in Brussels. The leaders of Britain, France and Germany issued a joint statement warning the United States against taking decisions that could harm the nuclear deal such as re-imposing sanctions. The three leaders also said they shared U.S. concerns over Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program and regional destabilizing activities and were ready to work with Washington to address those concerns. French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office said he had spoken with Rouhani by telephone and assured him of France\u2019s commitment to the deal, but that Tehran must strictly comply with it. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said there was no place in international diplomacy for threatening and aggressive rhetoric, and said such methods were doomed to fail, in a statement issued after Trump\u2019s speech. The ministry said Trump\u2019s decision to de-certify the deal would not have a direct impact on implementation of the agreement but that it ran counter to its spirit. There was no immediate reaction from China, though Alexei Pushkov, a pro-Kremlin lawmaker in the upper house of the Russian parliament, said neither Moscow nor Beijing backed Trump\u2019s stance. \u201cRussia of course does not support the U.S. position, nor does China. So Trump will be left in proud isolation in an attempt to improve his image among his own supporters,\u201d Pushkov told Russia\u2019s state-run Rossiya-24 TV station.  The head of the U.N.\u2019s International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran was complying with the accord, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, under the world\u2019s \u201cmost robust nuclear verification regime.\u201d \u201cThe nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under  the JCPOA are being implemented,\u201d Yukiya Amano, director general of the IAEA said in a statement. \u201cWhat has been agreed ... must be fully implemented. It is a very important deal, I\u2019m sorry to see what is now happening,\u201d former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters at the United Nations on Friday. Ban, who stepped down at the end of 2016, was U.N. chief when the deal was agreed. Trump received support from Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, all of which oppose what they say are Iran\u2019s expansionary moves in the Middle East. \u201cPresident Trump has just created an opportunity to fix this bad deal, to roll back Iran\u2019s aggression and to confront its criminal support of terrorism,\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement. In their comments, the Gulf states focused on Trump\u2019s overall Iran policy rather than the nuclear deal itself. Saudi Arabia welcomed what it called Trump\u2019s \u201cdecisive strategy\u201d toward Iran and said lifting sanctions had allowed Tehran to develop its ballistic missile program, step up its support for militant groups including Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen, and attack global shipping lanes. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Riyadh government said in a statement it had supported the nuclear agreement, \u201cbut Iran took advantage of the economic gain from raising sanctions and used it to continue destabilizing the region\u201d. The United Arab Emirates said it fully supported the new U.S. policy toward Iran and renewed its commitment to work with Washington to counter Iran\u2019s support of extremism, the state news agency WAM reported. \u201cThe UAE announces its full support to the new U.S. strategy to deal with the Iranian policies undermining security and  stability,\u201d WAM said on its Twitter account.

        "text": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi-led coalition aircraft struck a military police camp in the Houthi-controlled Yemeni capital Sanaa on Wednesday, killing at least 39 people and wounding 90 more, including some prisoners, an official and witnesses said. The strike is part of an air campaign by the Western-backed coalition on the Iran-allied Houthis that has escalated since the Houthis crushed an uprising last week led by former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh and killed him. One official in the camp said the coalition aircraft had launched seven raids on the camp, located in the eastern part of Sanaa, where some 180 prisoners were being held. The official said rescue teams had pulled out 35 bodies from the rubble, while the rest were not accounted for. It was the latest in a string of air raids the coalition has conducted on Sanaa and other parts of the country, sometimes causing multiple casualties among civilians. A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition could not immediately be reached for comment on the report. The coalition denies that it targets civilians. The United States and Britain provide political backing as well as weapons and logistical support for the Saudi-led coalition, which has been fighting since 2015 to restore Yemen s internationally-recognised president, Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, to power.

        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - A foreign-policy adviser to U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump avoided all questions about how the United States should shape its policy toward Russia on a visit to Moscow on Thursday. Carter Page said at a lecture he gave to students and business figures organized by Moscow\u2019s New Economic School that he did not want to comment on the U.S. election campaign. Page declined to say whether he was planning to meet anyone from the Kremlin, the Russian government or Foreign Ministry during his visit. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination for the U.S. presidential election, has made contradictory comments about Russia but made headlines with warm words for President Vladimir Putin.  Putin called Trump \u201cvery talented\u201d, fuelling speculation the Kremlin would be pleased to see Trump in the White House, but later rowed back from those comments. In his lecture on Thursday, Trump\u2019s adviser Page said Western governments had often had a hypocritical focus on democratization, corruption and inequality in the post-Soviet world. He also accused the United States and its partners of \u201cproactive steps to encourage regime change overseas\u201d. \u201cThis may understandably advance a certain level of insecurity,\u201d Page said. Relations between the United States and Russia have deteriorated sharply under U.S. leader Barack Obama, undermined by disagreements over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. The Obama administration imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 over Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region and fights on the opposing side of the five-year-old Syrian civil war.

        "text": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - About 20 asylum seekers on Friday left an Australian-run detention center due to close down in Papua New Guinea, but hundreds of holdouts faced forcible eviction amid an immigration standoff that has blighted Australia for years. Nearly 600 men have barricaded themselves into the Manus island center for more than 10 days without regular food or water, defying closure attempts by Australia and Papua New Guinea in what the United Nations calls a  looming humanitarian crisis . The deadline to move is Saturday. The asylum seekers fear reprisals if they move to transit centers pending possible resettlement in the United States. The main camp was closed on Oct. 31 and water and power have been cut off. Some locals are angry at what they perceive as preferential treatment for the asylum seekers, many of them well educated, in a poor, rural society, and some of the detainees have come under attack when on release from the camp.  Bowing to pressure from Papua New Guinea, which said it would forcibly evict and  apprehend  any holdouts on Saturday, around 20 men left the camp for one of the transit centers, three asylum seekers told Reuters. The rest vowed to stay put, setting the scene for a possible clash.  Volker Turk, assistant high commissioner for protection at U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, called on both governments to exercise restraint and not to use violence, taking into account people who had been in the processing center for years.  They re in a very vulnerable state with not much hope in sight,  he said.  We have been visiting Manus island several times over the last couple of years, we have reported on the very dire conditions in these centers. It s now really high time to bring an end to this unconscionable human suffering.   In Sydney, about 200 protesters picketed a fundraiser for the ruling Liberal Party, heckling arriving guests and demanding that the men be allowed to settle on the mainland. In Melbourne, more than 1,000 people held similar protests, the Australian Associated Press news agency said.   Australia has used the center, and a camp on the tiny Pacific island of Nauru, to detain asylum seekers who try to reach its shores by boat. It says boat arrivals will never enter Australia, even if found to be refugees, as this would encourage people smugglers in Asia. Australia says the policy prevents people drowning at sea, but it has been widely condemned.  We aren t going to be stood over by people that have better accommodation to move to,  Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said in a radio interview. The U.N. Human Rights Committee urged Australia to bring its migration laws into line with world standards. It is concerned about conditions in Manus and on Nauru, citing safety fears and instances of assault, sexual abuse, self-harm and suspicious deaths. The asylum seekers, drawn largely from Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Syria, use rubbish bins to collect rainwater and set up makeshift shelters to protect against the tropical sun and rain. Papua New Guinea police returned to dismantle parts of the camp on Friday, large parts of its fence having been removed the previous day.  They are destroying our shelters,  said Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran, detained for more than four years.  They destroyed the rubbish bins where we have been collecting water too.   ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON - Republican Ted Cruz on Friday denounced an article in the National Enquirer tabloid claiming he had extramarital affairs as \u201ccomplete and utter lies\u201d and accused rival Donald Trump of being the source of the story. The story took the Republican presidential race to a new level of personal rancor and Trump issued a statement saying he was not responsible for it. \u201cI have nothing to do with the National Enquirer and unlike Lyin\u2019 Ted Cruz I do not surround myself with political hacks and henchman and then pretend total innocence,\u201d Trump said. Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, addressed the Enquirer story at a news conference in Wisconsin, saying, \u201cLet me be clear. This National Enquirer story is garbage. It is complete and utter lies. It\u2019s tabloid smear and it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.\u201d Trump\u2019s statement pointed to other articles the Enquirer, a tabloid known for its gossip and unflattering celebrity photos, had been correct about in the past. \u201cTed Cruz\u2019s problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone, and while they were right about O.J. Simpson, John Edwards, and many others, I certainly hope they are not right about Lyin\u2019 Ted Cruz,\u201d the billionaire New York developer said. Trump and Cruz have sparred in recent days about their wives as they battle to be the Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 election. Earlier this week Trump accused Cruz of posting a nude photo of Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, on Twitter. Cruz denied having any role in the photo being circulated on the Internet and Trump responded by threatening to \u201cspill the beans\u201d on Cruz\u2019s wife. Cruz said the Enquirer story was evidence that Trump is unfit to be president. \u201cThis man would be an embarrassment,\u201d he said. The Enquirer published blurred images of five women with whom it said Cruz has had affairs but did not name them. Two women who appeared to be pictured in the Enquirer stepped forward on Friday and called the article false. The National Enquirer could not immediately be reached for comment on the story. Cruz\u2019 wife, Heidi Cruz, was campaigning with him on Friday and he gave her a hug and kiss before he began a town hall event. She sat off stage smiling while he spoke. This is not the first time a presidential candidate has been accused of extramarital sex. During the 1992 campaign, Gennifer Flowers came forward to detail an affair she had with Bill Clinton. Subsequently, more women admitted to having affairs with him, including then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Former Colorado Senator Gary Hart, a Democrat, had his 1988 presidential campaign derailed when reports surfaced that he was having an affair. Former North Carolina Senator John Edwards admitted to having an affair with a campaign photographer during his 2004 campaign, although the public did not learn about the romance until after he was defeated. The Enquirer\u2019s Cruz story exploded on the social media site Twitter overnight on Thursday. By Thursday afternoon, #CruzSexScandal was a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. ",

        "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey detained 136 people, including former police, teachers and soldiers, in four separate operations on Thursday over suspected links to last year s attempted military coup, the state-run Anadolu news agency said. Authorities detained 60 former security officials in the operation centered in the capital Ankara and spread over 30 provinces, Anadolu said. In a separate operation that began on Wednesday and centered on Diyarbakir and spread over 26 other provinces, 55 soldiers were detained, Anadolu said. Officials were still searching for one more suspect. Six others were detained in the northern provinces of Samsun and Karabuk, as well as 15 teachers in Ankara, Anadolu said. The suspects were alleged to be using the encrypted messaging app, ByLock, which the government says was used by the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Ankara blames Gulen, for orchestrating the failed coup in July 2016. Gulen has denied involvement and denounced the putsch. More than 50,000 people, including police, military personnel and civil servants, have been jailed pending trial in the aftermath of the July 2016 coup. Some 150,000 people were sacked or suspended. The crackdown has alarmed Turkey s Western allies and rights groups, who say President Tayyip Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to muzzle dissent. The government says the measures, taken under emergency rule that was imposed after the coup, are necessary due to the security threats Turkey faces. ",

To mark the opening Abdullah al-Thinni, prime minister of a government based in the east, arrived on board a tanker sent from the eastern city of Tobruk. The port does not export oil, but imports gas and some petroleum products as well as general cargo, and local costs for these would be reduced by the port s reopening, port spokesman Nasser Al-Maghrabi said.

Until now we have not received notification of tankers arriving for exports and imports - for now we are starting up and waiting.    Like Benghazi s airport, the port had been closed since 2014 because of a conflict between forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar and an alliance of Islamists and other opponents. Haftar declared victory in early July, though isolated skirmishes continued. Benghazi airport reopened in mid-July. ",

        "title": "Justice Department asks U.S. judge to reconsider ruling against Trump sanctuary order",
        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Monday asked a federal judge to reconsider a ruling which blocked President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to cut off federal funding for so-called sanctuary cities, citing a new memo from the attorney general. U.S. District Judge William Orrick III in San Francisco last month said Trump\u2019s order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional. The Republican president\u2019s moves on immigration have galvanized legal advocacy groups, along with Democratic city and state governments, to oppose them in court. The administration suffered an earlier defeat when two federal judges suspended executive orders restricting travel from several Muslim-majority countries. The government has appealed those decisions. The new filing comes in the wake of a memo released on Monday in which Attorney General Jeff Sessions formally endorsed a narrower interpretation of Trump\u2019s order, saying that the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs.  \u201cThe authoritative position set forth in the AG memorandum squarely contradicts the court\u2019s determination,\u201d DOJ lawyers wrote. In Orrick\u2019s original ruling against the Trump order, he cited comments by the president and Sessions which suggested the government intended to target a much wider swath of federal funds.    Sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing \u201csanctuary\u201d movement. Supporters of the sanctuary policy argue that enlisting police cooperation in rounding up immigrants for removal undermines communities\u2019 trust in local police, particularly among Latinos. The Trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. Santa Clara County, which includes the city of San Jose and several smaller Silicon Valley communities, sued in February, saying Trump\u2019s order was unconstitutional. San Francisco filed a similar lawsuit. ",

We do want to better our relations with Russia. However, the dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions.\u201d  Her remarks came amid speculation over U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s intentions towards Moscow. Trump has praised Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin and expressed a wish for improved relations between the two countries.  Haley made clear that tensions over the Ukraine would not end soon, including the matter of sanctions slapped on Russia related to the annexation of Crimea three years ago.      \u201cEastern Ukraine of course is not the only part of the country suffering because of Russia\u2019s aggressive actions. The United States continues to condemn and call for an immediate end to the Russian occupation of Crimea,\u201d Haley said.   \u201cCrimea is a part of Ukraine. Our Crimea related sanctions will remain in place until Russia returns control of the peninsula to Ukraine.\u201d The United States and other Western powers imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 over its annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine and its support for pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, disputed Haley\u2019s commentary on Crimea, but welcomed his American counterpart. \u201cIt was friendly enough, given the circumstances and given the subject we were discussing,\u201d the Russian ambassador told reporters.  He noted the chance for a new start after ties between Russia and United States frayed in Obama\u2019s second term. \u201cIf there is an opportunity to have better relations with the United States, if there is an opportunity for us to work better with the United States... then we should take this opportunity.\u201d  He faulted the Obama administration for not doing enough to end the conflict in Ukraine and called on the Trump government to bring its influence to bear.   \u201cClearly they are the people who are listened to in Kiev.\u201d Ukraine and Russia had blamed each other for a surge in fighting in recent days around the government-held industrial town of Avdiivka that has led to the highest casualty toll in weeks and cut off power and water to thousands of civilians on the front line. At the Thursday Security Council session, Ukraine\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Volodymr Yelchenko, who holds the presidency of the Security Council for February, said the strife around Avdiivka started with artillery shelling by the Russian army and Russian-backed fighters from the two suburbs they control abutting the town. Churkin blamed Ukrainian security forces for starting the bloodshed. U.N. under-secretary-general for political affairs, Jeffrey Feltman, painted a grim picture of the situation on the ground. \u201cHundreds of thousand of civilians on both sides of the contact line are still at risk of losing all access to water, heating and electricity, bringing the specter of further displacements closer,\u201d Feltman said.  \u201cWith every new day of fighting, the conflict becomes more entrenched and difficult to resolve. There is no military solution to this conflict.\u201d  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leaders of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee asked Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Friday to investigate any involvement of U.S. interrogators at secret prisons in Yemen where inmates have reportedly been tortured. The Associated Press published a report on Wednesday that nearly 2,000 men have disappeared into a secret network of prisons in Yemen run by the United Arab Emirates or Yemeni forces trained by the Gulf nation, where they have been abused and tortured. The UAE denied the allegations in a statement to AP. The AP report said U.S. forces have been involved in interrogations of detainees, citing senior American defense officials. The U.S. officials denied any participation in or knowledge of human rights abuses, but obtaining intelligence that may have been extracted by torture inflicted by another party would violate the International Convention Against Torture. Senators John McCain, the Senate committee\u2019s Republican chairman, and Jack Reed, its ranking Democrat, asked Mattis to conduct an immediate review of the alleged abuses, including of U.S. support to the forces involved. McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, has been a leader of anti-torture efforts in Congress. In the letter, he and Reed argued that any suggestion the United States is complicit in torture hurts national security. They also asked Mattis to assess what, if anything, U.S. forces knew about the alleged abuses and to provide a briefing to the committee as soon as possible. \u201cWe are confident that you find these allegations as extremely troubling as we do,\u201d McCain and Reed wrote.

        "title": "Legal challenge to UK ruling party's Northern Irish alliance fails",
        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - A London court on Thursday rejected a legal challenge against the deal between Britain s ruling Conservatives and a Northern Ireland party that allowed the government to cobble together a parliamentary majority in June. After losing their majority in a disastrous snap election on June 8, Prime Minister Theresa May s Conservatives secured support from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in return for a pledge to spend an extra 1 billion pounds in Northern Ireland. In a crowdfunded legal challenge brought by a Northern Irish citizen, lawyers argued that the deal, known as a confidence-and-supply agreement, was corrupt because it amounted to using public money to buy votes. But after a one-day hearing, the High Court rejected their arguments and denied permission for judicial review of the deal. The judges said neither of the grounds put forward against the deal was legally arguable. The challenge was launched by Ciaran McClean, a mental health worker and Green Party member living in Northern Ireland, who raised 92,000 pounds ($121,600) on a crowdfunding website and was present in court on Thursday. Lawyers acting for him told the court that  the Conservative Party purchased the political support of the DUP for the sum of 1 billion pounds  and that the deal was an offence under the Bribery Act 2010. Government lawyers responded that the public expenditure contemplated by the deal would be authorized by parliament, and that the criminal law of bribery did not apply to a confidence-and-supply agreement between political parties. On his fundraising page, McClean had written that the Conservative-DUP deal violated Northern Ireland s 1998 Good Friday peace agreement which ended decades of armed sectarian conflict in the province. Under the peace deal, the UK government is required to be impartial between unionists who want the province to remain part of the UK and republicans who aspire to become part of Ireland.  The government is threatening hard-won peace with their pact with the reactionary DUP,  McClean wrote. However, for technical legal reasons, that line of argument did not form part of the case heard by the High Court. May, who replaced David Cameron as prime minister after the Brexit referendum in June 2016, inherited a narrow parliamentary majority from him.  In April 2017, with opinion polls suggesting she had a double-digit lead over the opposition Labour Party, she called a snap election, hoping to increase her majority. But after an uninspiring campaign, they lost their majority. Support from the DUP s 10 members of parliament has enabled May to cling to power as Britain moves closer to the challenge of leaving the European Union. ",

The EU wants to have the main elements of a divorce agreement with Britain on the financial settlement, citizen s rights and the lack of a physical border between Northern Ireland and Ireland before it moves on to talks on a future trade agreement which is key for British-based businesses.

        "title": "Trump's low approval rating masks his support among likely voters: Reuters/Ipsos poll",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is more popular with likely voters than he is with the general public, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that underscores why Republican lawmakers have largely stuck with the polarizing president despite his plunging approval ratings. The poll, released on Wednesday, shows he polls better among people who voted in the 2016 presidential election than with the overall U.S. adult population \u2013 a group that includes both voters and non-voters. Only about 60 percent of the voting-age public took part in last year\u2019s election. In October, for example, 44 percent of 2016 voters said they approved of Trump\u2019s performance in office, compared with 37 percent of the general population. Among Republicans, 82 percent of voters approved of Trump in October, compared with 75 percent of all Republicans. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2zoIC1A) Some 85 percent of those who voted for Trump in 2016 said they would do so again, the poll found. The findings suggest that Republican candidates in the 2018 congressional elections who shun the president risk alienating his followers, Republican strategists and political scientists said. At the same time, those who embrace him in the early primary races that choose party candidates risk losing moderate voters in the general election. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for any Republican candidate to distance themselves from Trump,\u201d said Michael McDonald, an expert on voter turnout at the University of Florida.  That dilemma played out in Virginia on Tuesday, when Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate in the governor\u2019s race, was soundly beaten by his Democratic opponent. Gillespie had adopted some of Trump\u2019s hardline positions but had avoided campaigning with the unpopular president.  Gillespie\u2019s strategy had been closely watched within the party to see if it could provide a template for other Republican candidates in 2018, when control of the House of Representatives and the Senate will be up for grabs. Gillespie\u2019s loss sparked debate among Republicans on the way forward on Wednesday. Trump suggested in a tweet that the outcome could have been different had Gillespie fully embraced him, but critics pointed out that exit polls showed that a third of Virginian voters had turned out to signal displeasure with Trump, double the number who cast ballots to express support for the president.  Tuesday\u2019s results clearly signal that opposition to Trump has grown, even though he remains popular among 2016 Republican voters, said Elaine Kamarck, an expert in presidential politics at the Brookings Institution.  For Republicans, \u201cthe hurdle won\u2019t be with getting out the base,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cIt will be in getting anyone else to vote for you\u201d in elections where Republican voters are outnumbered. Reuters/Ipsos was able to compare the opinions of voters with the general public by creating two separate surveys: a poll of voters and a poll of the public.  For the voter poll, Reuters/Ipsos reconnected with people who took its exit poll on Nov. 8, 2016, the day of the U.S. presidential election. Those voters were sent additional questionnaires in May, July and October that asked if they approved or disapproved of the president.  Their responses were then compared with the results of a separate survey \u2013 the Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll \u2013 that surveys all adults in the United States. In May and July, the results of both polls were nearly identical, with about 40 percent of voters and the general adult population expressing approval for the president. The two polls diverged in October, however, with voters expressing stronger levels of approval than the general public.  Jan Leighley, an expert on political behavior at American University, said it makes sense that Trump is more popular among people who voted in the 2016 election. They were more likely to be white and less likely to identify with Democrats than the general public, she said.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English throughout the country. Some 1,206 of those 2016 voters took the  survey between May 10-12, followed by 1,296 who took the July 11-12 survey and 1,195 who took the survey between Oct. 18-19.\u00a0 Individual responses were weighted so they would reflect the latest population estimates, as well as the support their presidential pick received in the election. Each of the voter polls had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 5 percentage points for Republican voters. ",

        "text": "HAVANA (Reuters) - U.S. organizations that have worked closely with the outgoing Obama administration to improve relations with Cuba on Tuesday released a four-page letter to President-elect Donald Trump urging him not to act rashly toward the Communist-run nation. The Cuban Study Group, an organization of Cuban-American business leaders who favor engagement, and the Washington-based Engage Cuba coalition, arranged what they termed the \u201cmemo\u201d which says, \u201cto reflexively reverse course could have pernicious consequences for U.S. economic and foreign policy interests and the prospects of evolutionary change in Cuba.\u201d The Trump transition includes five Cuban-Americans who are vocal opponents of detente and have close ties to Cuban-American lawmakers who are calling for a return to pre-Obama efforts to isolate Cuba. A number of other Trump appointees have expressed hostility toward the Obama administration\u2019s two-year effort to normalize relations. \u201cWe are confident that a close evaluation will confirm that constructive engagement \u2014 including the reduction of travel and commercial barriers \u2014 is the best strategy for supporting the Cuban people and boosting U.S. jobs and exports,\u201d the signers of the report, which include the U.S.-Cuba Business Council, the National Foreign Trade Council, the American Society of Travel Agents and the Association of International Educators, say. They argue that the policy has improved human rights on the island, sped the expansion of internet access, led to dialogue on sensitive issues, improved national security and created jobs, among other positive results. The report follows the release last week of a similar plea by dozens of U.S. agricultural organizations which argued Cuba was an important market for their products. Trump, a Republican, has said he will dismantle the still-fragile detente unless Cuba gives the United States a better deal, while providing no specifics. He is expected to review the Cuba engagement on taking office on Friday. Trump has named Jason Greenblatt, a Trump Organization executive and chief legal counsel, as negotiator for sensitive international issues, including Cuba. The normalization of relations between the old Cold War foes has included restoration of diplomatic relations, Obama\u2019s historic trip to Cuba, the signing of 18 cooperation agreements and the use of executive orders to punch holes in the embargo, which can be lifted only by the U.S. Congress, now controlled by Republicans. Travel to the island from the United States has increased, with the start of direct flights and cruises and the signing of  cellphone roaming agreements, but no manufacturing or significant trade deals have been reached.

        "text": "WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - Republicans extended their majority of U.S. governorships on Tuesday as 12 states voted for chief executives, though the high-profile race in North Carolina was too close to call and the outcome may not be known until next week. Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper declared victory after gaining a razor-thin lead over incumbent Republican Governor Pat McCrory, who has been dogged by the backlash against a law he signed that restricts bathroom rights for transgender people and limits non-discrimination protections for gays and lesbians.  But McCrory told supporters early on Wednesday that the process of tallying an unknown number of provisional ballots could take until Nov. 18. \u201cThe election is not over in North Carolina,\u201d McCrory said. About 4,400 votes separated the candidates with all precincts reporting, according to unofficial election results from the state. The state extended voting times in eight Durham County precincts after problems with electronic voting rolls there earlier in the day. The county then uploaded about 90,000 early voting results late Tuesday, prompting concerns among Republicans as Cooper overtook McCrory in the ballot count. Elsewhere in the country, Republicans picked up seats in Missouri and Vermont in races that had been considered toss-ups. A winner had not been declared as of early Wednesday in the competitive race in New Hampshire. The outcomes of votes across the country were not expected, however, to dramatically alter the 31-18 advantage Republicans had over Democrats in the states\u2019 executive offices going into Election Day. Alaska has an independent governor.  Republican Lieutenant Governor Phil Scott clinched his victory in Vermont over Democrat Sue Minter, a former state transportation secretary, despite the state voting overwhelmingly for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race.  In West Virginia, where Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won by a landslide, billionaire businessman Jim Justice held on to the governor\u2019s seat for Democrats by beating Republican state Senate President Bill Cole. Republicans successfully defended the governorship in Indiana for a fourth straight term. Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb, who had trailed slightly in polls, won the race left open after Trump tapped Governor Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate. Pence offered his congratulations to Holcomb on Twitter, saying the governor-elect was \u201cthe leader who will keep our state moving forward.\u201d Republicans also celebrated in Kentucky, where they gained a majority in the state House of Representatives, the last Democratic-held chamber in the South. The takeover ended 95 years of a Democratic majority in that chamber. ",

        "title": "Exclusive: Trump's Afghan decision may increase U.S. air power, training",
        "text": "ON BOARD A U.S. MILITARY AIRCRAFT (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force may intensify its strikes in Afghanistan and expand training of the Afghan air force following President Donald Trump s decision to forge ahead with the 16-year-old war, its top general told Reuters on Tuesday. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein said, however, he was still examining the matter, as the U.S. military s top brass had only begun the process of translating Trump s war strategy into action. Asked whether the Air Force would dedicate more assets to Afghanistan, where the United States has been engaged in its longest military conflict, Goldfein said only:  Possibly.    It s actually too early to tell what this will mean in terms of plus-ups and reductions,  he said in a joint interview with Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson. Still, he acknowledged that the Air Force was  absolutely  examining the possibility of increasing air power, including to support U.S. ground forces, following Trump s promise of a stepped-up campaign against Taliban insurgents, who have gained ground against U.S.-backed Afghan government forces.  Goldfein said the same about providing training to Afghan pilots. Wilson, who assumed the Air Force s top civilian job three months ago, noted the Afghan military had made strides thanks to U.S. training and equipment, but added:  I think there is a long way to go there, very honestly.   In a speech on Monday night, Trump appeared to answer a call from the top U.S. commander on the ground for thousands of more troops to break a stalemate with Taliban insurgents, on top of the roughly 8,400 now deployed in Afghanistan. Trump said the United States would not disclose troop numbers, but one U.S. official told Reuters they could start moving quickly. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday he would set troop levels following the review by military chiefs. During the administration of Trump s predecessor, Barack Obama, U.S. military officials privately expressed frustration about their inability to strike at many Taliban targets - including training camps -  unless they could show a direct threat to U.S. forces or major impact on the Afghan state. Wilson said Trump appeared to be giving greater flexibility to strike insurgents.     Obviously the Joint Chiefs will work through their plans and make proposals, but I think the guidance was pretty clear from the president last night, and we re going to go on the offensive and destroy these terrorist networks,  Wilson said.  Goldfein said:  I thought that came out very loud and clear in the speech that that s his priority.  Wilson and Goldfein spoke to Reuters while flying back to the United States after a nine-day trip that included a visit to Afghanistan, where the U.S. military has ramped up its firepower against Islamic State in recent months even as it helps Afghan forces battle the Taliban.   Particularly for the U.S. Air Force, the size of the American commitment to Afghanistan far outweighs the number of airmen deployed there. A network of U.S. installations throughout the Middle East supports the Afghan campaign, including in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.  Still, any substantial increase in U.S. targeting of the Taliban and Islamic State militants would likely require dedicating more U.S. military assets to build intelligence, strike insurgent targets and provide support to U.S. forces in the field. Although the U.S. military is stretched, a string of U.S. coalition-backed victories by Iraqi forces against Islamic State might free up some firepower and intelligence assets for Afghanistan, experts say. Air Force spokesman Brigadier General Edward Thomas declined to speculate on operational planning. But he noted that U.S. air power from the region could be deployed, if needed, including fighter aircraft, bombers and spy planes.     With the detailed planning that will follow the president s announcement, the Air Force will be ready to swing any additional airmen and aircraft to the fight as required,   Thomas said.  Trump ran for the presidency calling for a swift U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which the United States invaded in October 2001, and he acknowledged on Monday that he was going against his instincts in approving the new campaign plan sought by his military advisers. Wilson said Trump s remarks represented a  strategic correction  in the war effort along with a significant shift in policy on Pakistan. In his speech, Trump delivered a sharp rebuke to Islamabad for allowing Taliban insurgents a safe haven from which launch attacks in Afghanistan, and said it had  much to lose  unless it changed course. Pakistan denies that it harbors militants fighting U.S. and Afghan government forces in Afghanistan. Reuters has reported that the United States has been considering a range of actions, including withholding aid to Pakistan and, perhaps, ramping up drone strikes. Successive U.S. administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear-armed Pakistan, and the U.S. military has been dependent in the past on overflight or land routes through Pakistan to resupply its forces in landlocked Afghanistan.   Wilson did not rule out a future U.S. military role against militants in Pakistan should Islamabad fail to act, but she said Trump s focus appeared to be on diplomatic efforts for now.   My assumption is that there will be some intense diplomatic pressure,  she said. Goldfein said he was not aware of any changes to U.S.-Pakistani military ties, but acknowledged the military would take its cues from the State Department.  I can tell you that I have a fairly robust dialogue with the Pakistani air chief. I ve hosted him. He s hosted me,  Goldfein said.  But that dialogue is always supportive of the diplomatic dialogue.   ",

        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - A powerful explosion in a Chinese city south of Shanghai brought down buildings in a neighborhood marked for demolition, killing at least two people, state television reported on Sunday. The explosion struck at around 8:50 a.m. (0050 GMT) in Jiangbei district in the port city of Ningbo in Zhejiang province, China Central Television (CCTV) reported. Police said the cause of the blast was still uncertain.  A  huge tremor  was felt in the vicinity when it hit, CGTN, a network operated by CCTV, wrote on Twitter.  The force of the explosion destroyed the roofs of two buildings at the site of the blast, which CCTV said were already structurally unsound.  It also shattered windows and punched holes in the walls of some residential and commercial properties as far as a kilometer away.  Images from CCTV also showed a few flattened cars and a low-rise building with a collapsed wall.  The state broadcaster said two people were killed, while 16 were slightly wounded and two were in serious condition. CCTV said the blast was not a gas explosion, as the gas pipelines beneath the ground were no longer active, citing the operator of the pipelines.  According to local Zhejiang Daily, the buildings that collapsed had already been cleared of people. Police told Reuters the area had been marked for demolition. The official People s Daily posted aerial photographs of firefighters working at the site of the blast - an open area of debris and broken concrete.  The newspaper said there were no residents at the site of the explosion, though there might have been rubbish collectors at work when the blast occurred.  Another photograph posted by People s Daily showed grey smoke rising over the skyline of the city of Ningbo, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Shanghai.  Earlier in the day, the official agency Xinhua news agency said the blast had happened at a factory.  Rescue work and an investigation into the cause were under way, local police said on Weibo.  Blasts and other accidents are common in China due to patchy enforcement of safety rules, although the government has pledged to improve checks to try to stamp out such incidents.  ",

        "title": "German election campaign largely unaffected by fake news or bots",
        "text": "BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany is on guard against any last-minute meddling in  Sunday s election but experts have seen only isolated attempts to swing votes during the campaign. There are also no signs that fake news will affect the outcome of the election, which Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats are expected to win. The broadly clean bill of health from political experts and social media watchers is in contrast to the U.S. and French presidential elections of the past 12 months, in which Russia was accused of trying to influence the outcome. (For a graphic on German federal elections click tmsnrt.rs/2h0NqCT)   People generally aren t expecting a huge amount of digital meddling because in the end it didn t work in France, and it s just too closely associated with Russia. It would hurt them (Russia),  said Sergey Lagodinsky, a lawyer and researcher with a Green Party-connected think tank in Berlin. The sharing of false or misleading headlines and mass posting by automated social media  bots  have had little influence in Germany s quiet campaign, government officials and political experts say. And an Oxford University study concluded this week that far less fake news was being spread in Germany than in the United States before the 2016 presidential election. Concern had been raised in Germany by the accusations of Russian meddling in last year s U.S. presidential election to prevent Democrat Hilary Clinton winning and in this year s French presidential election, in which eventual winner Emmanuel Macron s team complained his campaign was targeted by a  massive and coordinated  hacking operation. Russia has denied meddling in foreign elections. FAR-RIGHT SET TO ENTER PARLIAMENT Germany s biggest political parties, worried about the impact of a hack that stole politicians  data in 2015, agreed this year not to exploit any information that might be leaked as a result of a cyber attack, and not to use bots. Social media watchers spotted a small-scale effort late in the campaign by Russian accounts on Twitter to amplify a call by German far-right activists for their supporters to volunteer as observers at polls to prevent possible voting fraud. The far-right call for election monitors centered on a site with a tiny following called wahlbeobachtung.de, which features demands for a recount if many invalid ballots are found. It was retweeted by a Russian  bot-for-hire  169 times in recent days, fake news tracking site Digital Forensic Research Labs said. The site, run by EinProzent (One Percent), an anti-immigrant, anti-Merkel  patriotic citizens  network , has drawn just 305 Facebook users to sign up as monitors so far. German voters will cast votes at some 88,000 polling stations. Of 1 million tweets tracked by the Oxford group in the first 10 days of September, 30 percent were tied to the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD), far outweighing support shown for the party in polls: it is running at around 10 percent. That puts the AfD on track to enter parliament for the first time as the third largest party.  Facebook Germany spokesman Klaus Gorny said the company was keeping a close eye on abuse while sticking to its principles of allowing free speech.  He said there was no doubt that right-wing postings, some of them quite offensive, had increased, but Facebook was only removing content that was illegal.   There are certainly things that are completely off, but they re not illegal,  he said.  ",

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - An 18-year-old man who came to Britain after his parents were killed in Iraq appeared in a London court on Friday charged with attempted murder in last week s bomb attack on a packed commuter train in the British capital. Ahmed Hassan is accused of carrying out the attack at Parsons Green station in London on Friday which injured 30 people. Wearing a gray sweatshirt and with shoulder-length curly dark hair, he spoke only to confirm his name and address at London s Westminster Magistrates  Court. Hassan, from Sunbury-on-Thames, a town to the southwest of London, is charged with attempting to murder passengers on board a train heading to central London from the southwest suburb of Wimbledon. He is also accused of causing an explosion likely to endanger life using the highly volatile triacetone triperoxide (TATP) - known as  the mother of Satan  - or another explosive substance. Prosecutor Lee Ingham told the court Hassan had expressed hatred for Britain and his  warped view  had motivated him to carry out the attack. There was no application for bail and the case was adjourned until Oct. 13. The home-made bomb engulfed a carriage in flames, but apparently failed to fully explode. It was Britain s fifth major militant attack so far this year. Police are continuing to question two other men, aged 25 and 30. A 17-year-old, who was detained on Thursday, was released on Friday and will face no further action. Two other men, arrested as part of the inquiry, were also released from custody on Thursday. ",

        "title": "More groups challenge Trump's latest travel ban in court",
        "text": "NEW York (Reuters) - Muslim immigrants and an advocacy group filed a fresh lawsuit against President Donald Trump\u2019s latest version of a travel ban that placed indefinite restrictions on the entry of citizens from eight countries to the United States. The suit filed late Monday in federal court in Maryland challenges a Sep. 24 Presidential proclamation limiting travel from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea. Certain government officials from Venezuela were also barred. Six individual plaintiffs who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents with Iranian relatives who could be blocked from coming to the United States, along with the group Iranian Alliances Across Borders, claim the ban violates an immigration law that prevents discrimination based on nationality.  The complaint says that the majority of the people affected by the ban are Muslim and point to Trump\u2019s campaign promises for \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d The suit says North Korea and Venezuela were added so Trump could \u201ccloak this latest iteration of his Muslim ban in religiously neutral garb by invoking a national security review.\u201d   The latest ban goes fully into effect on Oct. 18 and could affect tens of thousands of potential immigrants and visitors. Trump has argued that the restrictions are necessary to tighten security and prevent terrorist attacks. Department of Justice spokesman Ian Prior said the agency \u201cwill continue to vigorously defend the President\u2019s inherent authority to keep this country safe.\u201d Trump\u2019s proclamation followed on two earlier temporary travel bans against some of the same countries, after the government did a global review of information sharing and security screening protocols. The first ban issued soon after Trump took office in January targeted seven countries but was blocked by courts following a hasty implementation and chaotic scenes at airports. The second ban signed in March targeted six countries and was also blocked by lower courts. It was then partially revived by the Supreme Court in June. The third ban, with no clear end date, came out when the temporary measures expired. On Friday the American Civil Liberties Union said it was seeking to amend an existing lawsuit in Maryland federal court filed against the previous March 6 ban to include the latest proclamation.  Legal experts say the new restrictions are likely on more solid footing, in part because they followed a detailed review by federal agencies. ",

        "title": "Republicans unveil tax cut bill, but the hard work awaits",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Republicans unveiled long-delayed legislation on Thursday to deliver deep tax cuts that President Donald Trump has promised, setting off a frantic race in Congress to give him his first major legislative victory. The 429-page bill, representing what would be the largest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the 1980s, called for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, cutting tax rates on individuals and families and ending certain tax breaks for companies and individuals. Congressional passage of this legislation that would affect nearly every U.S. company and family was far from certain, and some business groups quickly came out against it. Contentious provisions will test Republicans, who control the White House and both chambers of Congress but have been unable to deliver any major legislative achievements for Trump since the businessman-turned-politician became president in January. A number of provisions would hit taxpayers in Democratic-leaning states hardest, like rolling back deductions for state and local taxes and cutting in half the popular mortgage interest deduction.  The legislation, called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, produces new advantages for rich Americans through lowered corporate taxes, phasing out the estate tax and dumping the alternative minimum tax.  \u201cThis is a very important and special moment for our country, for all Americans. Are we going to let the defenders of the status quo win and see our country continue down this downward spiral?\u201d Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan asked, despite data showing about eight straight years of economic growth. Meeting with Ryan and other key House Republicans, Trump told the lawmakers he was counting on them to maintain the momentum for tax cuts, and repeated his request that Congress send him the legislation to sign into law by the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23. That is an ambitious timetable for such a long, multi-faceted piece of legislation that will face a ferocious lobbying battle among business sectors affected by the bill and fierce opposition from many Democrats. Trump called the bill an \u201cimportant step\u201d toward tax relief for Americans, adding in a statement, \u201cWe are just getting started, and there is much work left to do.\u201d The bill presented by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee would consolidate the current number of tax brackets to four from seven: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. An earlier Republican tax outline had called for cutting the top rate for the highest earners to 35 percent. The National Association of Home Builders blasted the legislation, saying it would damage home prices and punish homeowners in urban areas.  \u201cWe\u2019re concerned if enacted, this bill will throw us back into another housing recession,\u201d Jerry Howard, the group\u2019s president, said in an interview. The group said the provision in the bill capping the interest deduction for future home purchases at $500,000 - half the current amount - was unacceptable. Howard said 7 million homes are currently above $500,000 and in high-cost regions like Washington, D.C., New York City, California and Hawaii, the impact would be felt the most.  The bill would repeal the existing deduction for state and local income and sales taxes, and would cap the deduction for state and local property taxes at $10,000. Those provisions would most affect Americans in higher-tax states such as California, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Illinois. The National Federation of Independent Business, the influential small business lobby, also came out against the bill, while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobby backed it. Ryan said the typical family of four would save $1,182 annually on taxes under the bill.  With Democrats solidly opposed to legislation they see as a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would expand the federal deficit, Republicans can ill afford to lose many in their own ranks as they aim to pass the bill in the coming weeks. \u201cUltimately, what the American people really get from this tax plan is a huge bill for the debt incurred to pay for tax breaks that line the pockets of Donald Trump personally along with his billionaire buddies. Like a Trump University degree, it is phony,\u201d said Democratic congressman Lloyd Doggett. The bill\u2019s architects avoided one showdown by deciding not to make changes to the popular tax-deferred 401(k) retirement savings program. The bill would roughly double the standard deduction for individuals and families. But it would repeal a personal exemption of $4,050 that taxpayers can currently claim for themselves, their spouse and any dependents. The legislation would also phase out tax-exempt financing for sports stadiums and subject large private universities to 1.4-percent excise tax on investment income. It would also repeal a long standing prohibition on religious institutions being involved in political activities. The bill would create a new family tax credit and double exemptions for estate taxes on inherited assets, while also allowing small businesses to write off loan interest. The bill would cap the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non-corporate enterprises at 25 percent, down from the present maximum rate on \u201cpass-through\u201d income of 39.6 percent. It would set standards for distinguishing between individual wage income and actual pass-through business income to prevent tax-avoidance abuse of the new, lower tax level. It would create a new 10-percent tax on U.S. companies\u2019 high-profit foreign subsidiaries, calculated on a global basis, in a move to prevent companies from moving profits overseas. Foreign businesses operating in the United States would face a tax of up to 20 percent on payments they make overseas from their American operations. U.S. equities have rallied in 2017 to a series of record highs, partly on expectations of deep corporate tax cuts. Shares of U.S. homebuilders fell after the bill was released, with luxury homebuilders including Toll Brothers taking the biggest hit. As investors parsed its provisions, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up modestly and the S&P 500 was down slightly. Investors cautioned the tax plan was preliminary and it was too soon to gauge the effect on specific industries. [nL2N1N81IG] The Ways and Means Committee will begin formal consideration of the bill next week before the full House can vote on it. It also must pass the Senate, where Republicans hold a slimmer 52-48 majority and earlier this year failed to garner enough votes to approve a major healthcare overhaul sought by Trump. ",

        "title": "Kerry urges Congress not to rush to renew Iran sanctions measure",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of State John Kerry urged Congress on Thursday not to rush to renew the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA), a broad U.S. law imposing sanctions over Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile programs that expires at the end of the year. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t advise that for a number of reasons,\u201d Kerry told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee at a hearing on the State Department\u2019s budget. Many lawmakers have been pushing to renew the ISA quickly, to send a message to Tehran that Congress is still taking a hard line over its nuclear program, missile development and human rights record. The effort could set up another showdown over Iran between the administration and the Republicans who control Congress. Every Republican in Congress, and several of President Barack Obama\u2019s fellow Democrats, opposed the agreement announced in July in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. House Republicans early this month passed legislation to restrict Obama\u2019s ability to lift sanctions under the nuclear pact. The Senate has not taken it up and Obama has threatened a veto, and lawmakers are discussing alternatives. \u201cIf the administration isn\u2019t supportive of this renewal (of the ISA), not only are we preventing the possibility of a snapback, but from the standpoint of myself and many of the members of this committee, we\u2019re also giving relief on missiles,\u201d said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican committee chairman. Iran tested ballistic missile technology in October, prompting the United States to impose new sanctions in January, but many members of Congress want a stronger response. Kerry said lawmakers should allow more time to see how Iran responds to the international nuclear agreement, which went into effect only last month. He argued that sanctions can be imposed quickly if Iran is found to violate terms of the nuclear deal or other agreements. Kerry was asked about reports that Iran will enjoy a windfall of up to $150 billion from the nuclear agreement as money frozen under the sanctions regime is released. He said the total likely would be about one-third of that level, and currently is far lower. \u201cOur estimates are it\u2019s somewhere in the vicinity of $50 to $55 billion at some point in time but it\u2019s way below that right now.\u201d Kerry said. \u201cAnd in fact, they are complaining about the slowness with which there has been a process of repatriation.\u201d ",

        "title": "Trump urges adding anti-Obamacare provision to tax bill: lawmaker",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing Republicans to change their tax-cut bill to include a repeal of the Obamacare mandate that requires individuals to buy health insurance or pay a fine, the House of Representative\u2019s top tax lawmaker said on Friday. House tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he has asked the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to assess Trump\u2019s suggestion and indicated some lawmakers were considering it. Other lawmakers have expressed concern. They said adding such a divisive provision would expose the tax bill to the fierce opposition that doomed Republicans\u2019 efforts in July to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. The act was former President Barack Obama\u2019s biggest domestic achievement. It raised taxes on wealthier Americans to fund healthcare benefits for middle- and low-income people, extending coverage to millions of previously uninsured. Democrats have defended it for years from attacks by Republicans, who see it as Washington intruding on Americans\u2019 healthcare. Since Trump took power in January, he has pressed hard to undo much of Obama\u2019s work. So far he has not secured any major legislative accomplishments in Congress, even though Republicans control both the House and the Senate. \u201cThe president feels very strongly about including this (the individual mandate repeal) at some step before the final process. He\u2019s told me that twice by phone and once in person,\u201d Brady told an event hosted by the news outlet Politico. \u201cNo decisions have been made ... Importing healthcare into a tax reform debate has consequences,\u201d Brady said. Trump broached his idea in a tweet earlier this week, saying it would be \u201cgreat\u201d to repeal the mandate \u201cand use those savings for further tax cuts.\u201d Some Republican senators, such as Tom Cotton and Rand Paul, also favor this idea. Representative Tom Cole, a senior House Republican, said Friday that adding on a mandate repeal could cost the tax bill votes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to overload the vehicle,\u201d Cole told reporters, adding that including the mandate repeal would probably be a \u201cdeal breaker\u201d for Democrats. Brady also said Friday he would offer \u201csubstantive improvements\u201d to the tax bill when his committee begins considering the legislation next week. He gave no details. The tax bill released Thursday would cut tax rates for businesses, individuals and families. Republicans hope to pass it through Congress by year\u2019s end. Democrats oppose it as a give-away to the rich and large corporations. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate committee on Tuesday held the first congressional hearing in more than four decades on the president\u2019s authority to launch a nuclear strike, amid concern that tensions over North Korea\u2019s weapons program could lead to war. Senator Bob Corker, Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, held the hearing as President Donald Trump wrapped up a 12-day trip to Asia largely dominated by concerns about Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Corker acknowledged that senators, including Democrats and Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, have raised questions about Trump\u2019s authority to wage war, use nuclear weapons and enter into or end international agreements. Trump has traded insults and threats with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un and used expressions like \u201cfire and fury\u201d to hint that any use of lethal force against North Korea would be overwhelming. On Sunday, he again insulted Kim by calling him \u201cshort and fat.\u201d Corker himself warned last month that Trump might be putting the United States \u201con the path to World War Three.\u201d But on Tuesday Corker said the hearing was not intended to target Trump. \u201cThis is not specific to anybody,\u201d he said. Democrats made clear they were concerned about Trump. \u201cWe are concerned that the president of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic, that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with U.S. national security interests,\u201d Senator Chris Murphy said. During the hearing, retired General Robert Kehler, former commander of U.S. Strategic Command, said the military can refuse to follow what it considers an illegal order, even a nuclear one. But it was not clear after questions from committee members how that process would work. Some senators want legislation to alter the president\u2019s nuclear authority. Corker said he did not now support that idea. \u201cI do not see a legislative solution today, but that doesn\u2019t mean that over the course of the next several months one might develop,\u201d he told reporters after the hearing. Some senators seemed to bristle about the hearing\u2019s tone, warning against comments depicting Trump as unable to strongly retaliate for any attack. \u201cEvery single word that has been uttered this morning at this hearing is going to be analyzed in Pyongyang,\u201d said Republican Senator Jim Risch, who is in line to become chairman after Corker retires next year.

        "title": "Trump and Christie join forces to attack Obama, Clinton",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans Donald Trump and Chris Christie teamed up on Monday to assail Democratic President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as weak on domestic security, making the kind of one-two punch possible if Trump picks Christie as his running mate. At a rally in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and Christie, the tough-talking New Jersey governor, seized on the Dallas police shootings as examples of why Americans need a \u201claw and order\u201d candidate like Trump. Much of the debate about security in the presidential campaign has been about threats abroad. The shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers last week and violence in other cities have shifted the debate back home for now. Trump, a wealthy real estate developer, presented himself as \u201cthe law and order candidate\u201d and called Clinton weak. He said she has grown out of touch with the plight of ordinary Americans and cited her making paid speeches to corporate interests as a cause. \u201cPerhaps it is easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions of dollars to read speeches to Wall Street executives, instead of spending time with real people in real pain,\u201d he said. \u201cThe disconnect in America is deep. There are two Americas: the ruling class, and the groups it favors, and then everyone else,\u201d said Trump. In the final days of his search for a vice presidential running mate, Trump was introduced at the event by Christie, who is one of Trump\u2019s top potential picks to be his vice presidential running mate. Christie, a former rival of Trump for the presidential nomination, showed himself capable of assuming the role of political attack dog, a job the vice presidential nominee usually assumes. He suggested Obama has taken sides against police in the country\u2019s debate over race and police brutality. \u201cWe need a president who once again will put law and order at the top of the priority of the presidency of this country,\u201d Christie said. \u201cOur police officers ... need to understand that the president of the United States and his administration will give them the benefit of the doubt, not always believe that what they have done is somehow wrong.\u201d Trump has been test-driving his vice presidential possibilities. He campaigned last week with former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, and is to appear with a third No. 2 possibility, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, in Indiana on Tuesday. The New York businessman has appeared most comfortable publicly with Gingrich. Both Gingrich and Christie have been advisers for Trump behind the scenes. Trump is also considering retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn for the job, but told The Washington Post in an interview published on Monday that he is leaning toward a conventional politician. \u201cI don\u2019t need two anti-establishment people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSomeone respected by the establishment and liked by the establishment would be good for unification. I do like unification of the Republican Party.\u201d Trump said he would decide on his vice presidential pick in the next three or four days. The Republican National Convention, at which he is to be nominated as the party\u2019s candidate, opens in Cleveland next Monday.

        "text": "AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan has begun consultations on convening an emergency meeting of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation before an expected move this week by U.S. President Donald Trump to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, a senior Jordanian source said.   A senior U.S. administration official said on Friday that Trump was likely to make the controversial declaration in a speech on Wednesday. Recognizing Jerusalem would upend decades of American policy and possibly inflame tensions in the Middle East. Jordan, the current president of the Arab summit, would invite members of the two bodies to convene if the recognition is extended, to  discuss ways of dealing with the consequences of such a decision that raised alarm and concern , the senior Jordanian diplomatic source told Reuters.  It could ultimately hamper all efforts to get the peace process moving and would certainly be provocative to Arab and Muslim countries and Muslim communities across the West,  said the source, asking not to be named.  No issue can move Arabs and Muslims in the same potent way as Jerusalem does.       King Abdullah s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Amman sensitive to any changes of status of the disputed city. Officials are worried the move could trigger violence in the Palestinian territories and a spillover into Jordan, a country where many people are descendants of Palestinian refugees whose families left after the creation of Israel in 1948.  A tremendous wave of anger will spread across the Arab and Muslim world,  said another regional diplomatic source in touch with U.S. officials on the issue. Tensions in Jerusalem s Al Aqsa compound, the third holiest site in Islam, earlier this year provoked days of unrest.  Word of Trump s planned announcement, which would deviate from the line taken by previous U.S. presidents who insisted Jerusalem s status must be decided in negotiations, drew criticism from the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and the international community does not recognize Israel s claim on all of the city, home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions.     Jordan lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank to Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and says the city s fate should only be decided only at the end of a final settlement.   King Abdullah warned of the repercussions of Trump s expected move in talks this week in Washington with top administration officials.  Trump suggested earlier this year he was open to new ways to achieve Middle East peace that did not necessarily entail the creation of a Palestinian state, a hallmark of U.S. policy for decades.  If it happens (recognition of Jerusalem) it will jeopardize all efforts towards stability and peace in the region and thwart a resolution of the conflict,  the regional diplomatic source said.  ",

        "title": "White House looking at ethics rule to weaken special investigation: sources",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is exploring whether it can use an obscure ethics rule to undermine the special counsel investigation into ties between President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign team and Russia, two people familiar with White House thinking said on Friday. Trump has said that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2019s hiring of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation \u201churts our country terribly.\u201d  Within hours of Mueller\u2019s appointment on Wednesday, the White House began reviewing the Code of Federal Regulations, which restricts newly hired government lawyers from investigating their prior law firm\u2019s clients for one year after their hiring, the sources said.  An executive order signed by Trump in January extended that period to two years. Mueller\u2019s former law firm, WilmerHale, represents Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who met with a Russian bank executive in December, and the president\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who is a subject of a federal investigation. Legal experts said the ethics rule can be waived by the Justice Department, which appointed Mueller. He did not represent Kushner or Manafort directly at his former law firm. If the department did not grant a waiver, Mueller would be barred from investigating Kushner or Manafort, and this could  greatly diminish the scope of the probe, experts said. The Justice Department is already reviewing Mueller\u2019s background as well as any potential conflicts of interest, said department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores. Even if the Justice Department granted a waiver, the White House would consider using the ethics rule to create doubt about Mueller\u2019s ability to do his job fairly, the sources said. Administration legal advisers have been asked to determine if there is a basis for this.  Under this strategy, the sources said the administration would raise the issue in press conferences and public statements. Moreover, the White House has not ruled out the possibility of using the rule to challenge Mueller\u2019s findings in court, should the investigation lead to prosecution.  But the administration is now mainly focused on placing a cloud over his reputation for independence, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.      Kathleen Clark, a professor of legal ethics at Washington University School of Law, said the Justice Department can grant a waiver if concerns about bias are minimal.  She said subjects of the investigation could later argue that its results cannot be trusted, but she believes the argument would not stand up in court.   The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether it is reviewing the ethics rule in order to undermine Mueller\u2019s credibility.  Mueller\u2019s former colleagues at WilmerHale, James Quarles and Aaron Zebley, are expected to join his investigation, according to a spokeswoman for the law firm. Neither Quarles nor Zebley represented Kushner or Manafort.  Mueller will now lead the ongoing Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into Trump\u2019s associates and senior Russian officials.  Unlike Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel appointed by a three-judge panel to investigate Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s real estate holdings in the 1990s, Mueller depends on the Justice Department for funding and he reports to Rosenstein, who was appointed by Trump.  When he announced Mueller\u2019s appointment this week, Rosenstein said Mueller will have \u201call appropriate resources to conduct a thorough and complete investigation.\u201d ",

        "title": "U.S. Labor Department rescinds Obama-era rule on 'joint employment'",
        "text": "(Reuters) - The U.S. Labor Department on Wednesday said it was rescinding the Obama administration\u2019s standard for determining when companies are \u201cjoint employers\u201d of contract and franchise workers, in the agency\u2019s first major shift in labor policy under President Donald Trump. The department in a statement said it had withdrawn a 2016 interpretation of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that expanded the circumstances under which a business could be held liable for wage-law violations by staffing agencies, contractors, and franchisees. Previously, companies were considered joint employers when they hired and fired workers and set wages. The Obama administration said a worker\u2019s level of \u201ceconomic dependence\u201d on a company should also be considered. The expanded definition of joint employment had rankled the business community, which said it threatened the franchise business model and would draw companies into lawsuits when they were not responsible for setting working conditions.  Also on Wednesday, the department withdrew 2015 guidance that said that under the same law, many workers are improperly treated as independent contractors when they are actually employees, which would make them eligible for minimum wage, overtime, and other legal protections.  Guidance issued by federal agencies is not legally binding, but serves as a blueprint for how agencies will enforce federal laws. A shift in enforcement priorities at the Department of Labor had been widely expected since President Donald Trump, a Republican and wealthy businessman from New York, took office.  Business groups have said the department\u2019s guidance on employment and worker classification was misguided and affected nearly every U.S. industry, and they praised the agency\u2019s changes on Wednesday. \u201cDiligent employers work hard to be compliant with the FLSA and these (department) interpretations were merely enforcement traps waiting to spring,\u201d Randy Johnson, a vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. Unions and workers\u2019 rights groups said they were troubled by the labor department\u2019s decision. \u201cThis was guidance that made it easier for employers, workers, unions and others to know about their rights and obligations under the law,\u201d Lynn Rhinehart, general counsel for the AFL-CIO, said in a statement. The withdrawal of the guidance does not affect a separate expansion of the definition of joint employment by the National Labor Relations Board, which is under review by a federal appeals court. The NLRB\u2019s standard has had more of an impact than the labor department\u2019s because it is legally binding and requires joint employers to bargain with unions. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. Senate were dealt another blow in their effort to repeal Obamacare on Friday when the keeper of the Senate\u2019s rules said certain provisions in their healthcare bill, such as defunding Planned Parenthood, could not be included. The Senate parliamentarian determined some provisions in the Better Care Reconciliation Act violate the Byrd Rule that requires backers to be able to muster 60 votes, according to a memo posted on the Senate Committee on the Budget website. Republicans, who control the Senate with a slim 52-seat majority, are unlikely to be able to round up that many votes for key provisions in the bill to repeal former President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare.     Affected would be the provision to defund Planned Parenthood, two provisions to prevent certain tax credits from being used to purchase health insurance that covers abortion, and a provision stating that beginning in 2020 states no longer have to cover essential health benefits in their Medicaid alternative benefit plans. Some provisions were not subject to the Byrd Rule, according to the parliamentarian, including a provision allowing states the option to impose work requirements on Medicaid enrollees who are not disabled, elderly or pregnant, and a proposal to repeal cost-sharing subsidies. Other provisions were still under review, including a proposal to allow insurers to charge older Americans more than younger people, a provision to allow small businesses to establish \u201cassociation health plans\u201d that could be sold across state lines and the option for states to receive Medicaid \u201cblock grant\u201d lump sums instead of per capita cap payments.

        "text": "MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he had made significant progress on trade issues during a fruitful trip across Asia that saw governments roll out red carpets  like nobody has ever seen .  We ve made some very big steps with respect to trade, far bigger than anything you know,  Trump told reporters in Manila on the sidelines of a summit with leaders of Southeast Asian and East Asian nations. He did not give details of his achievements on trade matters during a tour that took him to Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam before his last leg in the Philippines capital. He said a statement would be issued from the White House on Wednesday about North Korea, and on trade, key issues of a trip he described as fruitful.  It was red carpet like nobody, I think, has probably ever seen,  he said. In Vietnam at the weekend, Trump and leaders of Pacific Rim nations agreed to address  unfair trade practices  and  market- distorting subsidies , a statement that bore the imprint of Trump s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape. His  America First  vision has upset a traditional consensus favoring multinational trade pacts that China now champions. On the sidelines of the Vietnam meeting, 11 countries kept alive a Trans Pacific trade deal whose future was thrown into doubt when Trump withdrew from it in the name of protecting American jobs. Chinese President Xi Jinping told the summit in Vietnam that Asia-Pacific nations must  uphold multilateralism , countering Trump s message that the United States would stay out of trade deals that surrender its sovereignty. Trump, by contrast, blasted the World Trade Organization and multilateral trade deals during his tour. Some analysts expect tougher U.S. action may be imminent to fight trade imbalances with China exacerbated by its state-led economic model.    ",

        "title": "More arrests in apparent Saudi campaign against critics: activists",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has detained more clerics and intellectuals, activists said on social media on Tuesday, widening an apparent crackdown on potential opponents of the conservative kingdom s absolute rulers. The crackdown comes amid widespread speculation, denied by officials, that King Salman intends to abdicate in favor of his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who already dominates economic, diplomatic and domestic policy. It also comes amid a deepening rift between Saudi Arabia and its allies on one side and Qatar on the other. Exiled Saudi opposition activists have called for protests on Friday to galvanize resistance to the royal family. The al-Saud family has always regarded Islamist groups as the biggest internal threat to its rule over a country in which appeals to religious sentiment cannot be lightly dismissed and an al Qaeda campaign a decade ago killed hundreds. Prominent Islamist clerics Salman al-Awdah, Awad al-Qarni and Ali al-Omary were detained over the weekend, according to Saudi sources. On Tuesday, activists dedicated to monitoring and documenting what they describe as  prisoners of conscience  reported that at least eight other prominent figures, including clerics, academics, television anchors and a poet, had been  confirmed  detained since Monday.  ALQST, a London-based Saudi rights group, also reported more arrests, including several of the same people, although it gave no specific figure.  Al-Awdah, al-Qarni, Farhan al-Malki and Mostafa Hassan (are confirmed),  said Yahya al-Assiri, the center s head, referring to four of those reported to have been arrested.  The rest are also correct, but I don t have any specific information,  he added. Saudi officials could not be reached for comment. State news agency SPA said earlier on Tuesday that authorities had uncovered  intelligence activities for the benefit of foreign parties  by a group of people it did not identify. A Saudi security source told Reuters the suspects were accused of  espionage activities and having contacts with external entities including the Muslim Brotherhood , which Riyadh has classified as a terrorist organization. The government toughened its stance on dissent following the Arab Spring in 2011 after it averted unrest by offering billions of dollars in handouts and state spending. But the Brotherhood, which represents an ideological threat to Riyadh s dynastic system of rule, has gained power elsewhere in the region. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport links with Qatar in June over its alleged support for Islamists including the Brotherhood   a charge that Doha denies. Awdah reportedly was detained after he posted a message on his Twitter account welcoming a possible end to the rift between Qatar and other Arab countries which began in Egypt. Activists also suggested that poet Ziad bin Neheet may have been detained for posting a video in which he chastised journalists who had exploited the row with Qatar to heap abuse on each other.  What is happening between Qatar and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a normal thing in a political dispute, but the role which the media carried out was very, very negative,  he said. Activists have published a list of eight other people they fear may be arrested next. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\u2019s choice for the top U.S. trade negotiator on Tuesday pledged an \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy to aggressively enforce U.S. laws and trade deals to stop unfair imports and push China to scrap excess factory capacity. Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade Representative nominee, told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump chose him because of his trade enforcement background. \u201cI expect that we\u2019re going to have a very rigorous enforcement policy,\u201d Lighthizer told the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cThis will be the point of emphasis.\u201d Lighthizer said he would bring as many trade enforcement actions as can be justified under World Trade Organization rules, bilateral trade agreements and U.S. trade remedy laws.  As a deputy USTR in the 1980s, Lighthizer, 69, negotiated Japanese import quotas. As a veteran trade lawyer in more recent years, he pursued dozens of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against imports of steel and other products. Lighthizer said he would seek to increase trade while making it \u201cfreer and fairer\u201d to the benefit of U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses. An outspoken critic of China, Lighthizer said Beijing\u2019s industrial policies have supported vast amounts of \u201cuneconomic\u201d production capacity that would not survive without state support. He said this was particularly true in the steel and aluminum sectors, leading to the dumping of products into U.S. markets. Lighthizer told senators that he would engage with China in multilateral forums to reduce that capacity, but said trade enforcement actions may be more effective by raising the costs of keeping such factories alive.  \u201cIt has to be more difficult for them to maintain non-economic capacity, and that means enforcing our trade laws, and it means encouraging other countries where they can ship their products to enforce their trade laws.\u201d Lighthizer said he believes China was a \u201csubstantial currency manipulator\u201d in the past, but that it was unclear if Beijing was continuing to do so.  The comment was in line with more neutral statements on the subject from Trump administration officials more recently after the president threatened during his campaign to declare China a currency manipulator. Lighthizer also pledged to fight for strong protections for intellectual property rights and for digital trade access. In renegotiating the North American Free Trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, he said it was important not to lose gains in agricultural exports to those countries while encouraging more production to return to the United States. Regarding Canada, he said finding a solution to a long-running trade dispute over softwood lumber would be his top priority. Trump\u2019s cabinet already is crowded with senior trade officials, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the director of the newly created White House National Trade Council, Peter Navarro. Lighthizer said that if confirmed, he would have the USTR\u2019s full statutory powers and would play a lead role to \u201csort out\u201d U.S. trade policy, working closely with other agencies. ",

        "text": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer said on Friday that the pension reform bill that is  indispensable  to reduce the nation s budget deficit must be voted on this year in the lower house of Congress before the 2018 election year. Speaking at a chemical industry event, Temer appealed to businessmen to lobby Congress for approval of the unpopular  pension overhaul that is seen by investors as crucial to restoring Brazil s fiscal health.     Rodrigo Maia, the speaker of the lower house, said this week he would not put the bill to the vote until the government had secured the 308 votes the measure will need for passage. To allow more time for negotiations with reluctant lawmakers, Temer agreed with congressional leaders on Thursday to delay the lower house vote on the bill until the week of Dec. 18, the last before the Christmas recess. Once it clears the lower chamber, Temer expects the legislation to be voted on in the Senate in February.  Reform of the pension system is indispensable. It will allow Brazil to move forward,  Temer said.  But this must be the work of all of us. We need to show that we support this bill.  Temer acknowledged that lawmakers facing re-election next October had legitimate concerns about supporting the bill. The reform proposal seeks to increase the age at which Brazilians can retire and collect social security. It would also make pension payouts in Brazil, among the most generous in the world, more modest. If a vote is further delayed until next year, its chances of approval will be limited as lawmakers become more sensitive to the demands of voters when the election campaign gets underway. ",

Ugur Toksoy was arrested in October at the request of prosecutors in the Turkish region of Hatay, on charges of working for an NGO in Kosovo linked to U.S.-based cleric Fetullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of masterminding a failed coup attempt in 2016. The Hatay prosecutors said Toksoy had participated in the attempted coup. Gulen has denied any involvement in the attempted coup. The Kosovo prosecutor told the judge in withdrawing his case that he had asked the Turkish embassy to provide more evidence but had not received any. He said he could start the case again if Turkey sends more evidence.  Justice in Kosovo has won with this verdict because there was no evidence for extradition,  Toksoy s lawyer Adem Vokshi said after the session was over.  If Turkey had proof about him, they would have sent it by now.  Toksoy is one of two Kosovo-based Turks named on a Turkish wanted list of 11 people issued by the public prosecutor in Hatay province bordering Syria and seen by Reuters. The others are listed as living in Austria, Thailand, Mauritania, Romania and Lithuania. Gulen-linked schools and foundations have been facing funding problems and closing in the Balkans and elsewhere. Kosovo has refused to close Gulen schools on its soil, while Turkish government-supported schools are also being opened across the country. Turkey remains one of the biggest supporters of Kosovo s independence and its companies run the country s sole airport, own electricity distribution and have won the tenders to build two highways worth around $2 billion.

The prime minister said Britain would continue to provide assistance to states that were victims of aggression.  The UK will remain unconditionally committed to maintaining Europe s security,  May said in a speech at the Guildhall in London s financial district.  The comprehensive new economic partnership we seek will underpin our shared commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of those who seek to undermine them.   The British government is playing one its strongest cards in the Brexit negotiations by offering to put its defense and security assets at the disposal of the EU in the hope of winning concessions on future trading and economic relations. The country has bigger defense budgets than any other EU member state and its diplomatic and intelligence services are among the most extensive in Europe. Its government also argues it is one of the leading EU contributors to a range of security measures, such as data and evidence sharing, extradition measures and to the EU s police agency Europol. May on Monday accused Russia of fomenting violence in eastern Ukraine, of repeatedly violating the national airspace of several European countries, and mounting a campaign of cyber attacks. She also accused Russia of meddling in elections and hacking the Danish defense ministry, the German parliament and its state-media of planting fake stories and photo-shopped images in an attempt to undermine western institutions. May said the government is working to reform NATO so it is better placed to counter Russian hostility and has stepped up military and economic support to Ukraine.  We will take the necessary actions to counter Russian activity,  she said. May also said she wanted better relations with Russia if it worked to promote peace.   Russia can, and I hope one day will, choose this different path,  she said.  But for as long as Russia does not, we will act together to protect our interests and the international order on which they depend.  ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions unveiled on Wednesday a plan to go after doctors and pharmacies suspected of healthcare fraud by over-prescribing and unbridled distribution of addictive pain medications known as opioids. In a speech at a Columbus, Ohio, police academy, Sessions said a new Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit pilot program would also study death rates of patients with opioid prescriptions. \u201cWith these new resources, we will be better positioned to identify, prosecute and convict some of the individuals contributing to these tens of thousands of deaths a year,\u201d Sessions said in prepared remarks. He said the new program would pay for 12 assistant U.S. attorneys serving three-year terms to investigate and prosecute fraud in the prescribing of opioids. Deaths from opioids have surged in the United States.  In 2015, prescription painkillers and heroin killed more than 33,000 people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly half of those overdoses involved prescription pain medications. Sessions has made a priority of fighting drug-related crimes since taking over the U.S. Justice Department in February. It shut down AlphaBay, a dark web marketplace accused of facilitating a global trade in drugs as well as firearms and computer hacking tools. ",

        "text": "ABUJA (Reuters) - The United States has formally agreed to sell 12 Super Tucano A-29 planes and weapons to Nigeria, the West African country s air force said, confirming the resurrection of a deal frozen by the Obama administration over rights concerns. Former U.S. President Barack Obama delayed the sale in one of his last decisions in office after the Nigerian Air Force bombed a refugee camp in January. But his successor Donald Trump decided to press on with the transaction to support Nigeria s efforts to fight Boko Haram militants and to boost U.S. defense jobs, sources told Reuters in April. The U.S. ambassador to Nigeria presented letters of offer and acceptance to Nigeria s air force earlier on Wednesday, the air force said in a statement.  It said the U.S. State Department had approved the sale and final agreements would be signed and necessary payments made before Feb. 20. There was no immediate statement from the U.S. embassy or from authorities in Washington. U.S. government and Nigerian Air Force officials would meet in early January to discuss the early delivery of the aircraft once payment had been made, the Nigerian air force said. The sale of the 12 aircraft, with weapons and services, is worth $593 million, and includes thousands of bombs and rockets.  The propeller-driven plane with reconnaissance, surveillance and attack capabilities, is made by Brazil s Embraer. A second production line is in Florida, in a partnership between Embraer and privately held Sierra Nevada Corp of Sparks, Nevada. The Super Tucano costs more than $10 million each and the price can go much higher depending on the configuration. It is powered by a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT 6 engine. ",

        "title": "Democrats aim to turn anti-Trump sentiment into votes in Virginia",
        "text": "WOODBRIDGE, Va. (Reuters) - Legislative candidate Jennifer Carroll Foy\u2019s first bid for office puts her on the front lines of a Virginia statewide election being watched for early hints on how voters feel about President Donald Trump. Citing Trump\u2019s victory as a tipping point that pushed her to run, the 35-year-old public defender is one of 49 Democrats vying for Republican-held seats in the state\u2019s House of Delegates, up from 29 two years ago. The races will test whether Democrats can convert Virginians\u2019 unfavorable opinion of the Republican president in polls into votes and start clawing back some of the almost 1,000 legislative seats lost nationwide under Democratic President Barack Obama. Foy, long frustrated by her state legislature\u2019s attitude toward women\u2019s rights, is seeking a suburban Washington seat in one of the 17 Republican-controlled districts that voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton last year. \u201cTrump was just confirmation that we\u2019re regressing and not progressing,\u201d Foy told Reuters. \u201cEnough is enough. If it\u2019s not me (to run), then who? If it\u2019s not now, then when?\u201d Republicans hold a 66-34 advantage in the lower house of the Virginia legislature. Stephen Farnsworth, a political analyst at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, expects Democrats will make significant gains, especially by focusing on suburban districts. But a takeover of the chamber would require a collapse of Trump supporters, he told Reuters. \u201cA Democratic majority in the House of Delegates is going to require a tidal wave,\u201d Farnsworth said. The national mood has made Virginia Democrats hopeful. Opposition to Trump has galvanized hundreds of thousands of Americans and fueled huge turnouts at street protests since the  New York real estate developer\u2019s January inauguration.  A poll by the Washington Post and George Mason University\u2019s Schar School out May 22 showed 59 percent of Virginia voters disapproved of Trump\u2019s performance, compared with 36 percent who approved. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two things going for us in this upcoming election, and that\u2019s going to keep energy high,\u201d said David Toscano,\u00a0Democratic leader in the Virginia House. \u201cVoting for somebody, and also voting against somebody.\u201d Mark Walter, president of the national Republican State Leadership Committee, said his party was watching Virginia but that it was difficult to tell how voter feelings about Trump would affect the races.  In New Jersey, the only other state holding statewide elections this fall, Democrats already control both chambers. The Virginia Republican Party is unfazed by the surge of challengers. Republicans had $6.5 million for House races by the end of March, compared with the Democrats\u2019 $2.8 million, according to the most recent numbers from the state elections department. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re doing what we\u2019ve always done,\u201d Chairman John Whitbeck said in an interview with Reuters. \u201cRaise a lot of money, knock on a lot of doors and win a lot of seats.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Toscano, the House Democratic leader, said his party\u2019s candidates would use congressional Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature domestic legacy, as a campaign issue, as well as Trump\u2019s brief hiring freeze for most federal workers. The party also will cite Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe\u2019s legacy of adding thousands of new jobs and billions in capital investment as a selling point, Toscano said.  McAuliffe cannot run again due to term limits, but the edge fellow Democrats have in the race to replace him is expected to give the party\u2019s House hopefuls a boost. Democrats consider the 2nd District, home to sprawling housing subdivisions, strip malls and the Quantico Marine base, one of the party\u2019s best bets to pick up a seat. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Clinton won the district by 21 points in November, helping her win a state that was once reliably Republican in presidential elections. Foy and fellow Democrat Josh King will compete in the June 13 primary. The winner will face Republican Laquan Austion in November for the seat being vacated by the Republican incumbent, who is not seeking re-election. All three candidates say voters are more concerned about local issues, such as traffic jams, education and pollution from power plant coal ash, than Trump. \u201cObviously, the Trump effect is in the air, but we\u2019re focusing the energy into what we can do locally,\u201d said King, 36, a deputy sheriff who narrowly lost the 2015 election for the seat.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager,  lashed out on Tuesday at reports he was wiretapped by federal authorities, and his spokesman sent out a statement demanding a leaks probe and suggesting the surveillance was politically motivated. The statement issued by spokesman Jason Maloni on behalf of Manafort came a day after CNN reported that a secret court had authorized surveillance of Manafort under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), under which Americans can be targeted if they are suspected of acting as an agent of a foreign country. Manafort became Trump\u2019s campaign manager in June 2016 but was forced to resign two months later amid reports of his business relationship with the Kremlin-backed former Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovich. Manafort is being investigated as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The court initially authorized FISA surveillance of Manafort in 2014 but that lapsed in 2016 for lack of evidence, CNN reported. FISA surveillance resumed later in 2016 and continued into 2017 as part of the FBI\u2019s probe into ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian operatives, CNN said. \u201cIf true, it is a felony to reveal the existence of a FISA warrant, regardless of the fact that no charges ever emerged,\u201d Maloni said in the statement on behalf of Manafort. \u201cThe U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Inspector General should immediately conduct an investigation into these leaks and to examine the motivations behind a previous administration\u2019s effort to surveil a political opponent,\u201d he said. The special counsel\u2019s office and the FBI both declined to comment on Maloni\u2019s statement. They also did not comment on CNN\u2019s original report about surveillance of Manafort. Maloni urged the Justice Department to release any intercepts between Manafort and any non-Americans so people \u201ccan come to the same conclusion as the DOJ (Justice Department) - there is nothing there.\u201d As part of the special counsel\u2019s probe, federal agents with search warrants raided Manafort\u2019s Virginia home in July. The New York Times, citing two people close to the case, reported on Monday that prosecutors later told Manafort they planned to indict him. CNN said interest in Manafort deepened because of intercepted communications between him and Russian operatives, and among the Russians. The government eavesdropping continued into 2017, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to Trump after he became president. CNN said it was unclear if Trump was picked up on the surveillance. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - A proposal to raise California\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour by the year 2021 has qualified to be listed on the upcoming November ballot in the state, officials said on Tuesday. The development comes as a wave of minimum wage increases at the state level sweeps the United States as the federal minimum wage has gone more than six years without an increase from $7.25 an hour. The California Secretary of State\u2019s office said supporters of the measure, pushed by Labor group coalition Lift Up California, had gathered more than the 400,000 signatures needed to have the Fair Wage Act of 2016 placed on the ballot. \u201cCalifornia has led the country on environmental, health and civil rights protections and it\u2019s only appropriate that we would become the first state to enact a minimum wage that allows millions of families to live in dignity,\u201d Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl said in a statement.  She added that the measure would build on the efforts of Los Angeles lawmakers, who last year passed a law hiking the city\u2019s minimum wage to $15 by 2020. The measure would boost the state\u2019s minimum wage to $11 an hour in 2017, and increase it by a dollar an hour every year until reaching $15 an hour in 2021. After 2021, the minimum wage would be adjusted annually based on the rate of inflation. The California Chamber of Commerce said earlier this month that it would oppose any state-wide ballot initiatives for a $15 minimum wage, arguing that it would create new costs for state and local governments as well as businesses. A Field Poll published last August showed that about seven out of 10 respondents favored the measure, with nearly half saying they strongly favored it. Fourteen states and several cities began the new year with increases to their minimum wage. California and Massachusetts saw some of the biggest hikes among the states, both increasing from $9 to $10 an hour, according to an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures. ",

        "title": "Biden warns Ukraine on reforms, says EU sanctions on Russia at risk",
        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday warned Ukraine needs to live up to its promises economic and political reforms or risk seeing the European Union walk away from its sanctions on Russia. \u201cWe know that if they give an excuse to the EU, there are at least five countries right now that want to say \u2018We want out\u2019\u201d of sanctions against Moscow, Biden said, speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Europe imposed sanctions after Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea peninsula in 2014. Fighting has continued in the east of the country, despite the so-called Minsk ceasefire agreement, and Western powers fear peace efforts could unravel. In exchange for financial support from the United States and other Western allies, Ukraine promised reforms, but progress has been mixed. Biden\u2019s comments came a day after he met with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko at the United Nations, pushing on reforms in Ukraine\u2019s energy and justice sectors, while saying conditions had been met for a third U.S. sovereign loan guarantee of up to $1 billion. Biden said he has spent two to three hours a week on the phone with Ukrainian leaders since the crisis began, urging them to persist with reforms, while also pressuring Germany, France and Italy to hold fast on sanctions. \u201cThere\u2019s an overwhelming instinct in Europe to say, \u2018Hey: before [Poroshenko] became president, this was owned by Russia anyway. They had a puppet there. What difference does it make? What the hell\u2019s the difference? Why are you making us engage in these sanctions?\u2019\u201d Biden said. Noting a crisis of \u201cself-doubt\u201d in Europe caused by the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum decision to leave the bloc and the Syrian migration crisis, Biden said he has warned Poroshenko to make sure that the failure of the Minsk deal is not blamed on Ukraine. \u201cI\u2019ve been the guy on the back of Ukrainians - which was a thoroughly corrupt system when they came in - making the case that, \u2018You have to understand: everybody\u2019s willing to blame the victim, and you better straighten up and fly right,\u2019\u201d Biden said.

        "title": "Putin calls U.S. strikes on Syria illegal, blow to U.S.-Russia ties",
        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned U.S. cruise missile strikes on Syria as illegal on Friday, warning the move would further damage already battered U.S.-Russia relations which Moscow had hoped President Donald Trump would revive. U.S. officials said they had informed Russian forces ahead of the strikes \u2014 intended to punish the Syrian government for what they say was a chemical weapons attack earlier this week \u2014 and had avoided hitting Russian personnel. Satellite imagery suggests the Shayrat air base that was struck in western Syria is home to Russian special forces and military helicopters, part of the Kremlin\u2019s effort to help the Syrian government fight Islamic State and other militant groups. Russia\u2019s main air base and a naval facility were not hit.  Moscow had been hoping to cooperate with Trump to jointly fight Islamic State in Syria, a move it was banking on to boost U.S.-Russia ties which are at a post-Cold War low. After the U.S. strikes, that task now looks harder. \u201cPresident Putin views the U.S. strikes on Syria as aggression against a sovereign state in violation of the norms of international law and on a made-up up pretext,\u201d said a Kremlin statement.  \u201cThis step by Washington will inflict major damage on U.S.-Russia ties.\u201d  Putin, a staunch ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was holding a meeting of Russia\u2019s Security Council to discuss the strike on Friday afternoon and the Russian Foreign Ministry called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council. A foreign ministry statement said Moscow was suspending a Syrian air safety agreement with the United States originally drawn up to ensure that the two countries\u2019 planes did not collide. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to any specialist that the decision to launch a strike was taken in Washington before the events in Idlib (the province where the gas poisoning took place) which were simply used as a pretext for a show of force,\u201d the ministry said. Dmitry Peskov, Putin\u2019s spokesman, told reporters the U.S. strikes had been conducted to help rebel groups fighting Assad. Russia would keep military channels of communication open with Washington, but would not exchange any information through them, he added. When asked whether Russia had deactivated its own anti-missile defense systems in Syria before the missile strike, Peskov declined to comment.  U.S.-RUSSIA TIES IN PERIL The Russian Defence Ministry meanwhile mocked the effectiveness of the U.S. strikes, saying only 23 missiles had found their targets. It was unclear where another 36 had landed, it said, promising Syrian air defenses would now be beefed up.  A Russian frigate armed with Kalibr cruise missiles sailed through the Bosphorus en route to the eastern Mediterranean in the early hours of Friday morning, according to pictures taken by Turkish bloggers for their online Bosphorus Naval News project. It was unclear if that was related to the U.S. strikes.  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there were no reports of any Russians being hurt in the attack. He said he hoped U.S.-Russia ties would not be irreparably hurt as a result.  Rex Tillerson is due to make his first visit to Moscow next week as U.S. secretary of state, an eagerly awaited event in Russia where politicians have been anxious to try to use the change of administration to reboot relations.   One senior Russian lawmaker, Leonid Slutsky, told the Russia 24 television channel on Friday Moscow should use the Tillerson visit to \u201ctry and talk sense into Washington\u201d. Syria, ironically, was one of the few areas where analysts believed Moscow and Washington might be able to find common ground.     The Kremlin says Washington\u2019s allegations that the Syrian army possesses and used chemical weapons are flat out wrong and accuses the West of ignoring rebel use of such weapons. It says scores of Syrians were killed by poison gas on Tuesday because the Syrian air force had struck a militant bomb-making factory which it said contained chemical weapons procured in Iraq. Western countries have dismissed this version of events and say Syrian planes dropped the gas, which Assad denies.  The Kremlin said on Friday the U.S. attack had thrown up a \u201cserious obstacle\u201d to the idea championed by Trump during his election campaign of creating an international coalition against terrorism.  Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the upper house\u2019s international affairs committee, said it looked like Trump may have been pushed into approving military action by the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies.  \u201cOne way or another, Russian cruise missiles are continuing to strike terrorists and American ones government troops who are heading the war against the terrorists,\u201d Kosachev wrote on social media. \u201cI fear that with these approaches the hoped-for U.S.-Russian anti-terrorism coalition in Syria ... is breathing its last before it is even born.\u201d ",

        "title": "Inspection battle threatens Egypt's wheat supply",
        "text": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Wheat shipments to Egypt, the world s largest buyer, are being disrupted by a dispute involving government inspectors angered by a ban on the expenses-paid foreign trips they once enjoyed to approve cargoes at their ports of origin. Those trips, funded by exporters, have been canceled as part of Egypt s efforts to streamline imports worth more than $1 billion a year. Traders say the new system has backfired as inspectors are now rejecting cargoes at Egyptian ports on arbitrary and unpredictable grounds. There is more to the problem than erratic policies and red tape, according to interviews with grains traders, agriculture quarantine inspectors, government officials, and a review of inspection documents.  According to these sources, difficulties for importers are rather the result of a tug-of-war over the right to inspect cargoes abroad, where until recently government quarantine inspectors enjoyed fully-funded trips, dinners and shopping at the expense of supply companies looking to secure safe passage for their wheat. By applying higher standards to grains upon arrival, inspectors are driving up costs in a bid to undermine inspection companies that replaced them abroad, traders said. Six inspectors who Reuters spoke to denied they are trying to get their foreign trips reinstated and said they are simply upholding quality standards.  Suppliers say uncertainty is prompting them to add premiums of up to $500,000 per cargo to hedge against risks. With Egypt expecting to buy around 7 million tonnes of wheat in the fiscal year that began in July, these premiums add millions of dollars to the government s food subsidy bill. The bread supply chain has ground to a halt on several occasions as traders have boycotted tenders. Subsidized bread is a staple for millions of poor Egyptians and the country s leaders are always keen to keep supplies flowing for fear of unrest. Wheat traders say the only way out of the problem is for the government bodies involved to sit down and thrash out standards all sides can agree on.  Getting cargoes passed under the old system often came down to keeping government inspectors comfortable, traders said. When a $6 million wheat cargo at a port in Ukraine suddenly stopped loading two years ago, its agent found Egyptian inspectors had halted the process because their hotel would not give them a late breakfast, traders said. The delay cost the supply company $8,000 in port fees.  As soon as we arranged for the hotel to give them a later breakfast, everything went smoothly and the shipment was passed. It wasn t a wheat problem. It was a breakfast problem,  said a Cairo-based trader responsible for the cargo who asked to remain anonymous. Six other traders described the system in similar terms, saying shopping for electronics and clothes, expensive dinners, and hotel room upgrades were the cost of keeping their grains moving out of ports from Odessa to Dunkirk. One trader said the money paid to inspectors could equal their annual salary.  You re talking about four to five people, and you have to take care of them from A to Z, meaning you are taking them shopping and you are paying,  said Med Star for Trading President Hesham Soliman.     Soliman said the delegations grew more expensive.  They began needing more pocket money, the hotels have to be certain hotels, the tickets, the visa,  he said. Traders said they would spend about $30,000 on the inspectors, which also typically included a $3,500 pocket money payment per person, according to invoices seen by Reuters. Agricultural quarantine inspectors who Reuters spoke to on condition of anonymity have quoted the same figures for the trips but say the old system was still cheaper for Egypt.   I can t deny that I benefited, but the country benefited more. Look how much they re spending now,  one inspector said, referring to the high risk premiums traders now put on cargoes offered to Egypt. Traders say the system was a relatively cheap way to win approval for their wheat abroad, which protected a cargo from  being rejected at Egyptian ports, something that could mean big losses, or even bankruptcy for smaller firms.  If they re making it sound like we were spending too much, you have the figures, compare the numbers. They re spending a lot more now on the inspections,  the inspector said.  The old arrangement unraveled in late 2015, when a French wheat cargo was rejected in Egypt for containing traces of the common grain fungus ergot despite being approved by government inspectors abroad. As other shipments were rejected and import rules appeared to be tightening, some traders said they no longer found the traveling inspectors a bet worth taking.  We got to a point where we couldn t deal with this. You have a fixed cost and you still have no guarantee that the shipment will enter the country,  said Soliman. A group of traders, including Soliman, persuaded the government to ban traveling delegations, which Egypt did in a prime ministerial decree in late 2016 that handed inspections abroad to private companies and made the agriculture quarantine inspectors subject to the oversight of a trade ministry authority. In an interview at the offices of the General Organization for Export and Import Control (GOEIC), Ismail Gaber, who heads the agency that now has the final word on wheat inspections, told Reuters the travel regime had raised suspicions of corruption that he would rather keep civil servants away from.   There is of course the issue of corruption, I want to take my employee away from this suspicion. I don t want the supplier and the employee to have the same self-interest,  he said.   If he takes someone with him abroad, the supplier says  I ve already taken him with me ... you gave me a government employee and you inspected there so you can t find a problem with it here (in Egypt) after all of this ,  Gaber said. But having lost their travel benefits, the inspectors are making their presence felt. Since January, when the new inspection regime came online, inspectors in Egypt have subjected nearly all shipments to costly processes before being approved at Egyptian ports, which add tens of thousands of dollars in costs. In June, a group of inspectors won a court case that argued that the new system illegally granted their mandate to GOEIC, which the inspectors said was ill-equipped to protect the country from harmful grain contaminants. The government has appealed and ignored a court order to restore the old inspection regime, including traveling delegations. The inspectors, who are still checking cargoes under the new inspection regime, say they are just trying to stop bad wheat getting into Egypt and deny they are trying to get their overseas trips back.  One inspector said checks were now tougher at Egyptian ports because importers were sending poor-quality grains.  Traders however said two big state grain purchases halted for containing poppy seeds demonstrated that inspectors were seeking new ways to show that inspection companies abroad are not up to the task. As a result, traders hiked prices or stayed away from a recent state tender. The only way out of the impasse, traders say, is for  government agencies to agree on consistent rules.  Without that, we are just waiting for the next victim,  said one.  (For graphic click: here) ",

        "title": "Bathroom lawsuit could send transgender rights to Supreme Court",
        "text": "(Reuters) - A lawsuit brought by Texas and other states against the Obama administration\u2019s policy on bathroom access may move the United States closer to a resolution on transgender rights by putting the issue on a trajectory for the Supreme Court. Conservative officials from 11 states sued the federal government on Wednesday to overturn a directive that transgender students be allowed to use the bathroom matching their gender identity instead of being forced to use one corresponding to gender assigned at birth. The governor of a 12th state, Mississippi, said he planned to join the lawsuit. The country\u2019s high court has never ruled on a main question of the lawsuit: Do federal legal protections against sex discrimination apply to transgender people? The plaintiffs picked a path that could get them two quick wins in lower courts. The lawsuit is expected to be heard first by an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush and if there is an appeal by a conservative federal appeals court covering Texas. If that appeals court ruled against the Obama administration, the Supreme Court may feel compelled to take up the matter because of a likely conflict with a ruling last month from a federal appeals court in Virginia. That ruling revived a transgender teen\u2019s lawsuit against his school district.  The Supreme Court is more likely to agree to hear a case when there is a split among different federal appeals courts, and such a conflict does not yet exist on transgender rights.  The plaintiffs have accused the administration of President Barack Obama of overreaching its authority and said the U.S. Congress, or individual states, should set policy.  At least two provisions of federal law ban discrimination on the basis of sex: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which covers employment, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  When lawmakers passed the education amendments, they did not consider that the law could one day be applied to gender identity, said Jeremy Tedesco, senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group. \u201cThe (administration\u2019s) lawless interpretation ignores the will of Congress in enacting Title IX,\u201d Tedesco said. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear case of federal overreach.\u201d The Obama administration has argued that the education amendments encompass discrimination based on gender identity, including transgender status. It said in a letter to school districts this month that their access to federal money depended on their compliance. The states that sued have two paths to victory, Tedesco said: a ruling that the Obama administration did not follow proper procedure for making new regulations, which would leave the larger issue unsettled, or that its interpretation of Title IX is inconsistent with the law. Without clear guidance from the courts, the question of transgender rights would remain open to interpretation by federal agencies, meaning a future president could take the opposite view of Obama. The Republican-controlled Congress has the power to end the dispute immediately, either in favor of transgender rights or against them, but it has shown few signs of acting, especially with a Democrat, Obama, in the White House. A series of decisions suggests courts are coming around to a more expansive definition of sex discrimination, said Jennifer Levi, director of the Transgender Rights Project at GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders. Federal agencies clearly have the authority to interpret civil rights law when its application is unclear, she said. \u201cTo characterize (the administration\u2019s position) as extraordinary or overreaching shows a complete misunderstanding of what these agencies do,\u201d Levi said. The states countered in their lawsuit that the federal agencies went beyond mere interpretation of civil rights law and in effect created new regulations that should have gone through a notice-and-comment procedure. A court could also find that the states\u2019 lawsuit was premature because the Obama administration has not yet moved to cut off funding to any state or school district, said Arthur Leonard, a professor at New York Law School and an expert on LGBT law.

        "title": "Clinton campaign studying alternative to U.S. ethanol mandate",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign has solicited advice from California regulators on how to revamp a federal regulation requiring biofuels like corn-based ethanol be blended into the nation\u2019s gasoline supply, according to campaign and state officials. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The move is the clearest sign yet that, if elected, Clinton would seek to adjust the regulation, called the Renewable Fuel Standard, possibly hurting her chances in corn-growing states like Iowa where she faces a tough battle against Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. The Renewable Fuel Standard, created by Congress in 2005, mandates that transportation fuel sold in the United States contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. It was intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions and expand the U.S. renewable fuels sector while lowering reliance on imported oil. It is opposed by the oil industry and environmentalists and has been criticized as a mere subsidy to corn producers.  Clinton advisers have contacted the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to discuss whether a policy like California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a market-based system rather than a mandate, could be applied at a national level to replace or augment the Renewable Fuel Standard, and other issues, CARB officials said. Mary Nichols, head of the CARB, said she discussed the state\u2019s regulations with Clinton advisers. While a backer of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Nichols said she told Clinton\u2019s advisers they could avoid political backlash by focusing on other carbon-reduction strategies instead, such as expanding electric vehicle sales and cleaning up emissions from coal-fired electricity. Nichols did not provide further details on the discussions. A Clinton campaign official, who asked not to be named, confirmed the discussions with CARB but gave no further details.  A campaign spokesman, Tyrone Gayle, said the campaign has been seeking advice from \u201ca diverse set of stakeholders.\u201d He added that the Clinton campaign \u201cdoes not support replacing the RFS with a national low-carbon fuel standard\u201d but did not elaborate. Former Obama administration climate and energy adviser Heather Zichal said on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last week that the Renewable Fuel Standard was broken, but that a Clinton administration could make \u201cmodifications\u201d to fix it. \u201cMandates aren\u2019t necessarily a perfect way to regulate,\u201d Zichal said at the event. The U.S. corn lobby hopes to convince both Clinton and Trump to uphold the regulation, which requires a doubling of U.S. biofuels use to 36 billion gallons per year by 2022, when congressionally mandated volume targets are set to expire. The program is designed to last indefinitely after that. Environmentalists, anti-hunger activists and the oil sector have called for the rule to be repealed or changed because they say it raises food and fuel costs without delivering the emissions reductions that it was intended to achieve. MARKET-BASED SYSTEM The California regulation, a key part of the state\u2019s effort to combat climate change, requires a 10 percent reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 2020, but leaves it up to companies\u00a0to decide how to reach that target. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 California enacted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in 2007 targeting oil refiners and distributors that sell in the state\u2019s market. It angered Midwestern ethanol interests because the regulation counts the carbon dioxide footprint of transporting biofuels into the state for blending, effectively blocking many of those imports. Oil companies have complained that the regulation is costly. Clinton in May expressed support for the federal Renewable Fuel Standard in an opinion piece published in an Iowa newspaper, but said it could be improved. Clinton\u2019s openness to overhauling the Renewable Fuel Standard appears to contrast with Trump\u2019s position. During the state-by-state battle for the Republican presidential nomination, Trump said he supported the biofuel mandates set out in the Renewable Fuel Standard. Corn and ethanol industry lobbyists said they have been talking with both the Clinton and Trump campaigns to argue in favor of the Renewable Fuel Standard. ",

        "title": "U.S.-backed alliance says Russian jets struck its fighters in east Syria",
        "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed Syrian militias said Russian warplanes struck their positions in Deir al-Zor province on Monday, which Moscow denied, generating friction between two rival campaigns against Islamic State. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias fighting with a U.S.-led coalition said the attack killed one of its fighters and injured two.  Major-General Igor Konashenkov of Russia s defense ministry was cited by RIA news agency as issuing a denial, saying Russia was always careful to ensure its air strikes were accurate.  A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition, Colonel Ryan Dillon, said rounds had hit in the area around the SDF but he could not confirm they were fired by Russia.  A war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Russian rounds had not hit the SDF near Deir al-Zor. The SDF later said it had responded to the source of fire that targeted it from near the city of Deir al-Zor on Monday morning without specifying which forces it had attacked.  Russia and the United States back separate offensives against Islamic State in eastern Syria, both of which are advancing in oil-rich Deir al-Zor province bordering Iraq. The assaults are converging on Islamic State from opposite sides of the Euphrates that bisects the province, the jihadists  last major foothold in Syria, with the river often acting as a dividing line.  But their proximity has at times raised the risk of clashes that could stoke tensions between the competing world powers.  With Russian air support and Iran-backed militias, Syrian troops are advancing along the west bank of the river. A Kurdish commander of the SDF, which has approached along the east bank with U.S. jets and special forces, told Reuters on Monday the alliance expected to completely push Islamic State out of its former Syrian headquarters of Raqqa within a month. With the Kurdish YPG militia at its forefront, the SDF said last week that, after seizing 80 percent of Raqqa, the battle for the city had entered its final stages.  In the coming days, the battles will be at their most intense...,  said Jihan Sheikh Ahmed, spokeswoman for the offensive.  We expect, under our plan, that we will be able to liberate Raqqa in less than a month.   RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE  The SDF also captured a large gas field on the Euphrates  bank on Saturday.  Russian and regime forces have mounted a treacherous attack against our forces (there) ...with artillery and aircraft,  the SDF said in a statement.  We will not stand by with our arms crossed and we will use our legitimate right to self-defense.  On Monday, Russia s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said U.S. policy in Syria was to blame for the death from shelling of Russian general Valery Asapov near Deir al-Zor, which the defense ministry in Moscow announced on Sunday.  Ryabkov called into question U.S. commitment to the fight against Islamic State, accusing it of trying to slow the Syrian army s advance. Last week, the Pentagon accused Moscow of bombing SDF positions on the eastern side of the river. Russia denied this, warning the United States it would target the SDF if its own forces came under fire. Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition, said it was communicating with Russia to ensure measures to avoid unintended conflict between the offensives were being followed.  ",

        "title": "Billionaire green donor launches U.S. millennial voter drive",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer\u2019s super PAC launched a $25 million youth voter drive on Monday in seven political battleground states to help elect candidates that champion climate change policies in November\u2019s general election.  Steyer\u2019s NextGen Climate super PAC, a political group that raises funds to boost candidates with strong environmental platforms, said the campaign aims to boost turnout of millennials, who have become one of the largest potential voter groups. In the lead-up to the November general election, NextGen will deploy hundreds of organizers across over 200 colleges to register young voters and facilitate on-campus voting. \u201cWe are determined that they will be a difference maker,\u201d Steyer told reporters on a conference call. The group is targeting seven battleground states where Steyer said millennial voters could \u201cmake up the difference in a tight race.\u201d Those states are Pennsylvania, Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada, Illinois and Colorado. Steyer has been the second largest individual political donor in 2016, having spent $13 million so far this year, according to OpenSecrets.org. NextGen said the number of registered millennials has nearly tripled since 2008 from 17.2 million to 50.3 million, making the demographic a key political force in 2016.  Climate change and clean energy is an area where there is widespread millennial interest.  NextGen cited a June 2015 poll that found that 73 percent of young voters want the United States to get 50 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. The group has not yet announced which candidates it will endorse in the presidential or congressional races but said it has challenged all candidates to say how they would achieve a goal of hitting a 50 percent clean energy target by 2030. He said the air and water impacts of fracking, a controversial drilling technique that has been responsible for a boom in U.S. oil and natural gas production over the past decade, shows the U.S. needs to make a faster transition away from fossil fuels. Steyer said NextGen will spend around $25 million on the months-long campaign and will launch several other initiatives later in the election cycle.  Steyer\u2019s PAC in 2014 aimed to make climate change into a wedge issue in the 2014 midterm elections, spending over $70 million with mixed results.  But with millennial voters turning out in record numbers in the 2016 primaries, Steyer sees a formula for success. \u201cWe need to make sure to carry on that momentum until November,\u201d he said.

        "text": "VIC/CERDANYOLA DEL VALLES, Spain (Reuters) - Catalonia votes on Thursday for a new administration in an election many hope will resolve Spain s worst crisis in decades after the region declared independence leading Madrid to sack local leaders. Polls suggest neither the pro-independence nor the pro-unity camp will win a majority. The likely outcome is a hung parliament and many weeks of wrangling to form a new regional government. In the separatist heartland of rural Catalonia, fireman Josep Sales says he hopes the results will endorse the result of an Oct. 1 illegal referendum on independence from Spain and lead to the creation of a republic.  If we get a majority, something will have to be done. And if the politicians don t do it, the people will unite,  he said, speaking from the town fire station where many of the red fire engines bear the slogan  Hello Democracy .  If we have to bring the country to a standstill, so be it,  said the 45-year-old, who plans to vote for Carles Puigdemont, the sacked Catalan head who is campaigning for election from self-imposed exile in Belgium.  The uncertainty generated by the independence drive has hurt hotel occupancy rates in the region, dented consumer sales and caused more than 3,000 businesses to move their registered headquarters from Catalonia. It has also bitterly divided Catalan society between those who support independence and those who favor unity with Spain.  Everyone is eager for the election and to see how it turns out, because nothing is clear at the moment,  said 34-year-old flamenco teacher Maria Gonzalez, who lives in Cerdanyola del Valles, an industrial suburb of Barcelona.  The feeling on the streets is not comfortable,  says Gonzalez, the daughter of migrants from other parts of Spain who moved to Catalonia decades ago and who plans to vote for pro-unity party Ciudadanos ( Citizens ).

Broadcasters WDR and NDR and daily newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung said the trial began in the southern Turkish city of Karaman on Thursday and cited the indictment as saying the woman faced several years in prison. They said the woman, whom they did not name, was born in Turkey but had lived in southwest Germany for more than 20 years and had been a German citizen for 15. She had been arrested in Turkey in August 2016 and released in September after pressure from Germany s foreign ministry but was not allowed to leave the country, they said. Earlier on Thursday, the ministry confirmed that another German citizen detained in southern Turkey last week had been released but banned from travel. Turkey s Dogan news agency said the man and his German partner had been detained while on holiday in Antalya. The partner had already been freed after questioning. Dogan said the couple had also been held as part of investigations into Gulen and Kurdish militants in Syria. Gulen has denied any link to the failed coup. Thursday s release means 10 German citizens remain in Turkish detention on political charges. The arrests have raised tensions between Ankara and Berlin and led Chancellor Angela Merkel to call for a review of relations and of Turkey s EU accession talks. The detainees include dual German-Turkish citizen Deniz Yucel, who has been held for more than 200 days. ",

        "text": "HARARE (Reuters) - Robert Mugabe s 37-year rule may be over, but a culture of political fawning by the Zimbabwean state media and fear of those in authority still flourishes.  The Herald newspaper and the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation - state and ruling ZANU-PF party mouthpieces - routinely heaped lavish praise on the 93-year-old Mugabe and his wife Grace in sycophantic articles and commentaries. With the sudden change of guard, Zimbabwe s official media is having a hard time shaking off old habits and is now tailoring its eulogies to fit Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe s successor. State radio intersperses programs with martial music from the war of independence in honor of Mnangagwa s war veteran allies and the army.   One morning talk show host spoke glowingly on Tuesday of seeing the presidential motorcade at 0645 GMT. This, he said, signaled the new leader was keeping his word to hit the ground running.  The president is showing the way so get to work on time,  he said. Mnangagwa, 75, a close Mugabe ally for several decades, took power after the military takeover on Nov. 15 following a succession battle that split the ruling ZANU-PF party.  Comrade Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, (is) a true son of the soil who sacrificed his entire life to serving Zibmabwe as evidenced by the role he played in the liberation struggle as well as after independence up to this day. We are blessed to have you as our leader,  an advertisement by the ministry for women affairs, gender and community development gushed in the  Herald. Not all within the ruling party are comfortable with the trend though. Justice Wadyajena, a Mnangagwa admirer and outspoken ZANU-PF parliamentarian, reminded his Twitter followers of the dangers of personality cults.  Those falling all over each other pledging loyalty to President ED are just brutes playing meek,  Wadyajena wrote, referring to Mnangagwa by the initials of his first and middle names.   If you really are principled, there s no reason to bootlick, your conduct should speak for itself. We ve seen the danger of personalizing governance and gatekeeping a NATIONAL FIGURE!!  Mnangagwa, who served Mugabe loyally for 52 years, is expected to form a new cabinet this week. Zimbabweans are watching to see if he breaks with the past and names a broad-based government or selects figures from the Mugabe era s old guard. ",

        "title": "Factbox: U.N. sanctions on North Korea currently in force",
        "text": "(Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council has issued a wide range of sanctions against North Korea, including entities and individuals in the reclusive country, for pursuing nuclear and ballistic missile programs in defiance of U.N. resolutions. The United States, Japan and South Korea have also issued sanctions on North Korea, but they are not binding on other countries. The United Nations has blacklisted 39 North Korean individuals and 42 entities, which are subject to a travel ban and asset freeze. U.N. member states are obliged to enforce the sanctions, which are far-reaching and comprehensive. However, many include gray areas and exceptions which are subject to interpretation. The following U.N. sanctions are currently in force: North Korea is under a total U.N. arms embargo. The sale of all arms and related materiel is banned. Any financial transactions related to the procurement of North Korean arms are also included under the sanctions.  The embargo has been in place since 2006 and was expanded in 2009 to include small arms and light weapons. North Korea is also prohibited from selling helicopters under U.N. sanctions. Under U.N. sanctions, North Korea is banned or partially banned from selling coal, iron, iron ore, gold, titanium ore, vanadium ore, copper, nickel, silver, zinc and rare earth minerals. Coal exports are allowed up to a maximum of $400.87 million or 7,500,000 metric tonnes a year, whichever is lower, provided U.N. member states do not purchase the coal from a sanctioned entity, and can prove that the coal is for \u201clivelihood purposes\u201d. China, North Korea\u2019s biggest trade partner, said in February it would suspend all imports of coal from North Korea for the rest of the year as part of its efforts to implement the sanctions.   Externally-sourced coal which transits through the North Korean city of Rason, where Russia maintains a warm-water port, is exempt from the ban. Sales of North Korean copper, nickel, silver and zinc are completely banned under U.N. sanctions. Only sales of aviation fuel, jet fuel and rocket fuel to North Korea are banned under U.N. sanctions. The ban does not apply to North Korean civilian aircraft, including state airline Air Koryo. There are no restrictions on crude oil or other oil products. Any financial services which contribute to North Korea\u2019s banned missile and nuclear programs, or help Pyongyang evade sanctions, are banned by the United Nations. Member states are prohibited from opening branches, subsidiaries or offices of North Korean banks. Joint ventures, ownership, or correspondent banking relationships with North Korean banks is banned.  Member states are required to expel and repatriate any individuals working for a North Korean bank or institution on their territory, and limit the number of bank accounts for North Korean diplomatic missions. U.N. member states are required to de-register any vessel which is owned, operated or crewed by North Korea, meaning North Korean-owned ships cannot fly the flag of another country, which has been one way of evading detection. Member states are also not allowed to provide insurance services to North Korean ships. North Korea is prohibited from selling its ships under U.N. sanctions. It also cannot provide North Korean crews to ships from other countries. The U.N. has not sanctioned North Korea\u2019s state-owned airline, Air Koryo. It has, however, banned the sale of aviation fuel, jet fuel and rocket fuel to North Korea, but Air Koryo and any North Korean civilian aircraft refueling overseas are exempt from this. U.N. member states are required to prohibit, inspect or deny landing of any North Korean aircraft within their territory they suspect to be carrying banned items, or taking part in any prohibited activities.  Separately, the United States has unilaterally sanctioned Air Koryo, banning its citizens from doing business with the airline. It is unclear, however, if the sanctions cover U.S. citizens using the airline to travel to North Korea for tourism. U.N. member states are required to inspect any cargo destined for, coming from or brokered by North Korea, whether by air, sea, road or rail. This includes the inspection of checked or carry-on baggage of people traveling to or from North Korea. It is illegal under U.N. sanctions to directly or indirectly supply luxury goods to North Korea. In the case of North Korea, the U.N. defines luxury goods as: Jewellery and precious stones, yachts, luxury cars, racing cars, luxury watches, snowmobiles, jet skis, recreational sports equipment, tableware worth more than $100 and rugs or tapestries worth more than $500. The resolutions require member states to reduce the number of staff at North Korean diplomatic missions. North Korean diplomats or consular officials are only allowed one bank account each. The use of real estate for any non-diplomatic or consular activities in member states\u2019 territories is banned. The training of or by North Koreans in military, police and paramilitary techniques is banned.  With the exception of medical exchanges, U.N. member states are not allowed to provide training or cooperation in the fields of nuclear science, aerospace, advanced manufacturing and advanced aeronautical, chemical, mechanical, electrical or industrial engineering. The sale of North Korean statues is banned under U.N. sanctions. ",

        "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran s military chief of staff visited a frontline position near the Syrian city of Aleppo, a military news outlet run by the Lebanese group Hezbollah reported on Friday, during a visit that has underlined Tehran s deep military role in Syria. General Mohammad Baqeri visited the position with a number of Iranian officers, according to the report, which was  accompanied by photos showing Baqeri looking at a map and peering through binoculars. Neighboring Israel has expressed deep concern over Iran s role in Syria, where Iranian fighters and Iran-backed groups such as Hezbollah have played a major role fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad. Baqeri met Assad on Thursday during a visit to set out a joint military strategy, Syrian state media reported.  Baqeri has warned Israel against breaching Syrian airspace and territory and pledged to increase cooperation with Syria s military to fight both Israel and Sunni jihadist militants. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Iran is strengthening its foothold in Syria, warning that Israel would  do whatever it takes  to protect its security. Helped by Russian air power, Iran-backed groups including Hezbollah played a major part in the Syrian government campaign to recapture eastern districts of Aleppo city from Syrian rebels last year.

        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), two of Silicon Valley\u2019s most powerful companies, on Thursday backed Apple Inc\u2019s (AAPL.O) refusal to help the FBI break into an iPhone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino attack, saying that complying would set a dangerous precedent for privacy. It took two days, but the companies\u2019 entry solidifies a small but powerful band of tech giants supporting Apple in its quest to buck government demands that it says would irreparably damage security and erode consumer trust.  Among the first to come to Apple\u2019s defense was its chief rival. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai of Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google tweeted in support of Apple on Wednesday. But other companies are staying mum. Yahoo Inc YHOO.O and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) have yet to weigh in on the case. In characteristic fashion, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey used the service itself to lend support to Apple CEO Tim Cook, tweeting \"We stand with @tim_cook and Apple (and thank him for his leadership).\" (bit.ly/1RbfI5j) In a statement, Facebook said, \u201cWe will continue to fight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security of their systems.\u201d The case has intensified the rift between tech companies and law enforcement over the limits of encryption. And law enforcement groups have been vocal about their support for the Justice Department. Although some firms have remained silent, the industry is firmly on Apple\u2019s side, said Aaron Levie, CEO of cloud-based storage provider Box Inc (BOX.N).  \u201cCompanies choose to use their political capital when it is really important or relevant to them,\u201d Levie said.\u00a0\u201cIf individually pressed you would see the same message from essentially any Internet or hardware or enterprise software CEO or company, and that\u2019s because the fundamental security model of our technology would break if you were to comply with this kind of order.\u201d Levie said he unequivocally supports Cook\u2019s stance. \u201cThe whole grounds on which Apple is standing on are just super important,\u201d he said.  At the center of the case is an iPhone used by Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people and wounded 22 in a shooting rampage in San Bernardino, California. The young married couple sympathized with Islamic State militants, and government investigators want the data on the phone to learn more about their activities the day of the shooting and their contacts with either accomplices or Islamic State. Apple\u2019s Cook had said the court\u2019s demand threatened the security of Apple\u2019s customers and had \u201cimplications far beyond the legal case at hand.\u201d ",

        "title": "U.S. pressed Saudis to ease Yemen blockade: sources",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked Saudi Arabia to ease its blockade of Yemen, two sources said, just days before the Saudi-led military coalition announced on Wednesday it would let aid flow through the Yemeni port of Hodeidah and allow U.N. flights to the capital.  It was not clear if pressure from Washington was the direct cause of the Saudi change of heart but the request from Tillerson to Saudi Arabia s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was one of several U.S. attempts this month to have Riyadh soften its hawkish foreign policy.  Tillerson asked for a loosening of the blockade on Yemen during a roughly 45-minute phone call at the beginning of this week, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. R.C. Hammond, a top adviser to Tillerson, confirmed the exchange with Prince Mohammed. The secretary of state  has brought the request to (the) Saudis  attention several times over the past months,  he added.      The Trump administration, according to U.S. officials and a European diplomat, also pressed the Saudis to allow Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri to return to Beirut after he flew to Riyadh on Nov.4 and abruptly announced his resignation. The efforts to take the edge off Saudi Arabia s foreign policy reflect growing U.S. concern about Riyadh s direction despite high-profile attempts by President Donald Trump to improve relations with the longtime U.S. ally.              Publicly, Trump, his top aides and senior Saudi officials have hailed what they say is a major improvement in U.S.-Saudi ties compared with relations under former President Barack Obama, who upset the Saudis by sealing a nuclear deal with their arch-foe Iran. Privately, however, U.S. diplomats and intelligence analysts   express growing dismay over Riyadh s foreign policy, especially toward Yemen and Lebanon, as Saudi Arabia aims to contain Iranian influence.      It is my understanding that the administration is frustrated. There has been of course varying degrees of frustration from different members of the administration,  U.S. Senator Todd Young said of the situation in Yemen.  Young, a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke before the Saudi-led military coalition s decision was announced on Wednesday.         The coalition, which is fighting Houthi rebels, said it would allow humanitarian aid access through Hodeidah and U. N. flights to the capital Sanaa, more than two weeks after blockading the country to stop the flow of arms from Iran. Yemen, in civil war and under bombardment by a Saudi-led coalition, faces a deep humanitarian crisis and aid workers warn of famine if the blockade were not lifted.                   A senior Saudi official told Reuters that even before Tillerson and Prince Mohammed spoke recently, senior White House officials had communicated to the Saudi ambassador in Washington the importance of taking those two steps.  They stressed the importance of addressing the humanitarian situation in Yemen and we said that we understood and that the closures were temporary while we work on a comprehensive aid and access plan,  the official said. An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that White House and National Security Council officials worked on easing the blockade with senior Saudi officials, including Prince Mohammed and his younger brother Khalid, the Saudi ambassador to the United States.    Much of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, multiple U.S. officials say, is conducted in a tight circle and led by Trump s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who has established a direct channel with Prince Mohammed. Kushner  did not oppose  the pressure on the Saudis and United Arab Emirates to ease humanitarian suffering in Yemen, said one U.S. official. But the official added:  In no way does this change the position that Jared and the Crown Prince evidently share that the main objective is reversing Iranian influence in Yemen and elsewhere.         On Lebanon, the U.S. message to Saudi Arabia about Hariri was conveyed in statements by Tillerson and in private conversations between U.S. and Saudi officials. Those officials included the Saudi state minister for Gulf affairs, Thamer al-Sabhan, who was in Washington recently, a senior administration official said.  We ve encouraged...the Saudis that it will be good for Lebanon s political stability for Hariri to return back to Beirut as soon as is practical,  the official said last week.     Hariri has since returned to Lebanon and shelved his decision to resign as prime minister, easing a crisis that had deepened tensions in the Middle East. Top Lebanese officials have said Saudi Arabia forced Hariri to quit and held him in the kingdom. Riyadh and Hariri deny this. ",

        "title": "Equatorial Guinea leader's son found guilty of embezzlement by French court",
        "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Millions of euros of assets belonging to the son of Equatorial Guinea s president were ordered to be seized by a French court that found him guilty in absentia on Friday of using money plundered from his country to buy property and luxury cars. The Paris court found Teodorin Obiang, 48, guilty of embezzlement, and ordered the confiscation of more than 100 million euros worth of his French assets. Obiang denied the charges. Obiang, eldest son of President Teodoro Obiang and a vice president himself, was also handed a three-year suspended prison sentence and a suspended 30 million euros ($34.78 million) fine. The court president cited the slow response from parts of the French banking system in contributing to those penalties being suspended and hence more lenient. The case is the first of several to reach court in a broader judicial investigation into allegations of illicit acquisitions in France by long-time leaders and family relatives in several African countries including Gabon and Congo Republic. Obiang s luxury residence on Paris  Avenue Foch - a grand, sweeping road near the Arc de Triomphe often favoured by wealthy African expatriates and politicians - was among the assets scrutinised during the trial. The property, bought for 25 million euros in 2005, had 101 rooms, a gym, hair-dressing studio and disco with cinema screen. Paris prosecutor Jean-Yves Lourgouilloux said Obiang s  fraudulent spending  amounted to more than 150 million euros. The court was critical of Societe Generale, France s second biggest bank, and the Bank of France, deeming them complacent towards Obiang s finances and too slow to react. The role of the two banks was taken into account to justify the suspended sentences for Obiang, the court said.  The attitude of Societe Generale, similar to that of the Bank of France, may have led (Obiang) to think for a long period of time that there was, in France, some kind of tolerance for these practices,  Benedicte de Perthuis, the most senior judge sitting in the case, told the court. Societe Generale said it had not been a party in the trial and  therefore we don t have any particular comment to make . Officials at the Bank of France did not immediately respond to a request for comment.     Obiang was first put on trial in January but the case, 10 years in the works, was postponed after his lawyers argued they had not had enough time to prepare his defence. His father, President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, has ruled Equatorial Guinea - a former Spanish colony - for more than three decades, making him one of Africa s longest-serving leaders, and rights groups have labelled his administration as one of the world s most corrupt.

        "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian troops exchanged gunfire on Wednesday with separatist guerrillas in a remote northeastern region bordering Myanmar, killing or wounding several of the insurgents, army officials said. The army was carrying out an operation against the separatist group, which is believed to have 2,000 guerrillas battling for an independent Greater Nagaland state carved out of India. An army patrol retaliated swiftly upon coming under heavy fire from the rebels, the Indian Army s eastern command, headquartered in the city of Kolkata, said in a statement.   Heavy casualties reportedly inflicted on NSCN-K cadre,  it said, using an acronym for the group, the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang.  No casualties suffered by Indian security forces.  Wednesday s operation was confined to the Indian side of the border, it added.   In 2015, Indian special forces crossed into Myanmar to hunt down guerrillas of the group who had taken shelter in the neighboring country.  That year the group launched a series of attacks on security forces in India s northeast, to scrap a ceasefire it had observed with New Delhi since 2001. In recent years, the militaries of India and Myanmar have built close ties, with each pledging not to allow insurgent groups to shelter in its territory.  India has condemned attacks in August by Rohingya insurgents on security posts in Myanmar s Rakhine state that provoked a military crackdown, causing hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims to flee the country.

        "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - Protesters at a Donald Trump rally in Kentucky last Tuesday have filed complaints with police claiming they were assaulted by Trump supporters, according to police and protesters. Henry Brousseau, 17, of Louisville, said he went to the Super Tuesday event at the Kentucky International Convention Center in Louisville to protest Trump\u2019s campaign and was punched in the stomach by a woman who was wearing a T-shirt of the Traditionalist Worker Party. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see how the police can find out who she is and hopefully we\u2019ll move on from there,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. Another protester, Molly Shah, 36, also of Louisville, said that she, too, had filed a complaint. Alicia Smiley, spokeswoman for the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department, said three complaints were filed on Wednesday and Thursday and were under review. These would mark the latest clashes between Trump supporters, security, and protesters. The day before Trump visited Louisville, black students were removed from a rally in Georgia. A website for the Traditionalist Worker Party describes it as a grassroots political organization that believes, among other things, that \u201cEuropean-American identity is under constant attack.\u201d   The Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit civil rights and public interest advocacy organization that monitors groups it considers extremist, classifies the Traditionalist Worker Party as a white nationalist hate group, said Ryan Lentz, a writer and researcher for the center. Brousseau, who is white and transgender, said he joined people from Black Lives Matter, Parents for Social Justice, Showing Up for Racial Justice and other groups that went to the Trump rally to protest.  Video footage that has been circulated on social and traditional media shows people in Traditionalist Worker Party t-shirts pushing people, notably a young black woman, and taking their protest signs. Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email that the campaign does not comment on security matters.  The Traditionalist Worker Party did not respond to requests for comment, and its website, tradworker.org, does not say where it is based.   Matthew Heimbach, the group\u2019s chairman, wrote in a blog on the website of the Traditionalist Youth Network that the protesters, including those from Black Lives Matter, were the aggressors. And he tweeted, \u201cIts (sic) funny how BLM comes to a Trump event to fight, starts the fight and then loses the fight but plays big victims to the media.\u201d  Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Lentz said, \u201cMatthew is a figure who is core to the white nationalists and white supremacist culture as it is right now in the U.S.\u201d  For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, \u201cTales from the Trail\u201d (here).

        "text": "LOME (Reuters) - Four people were killed in Togo on Wednesday in clashes between security forces and demonstrators calling for an end to a half century of Gnassingbe family rule, the security minister said. Opposition activists have been demonstrating since August against Gnassingbe s administration and say a constitutional reform he has proposed would allow him to rule the West African country until 2030. Colonel Damehame Yark, the security and civil protection minister, told a news conference that one person was shot dead and around sixty others arrested in the capital, Lome. Another three died of gunshot wounds in the second-biggest city, Sokode.  These are too many deaths. We d be wise to preserve the peace,  he said.  The latest bout of protests followed the arrest in Sokode on Monday of a Muslim imam accused of urging his followers to murder soldiers. Clashes erupted after the arrest. A crowd killed two soldiers and one other person died in unspecified circumstances, the government said in a statement. About 20 other people were injured, it added.  The deaths reignited a mass protest movement against President Faure Gnassingbe, who succeeded his late father Gnassingbe Eyadema in 2005.  The protesters are calling for his resignation.  We deplore this toll and we say that backing down is out of the question. Despite what we have suffered, we will maintain our call for protests tomorrow,  said Brigitte Adjamagbo, one of the leaders of the opposition movement.  She said the coalition was aware of two people killed, including an 11-year-old child, as well as twenty others who were seriously injured and dozens of arrests. In a bid to curb demonstrations, the government has banned marches and mass protests on weekdays. But young protesters in Be, a working-class neighborhood in eastern Lome, defied the ban on Wednesday. They erected barricades with bricks and burning tyres and threw stones at security forces, who responded with volleys of tear gas.   This is our last bastion,  shouted one demonstrator, Ayi Koffi.  We have no arms, no gas. We do not have cars to pick up people. We have come out barehanded to say, enough!  In a statement, the International Organisation of La Francophonie, a group comprised mainly of French-speaking countries including Paris s former colonies, said that nothing justified the violence.  Dialogue must be prioritised in all circumstances,  it said. The controversial constitutional reform will be decided by popular referendum after the bill failed to win approval from parliament following a boycott by opposition lawmakers last month.  ",

Units from the Iraqi army, Counter-Terrorism Services, Sunni tribal and Iranian-backed Popular Mobilisation forces (PMF) are participating in an offensive to recapture al-Qaim and Rawa, two towns which lie on the border area with Syria.  Iraq s security forces retook a border crossing with Syria from the militants, hours after entering al-Qaim, according to the Joint Operations Command. The road runs through al-Qaim in Iraq and Albu-Kamal in Syria, two towns which are very close to each other on opposite sides of the border in the last important territorial stronghold of Islamic State. Welcoming the offensive, the U.S.-led international military coalition, which has run an air campaign against Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq since 2014, said in a statement that approximately 1,500 Islamic State fighters were estimated to remain in the immediate vicinity of al-Qaim. Operations to clear the militants from their final strongholds in Iraq have continued, despite a concurrent military advance on Kurdish-held territory in the north. Iraq s central government launched an offensive on Oct. 16 to seize disputed territories, claimed by both Baghdad and the Kurds, in retaliation for a referendum on Kurdish independence held on Sept. 25. In a lightning strike, central government forces swiftly recaptured large areas, including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, from the Kurds, who had seized these areas when Islamic State swept across northern Iraq in 2014. On Thursday, Iraqi forces threatened to resume military operations against the Kurds, accusing them of delaying the handover of control of borders and taking advantage of negotiations to bolster their defenses.

But there was no sign that Republicans would abandon their $1.1 billion measure, raising the chance that Congress will leave the growing health crisis unattended until September.  In a conference call, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the lack of funding has made it difficult for the health agency to ramp up mosquito-control and diagnostic testing and pursue new research. President Barack Obama asked the Republican-controlled Congress in February for $1.9 billion in emergency funding to fight Zika. But as lawmakers prepare to leave for a seven-week recess on July 15, Senate Democrats who defeated the Republican measure last week predict it will only fail again. \u201cWe are at the 11th hour and 59th minute before Congress is gone all summer,\u201d said Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, which is among a number of southern U.S. states likely to be hard-hit by the Zika virus. U.S. health officials say Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.  Over the past few days, Obama has urged Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democrats to adopt a bipartisan approach. On Thursday, Democrats called on McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan to revive a bipartisan measure that passed the Senate in May. McConnell has said he would stick with the current legislation, which was agreed by House and Senate negotiators and has already passed the House.  A senior Senate Republican aide dismissed the call for change as \u201ccover\u201d for Democratic efforts to block the Republican measure. A Ryan spokeswoman said: \u201cWe hope Senate Democrats do the right thing and end their filibuster.\u201d Even some Democratic aides expressed skepticism that McConnell or Ryan would change course.        The CDC is monitoring 320 pregnant U.S. women with laboratory evidence of Zika infection. In Puerto Rico, where Zika has been rampant for months, as many as 50 pregnant women are infected every day, CDC Director Thomas Frieden said. Altogether, there are more than 1,130 Zika cases in the United States, the CDC said. All contracted the virus outside the United States, in a lab or through unprotected sex.  Frieden said the CDC has spent most of the $222 million it has received for Zika in the United States on state and municipal efforts, funding, staffing and equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s frankly difficult to navigate with so many unknowns,\u201d Frieden said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we haven\u2019t been able to do things like begin ramping up centers of excellence to improve the performance of diagnostic tests, of mosquito control and to begin some of the really in-depth studies.\u201d Additional funding would also aid vaccine research and help community health centers in areas with the highest Zika transmission rates.  The Republican measure failed in the Senate on June 28 when Democrats objected to Republican provisions, including one to prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving funds to combat what can be sexually transmitted infection. The legislation would also take money from battling the Ebola virus and from funds set aside to implement the Obamacare health insurance program in U.S. territories. \u201cThey\u2019ll force yet another failed vote on this cynical legislation and then pack their bags for the longest Senate vacation since 1954,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults. The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last fall in Brazil, which has now confirmed more than 1,600 cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to Zika infections in the mothers.

        "text": "ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (Reuters) - Pope Francis said the recent spate of hurricanes should prompt people to understand that humanity will  go down  if it does not address climate change and history will judge those who deny the science on its causes.  If we don t turn back, we will go down,  Francis told reporters on Sunday on the plane returning from Colombia. Francis strongly backed the 2015 Paris agreement on reducing global warming, from which the United States withdrew this year. Francis spoke as hurricane Irma pounded central Florida as it carved through the state with high winds, storm surges and torrential rains that left millions without power, ripped roofs off homes and flooded city streets. Francis was asked about recent hurricanes, including Irma and Harvey, and if political leaders who do not want to work with other countries to stem global warming should be held morally responsible for future effects on the planet.  You can see the effects of climate change and scientists have clearly said what path we have to follow,  he said, referring to a consensus by scientists that global warming is caused by human activity such as fossil fuels.  All of us have a responsibility, all of us, small or large, a moral responsibility. We have to take it seriously. We can t joke about it,  he said.  Each person has their own. Even politicians have their own.  Ahead of the Paris summit in 2015, Francis wrote a major encyclical, or papal letter, on the care of the environment which backed the gradual elimination of fossil fuels to stem global warming. The accord, agreed on by nearly 200 countries, aims to cut emissions blamed for global warming. The United States committed to reducing its own by 26 to 28 percent, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. Many world leaders criticized Trump for pulling out.  If someone is doubtful that this is true, they should ask scientists. They are very clear. These are not opinions made on the fly.  They are very clear. Then each person can decide and history will judge the decisions,  he said. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris agreement shortly after visiting the Vatican in May. The Vatican had urged him to stay in the accord. A Vatican official said at the time that the U.S. move was a  slap in the face  for the pope and the Vatican. ",

The deal has caused concern in the West because Turkey is a member of NATO but the Russian missile system cannot be integrated into NATO s military architecture. In addition, relations between Moscow and the Western military alliance are strained, in part because of Russia s annexation of Ukraine s Crimea peninsula. Turkish Defence Minister Nurettin Canikli said Ankara would purchase two S-400 systems and four batteries and that all agreements were made, the state broadcaster TRT Haber reported. Turkey will pay 45 percent of the cost up front with Russia providing loans to cover the remaining 55 percent, Chemezov said. Moscow expected to begin the first deliveries in March 2020, he said. Chemezov told Kommersant that Turkey was the first NATO member state to acquire the advanced S-400 missile system. He said the Russian and Turkish finance ministries had already completed talks on financing the deal and that the final documents just needed to be approved. ",

        "title": "Republicans propose bill to privatize U.S. air traffic control",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 Transportation Committee on Wednesday proposed legislation to privatize the U.S. air traffic control system and make other aviation changes, but it faces an uncertain future in Congress. The panel plans to consider the bill next Tuesday, and the full House will vote in mid-July, said the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, Representative Bill Shuster. \u201cThis is about saving the taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d Shuster told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cMaintaining the status quo is unacceptable.\u201d The legislation would make it illegal for an airline to bump an already boarded passenger from a flight. In April, a United Airlines passenger was forcibly removed from his seat, prompting public outrage. The airline banned the practice.\t The bill would also require the U.S. Transportation Department to clarify regulations for compensating passengers, including that there is no maximum compensation, and would legally bar the use of cellphones and other mobile devices for phone calls during flights. No airline currently allows in-flight calls from personal phones. In April, the Federal Communications Commission said it planned to halt a regulatory process that could have led to in-flight calls on airplanes. The legislation also requires large and medium-sized airports to provide clean private rooms in all terminals for nursing mothers.  Airlines would have to post a prominent link on their website on services offered in the event of a widespread computer outage. Many airlines have been hit by computer system outages over the last year. The most controversial proposal is the privatization of air traffic control. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump unveiled a plan to modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. Under the proposal, air traffic control would be spun off from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and put under the oversight of a nonprofit corporation. Congressman Shuster said airlines would have three seats on the 13-member board: one for major airlines, one for cargo carriers and one for regional airlines. The Trump administration has proposed giving airlines two seats on the board, while Shuster last year proposed giving airlines four seats. Shuster aims to address concerns among private plane owners and rural airports by barring the new air traffic control entity from charging general aviation operators user fees.  Critics say the plan would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines. A coalition of five general aviation groups said in a statement on Wednesday that they would not support the bill, saying it was \u201cfundamentally flawed.\u201d The Airline Owners and Pilots Association said the bill has a \u201chigh potential for unintended consequences as well as increased costs and uncertainty.\u201d Shuster\u2019s bill would reauthorize the FAA for six years and also has provisions to speed up a decision by the Transportation Department on whether to allow expanded commercial drone use. The Transportation Department would also have to consider whether to require airlines to stock emergency medicine for children aboard flights. The legislation would also authorize significantly higher funding for a program that subsidizes commercial air service to rural airports, which the Trump administration budget proposed eliminating. The Senate Commerce Committee\u2019s chairman, Senator John Thune, said on Tuesday that he was not planning to include air traffic control privatization in the FAA reauthorization, a committee aide said. The administration and Shuster say they would not charge the private entity for the government\u2019s air traffic control assets and would bar Congress from reviewing fees charged by the board. Executives from United, Hawaiian Airlines Inc, American Airlines Inc and Southwest Airlines Co, strongly back the proposal. The FAA spends nearly $10 billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees, and has spent more than $7.5 billion on next-generation air traffic control reforms in recent years. It is unclear whether privatization would speed the rollout of new systems such as satellite-based aircraft tracking that replaces ground radar dating back to World War Two. ",

        "title": "U.S. consumer agency defends student loan reforms from Republican attacks",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. consumer financial watchdog on Thursday attempted to repel a Trump-administration attack on former President Barack Obama\u2019s sweeping student loan reforms and defended itself against Republican attempts to weaken its powers. In a lengthy letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said it had complied with its remit, despite her department\u2019s charges to the contrary. The Education Department announced last week it would no longer work with the bureau on resolving student loan complaints, saying it had complicated the lending process \u201cwith potentially inaccurate and inconsistent directives.\u201d  It said the consumer bureau, created after the 2007-09 financial crisis to protect individuals from predatory lending, was not honoring an agreement to promptly refer complaints to the department, but using the department\u2019s data \u201cto expand its jurisdiction into areas that Congress never envisioned.\u201d  The Obama-appointed head of the watchdog, Democrat Richard Cordray, said the bureau shares complaint information in \u201cnear real-time\u201d through an on-line portal with the department. It has \u201cnot exceeded its authority,\u201d and only fulfilled its mission under federal law to monitor and respond to individuals\u2019 complaints about debts as well as enforce federal consumer law, Cordray wrote.  Congress created the bureau in part to mediate between consumers and credit card companies, banks, mortgage providers and other lenders. The dispute goes beyond a mere territory fight. Republicans revile the CFPB, saying it reaches too far in its rules and enforcement and should be more accountable to lawmakers. Democrats have said it helps ensure fair treatment for middle-class people unable to fight fraud on their own.  Republicans also disapprove of Obama\u2019s attempt to make college more affordable by moving almost all of the $1.4 trillion student-loan industry into the federal government. Currently, only servicing is handled outside the Education Department.  During last year\u2019s elections, Trump and fellow Republicans promised to \u201cget government out of the business of lending\u201d and DeVos is now working to return much of the process to the private sector. She also wants to redo other Obama-era regulations, such as protections for sexual-assault victims on college campuses. DeVos critics consider the department\u2019s split from the CFPB as a way to protect for-profit schools, debt collectors and servicers from government intervention. Earlier this year the bureau, which has received nearly 20,000 complaints about student loan servicers since February 2016, sued the country\u2019s largest servicer Navient Corp for systematically failing borrowers. Navient disputes the allegations and is contesting them in court.  ",

        "title": "U.S., backed by China, proposes tough N.Korea sanctions at U.N.",
        "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States presented a draft Security Council resolution on Thursday it negotiated with China that would dramatically tighten existing restrictions on North Korea after its Jan. 6 nuclear test and create the toughest U.N. sanctions regime in over two decades. The draft, seen by Reuters, would require U.N. member states to conduct mandatory inspections of all cargo passing through their territory to or from North Korea to look for illicit goods. Previously states were only required to do this if they had reasonable grounds to believe there was illicit cargo. The United States used the nearly two months of bilateral negotiations that at one point involved President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, diplomats said, to win China\u2019s support for unusually tough measures intended to persuade its ally North Korea to abandon its atomic weapons program. The proposal would close a gap in the U.N. arms embargo on Pyongyang by banning all weapons imports and exports.  There would also be an unprecedented ban on the transfer to North Korea of any item that could directly contribute to the operational capabilities of the North Korean armed forces, such as trucks that could be modified for military purposes. Other proposed measures include a ban on all supplies of aviation and rocket fuel to North Korea, a requirement for states to expel North Korean diplomats engaging in illicit activities, and blacklisting 17 North Korean individuals and 12 entities, including the National Aerospace Development Agency or \u2018NADA\u2019, the body responsible for February\u2019s rocket launch.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power told reporters the new measures, if approved, would be \u201cthe strongest set of sanctions imposed by the Security Council in more than two decades.\u201d Several council diplomats predicted a Saturday meeting to adopt the draft but Russian deputy U.N. ambassador Petr Iliichev told Reuters Moscow needed time to study the draft and the earliest likely vote would be next week. The draft was the result of seven weeks of tough negotiations between the United States and China, North Korea\u2019s neighbor and main ally. \u201cThis is a very robust resolution,\u201d a U.S. official said on condition of anonymity. \u201cClearly this took a long time ... it was a difficult process.\u201d North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 because of its multiple nuclear tests and rocket launches. China and the United States had differed on how strongly to respond to Pyongyang\u2019s most recent test, with Washington urging harsh punitive measures and Beijing emphasizing dialogue and milder U.N. steps confined to non-proliferation. The Global Times, an influential Chinese tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party, said in an editorial that North Korea \u201cdeserves the punishment\u201d of new sanctions, but China should \u201ccushion Washington\u2019s harsh sanctions to some extent.\u201d  \u201cChina insists the sanctions should focus on striking North Korea\u2019s ability to continue developing nuclear weapons. It is the fundamental difference between China\u2019s policy and that of the U.S., South Korea and Japan. China holds unswerving goodwill toward North Korea, which Chinese society hopes Pyongyang can understand,\u201d it said. Diplomats said a sharp tightening of restrictions was necessary since Pyongyang has proved its determination to flout at all costs attempts at constraining its nuclear and missile programs.  They said they hoped the latest measures would make it harder for North Korea to continue with that policy, keeping up the pressure on the country\u2019s leadership without making the country\u2019s impoverished population any poorer. \u201cPyongyang has prioritized the pursuit of these massively expensive programs over absolutely everything else,\u201d the U.S. official said. \u201cSo is New York action going to automatically convince the regime\u2019s leaders to cease? I think we\u2019re realistic on that point.\u201d However, he added that \u201cthis resolution will be felt, it will have an impact ... The DPRK (North Korea) have never been subject to the kind of pressure that is in the resolution.\u201d  Power said the measures were aimed at the country\u2019s leadership, and \u201ccareful not to punish the North Korean people.\u201d In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press briefing on Thursday: \u201cWe hope and believe this new resolution can help effectively constrain North Korea from further developing its nuclear missile program\u201d. There will also be further restrictions aimed at making it more difficult for North Korea to press ahead with its nuclear and missile programs. Pyongyang is currently banned from importing and exporting nuclear and missile technology and is not allowed to import luxury goods. The list of banned items will be expanded. The U.S. official said one of five annexes to the resolution lists 31 ships owned by North Korean shipping firm Ocean Maritime Management Company Limited, which will be blacklisted.  Also new, countries will be required, not just encouraged, to freeze the assets of North Korean entities linked to Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear or missile programs and to prohibit the opening of new branches or offices of North Korean banks or to engage in banking correspondence with North Korean banks.

        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin joked on Thursday that if former FBI director James Comey suffers persecution because of his falling-out with U.S. President Donald Trump, Russia is ready to grant him asylum. The offer, made with Putin\u2019s trademark sardonic humor, came as the Russian president poured scorn on Comey for his role in a row in Washington over alleged Russian meddling in last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election. At a congressional hearing this month, Comey said Trump asked him to drop an investigation into contacts between Trump associates and Russian officials, while the U.S. president has accused Comey of not telling the truth. Asked about Comey at a question-and-answer session with Russian voters, Putin said it was \u201cstrange\u201d that, while still FBI director, Comey had passed the contents of a conversation he had with Trump to the media via a friend. \u201cWhat is the difference then between the FBI director and Mr. Snowden?\u201d Putin said, referring to former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia in 2013 after leaking classified information about U.S. spy operations. \u201cIn this case, he (Comey) is not the head of a special service but a human rights activist who defends a certain position,\u201d Putin said. \u201cBy the way, if he is subject to any sort of persecution in connection with this, we will be ready to give him political asylum in Russia. And he should know about this.\u201d Striking a more serious note, Putin said Comey, in his congressional testimony, had produced no proof that Russia had meddled in the U.S. election. \u201cI am not familiar in detail with the testimony given by former FBI director Comey,\u201d Putin said. \u201cAgain, he gave no evidence of this (Russian interference).\u201d \u201cAnd what about constant U.S. propaganda, constant U.S. support of America-oriented non-governmental organizations by giving them money directly? Isn\u2019t it an impact on our minds? Isn\u2019t it an attempt to influence how we should behave during election campaigns? This continues year after year,\u201d he said. Putin said many heads of state around the world had told him of similar U.S. meddling in their internal affairs. But they would not voice their concerns openly, fearing they would \u201cspoil relations\u201d with Washington, he said.  As for Russia, \u201cwe have an opinion of our own, we express it openly. But this is not any sort of underground, subversive activity\u201d, Putin said. ",

He said it would be \u201can absolute shame if a man of this quality\u201d was blocked by Democrats and to avoid that eventuality, \u201cI would say it\u2019s up to Mitch, but I would say, \u2018Go for it.\u201d ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House named a new adviser to President Barack Obama on climate and energy at the National Security Council, a spokesman said on Wednesday. The adviser, John Morton, was previously the chief operating officer at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.  He replaces Paul Bodnar, who helped push for cooperation between the United States and China on climate and for a global agreement at climate talks in Paris last year. Morton, who began his career at the World Bank, takes the job after the Supreme Court this month put a hold on Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan to cut emissions from power plants, a major part of the president\u2019s strategy to fight climate change. The death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia four days later may have opened a path for the rule\u2019s survival. But the administration\u2019s plan could face other legal hurdles from Republicans and fossil fuel interests during Obama\u2019s last year in office. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is likely to make a stop in China in November during his first official visit to Asia, a U.S. official said on Tuesday, a trip that will come amid tensions over North Korea s nuclear tests. Washington and its allies have said there is a growing urgency for China, North Korea s top ally and trading partner, to apply more pressure on its already isolated neighbor to get it to back down on its nuclear weapons and missiles programs. Chinese President Xi Jinping had invited Trump to visit China during their meeting in April in Palm Beach, Florida. The two leaders also met on the sidelines on the G20 summit in July. Trump is set to attend the U.S.-ASEAN summit and the East Asia summit in the Philippines in November, as well as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam. China s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Trump s potential visit. Japanese public broadcaster NHK cited unnamed diplomatic sources saying that Trump was also considering visiting Japan and South Korea during his Asian tour in November. In February, Trump accepted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s invitation to visit Japan by the end of the year.  The February agreement is still valid. We would definitely like to make it happen sometime within this year. But no specific timing has been fixed yet,  a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said. Also, the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun said on Wednesday Japan, the United States and South Korea are in final stages of talks to hold a trilateral summit on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. The newspaper, citing unnamed government sources, reported the meeting between Trump, Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in could take place on Sept. 21 and would focus on bolstering cooperation in response to North Korean provocation. On Monday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously voted to step up sanctions on North Korea, with its profitable textile exports now banned and fuel supplies capped. After several days of negotiations on the resolution, Washington dropped several measures to win the support of Russia and China, including a bid for an oil embargo and the blacklisting of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the national airline. In Hong Kong, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told the South China Morning Post the results of a U.S.-led investigation into alleged Chinese intellectual property theft would be announced before the Beijing summit to reset bilateral trade. The far-right architect of Trump s 2016 election victory, Bannon told an investor conference, organized by a unit of China s largest brokerage, that Trump and Xi had a rapport that should enable them to work out differences, said an attendee at the meeting which was closed to the press. Bannon, who was let go by Trump last month, told a private lunch gathering in Hong Kong that he still  speaks with President Donald Trump every two to three days,  the Wall Street Journal reported.

        "title": "White House: more Obama regulation rollbacks coming",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump hopes to sign \u201cseveral more\u201d measures into law before the end of April to roll back Obama-era regulations under the time-limited Congressional Review Act (CRA), a White House official said on Wednesday. Aggressive use by Republicans in Congress of the obscure CRA has provided them with several small-scale legislative victories at a time when they have struggled with major legislation.  Highlighting these, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short said on a conference call with reporters: \u201cThere are several more that we hope to sign before this window closes on April 28.\u201d The law has a short time span for introducing resolutions of disapproval: 60 legislative days after a regulation is finalized, meaning it can only be used shortly after a president of an opposing party leaves office. Since Trump, a Republican, took office on Jan. 20, House of Representatives Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy has led Congress in churning out 13 resolutions killing regulations by Democratic President Barack Obama, most of concern to business interests. Trump, who vowed in the 2016 election campaign to slash regulations, has signed 11 resolutions under the CRA, rolling back the rules they targeted and barring agencies from writing \u201csubstantially similar\u201d measures in the future. On Monday, Trump signed a CRA resolution repealing broadband privacy protections. He has also signed resolutions killing rules meant to expand background checks for mentally ill gun purchasers, change public school assessments, and reduce coal waste runoff into streams. Democrats have assailed the reversals as harmful to the environment, education and checks on Wall Street, with many saying the measures were meant to please big-money lobbyists. Last Friday was the deadline for introducing new CRA resolutions. Now Republicans must complete voting on resolutions already in the legislative pipeline. Written in 1996 and successfully used only once before 2017, the CRA was meant to restore the balance of power between Congress and the federal bureaucracy. But lobbyists and lawmakers have seized on it as a tool to repeal rules written in the final months of a preceding administration. The U.S. government has thousands of regulations, which are categorized by their impact on the economy. The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, has reported that 76 \u201cmajor\u201d new rules, subject to CRA review, were written in 2015, down from 81 in 2014. The busiest year on record for major new rules was 100 in 2010. ",

        "title": "Supreme Court justice temporarily preserves Trump refugee ban",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy on Monday provided a temporary reprieve for President Trump s order blocking most refugees from entering the United States, putting on hold a lower court s ruling loosening the prohibition. Kennedy s action gave the nine justices more time to consider the Justice Department s challenge filed on Monday to the lower court s decision allowing entry to refugees from around the world if they had a formal offer from a resettlement agency. The full Supreme Court could act within days. The Justice Department opted not to appeal another part of last Thursday s ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that related to Trump s ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority nations. The 9th Circuit ruling broadened the number of people with exemptions to the ban to include grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins of legal U.S. residents. Without Kennedy s intervention, the appeals court decision would have gone into effect on Tuesday. Kennedy asked refugee ban challengers to file a response to the Trump administration s filing by noon on Tuesday. Under the 9th U.S. Circuit s ruling, up to 24,000 additional refugees would become eligible to enter the United States than otherwise would be allowed, according to the administration. Trump s March 6 order banned travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days in a move the Republican president argued was needed to prevent terrorist attacks. The order, which replaced a broader January one that was blocked by federal courts, was one of the most contentious acts of his presidency. Critics called it an unlawful  Muslim ban  that made good on Trump s promise as a candidate of  a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  The broader question of whether the travel ban discriminates against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution, as lower courts previously ruled, will be argued before the Supreme Court on Oct. 10. The Supreme Court in June partially revived the order after its provisions were blocked by lower courts. But the justices said a ban could be applied only to those without a  bona fide  relationship to people or entities in the United States. New litigation was brought by Hawaii over the meaning of that phrase, including whether written assurances by resettlement agencies obligating them to provide services for specific refugees would count. Hawaii and other Democratic-led states, the American Civil Liberties Union and refugee groups filed legal challenges after Trump signed his order in March.  The Trump administration has ended its odd and ill-advised quest to ban grandmas from the country,  Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said on Monday.  With respect to the admission to the United States of refugees with formal assurances and the Supreme Court s temporary stay order, each day matters,  Chin added, promising to respond soon to the administration s filing. In court papers filed earlier on Monday, the Justice Department said the 9th Circuit refugees decision  will disrupt the status quo and frustrate orderly implementation of the order s refugee provisions.  Omar Jadwat, an ACLU lawyer, contrasted Trump s efforts to keep alive his travel ban with the Republican president s decision last week to rescind a program that protected from deportation people brought to the United States illegally as children, dubbed  Dreamers.   The extraordinary efforts the administration is taking in pursuit of the Muslim ban stand in stark contrast to its unwillingness to take a single step to protect 800,000 Dreamers,  Jadwat said. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will raise the issue of defense spending during his trip to Ottawa on Friday, a senior U.S. Treasury official said.  Earlier this week, Canada unveiled plans to bulk up its military amid doubts that it could continue to rely on the United States as the world\u2019s foremost global leader. [nL1N1J418R] \u201cI expect we\u2019d cover issues related to defense spending and we saw of course Canada\u2019s recent announcements just in the last couple of days about that,\u201d the senior Treasury official said in a conference call with reporters on Thursday. President Donald Trump has scolded NATO allies, which includes Canada, for not spending enough on defense and has so far declined to personally affirm the alliance\u2019s mutual defense doctrine. While in Ottawa, Mnuchin is scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting with Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau. Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell will accompany Mnuchin on the trip, Treasury said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said that Mnuchin would raise trade issues with his Canadian counterpart. Tensions between the traditionally close allies have been rising over the Trump administration\u2019s accusations of unfair trade practices by its northern neighbor. The United States and Canada will soon begin talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA). Mexico is also a member of the pact. During Friday\u2019s talks, the United States wants to get a sense of Canada\u2019s thoughts on timing and issues on trade before starting negotiations, the senior Treasury official said. Canada is already at odds with the United States over dairy subsidies, as well as exports of lumber and airliners. Mnuchin is expected to raise tax reform, financial regulation and countering terrorist financing as part of the discussions, the senior Treasury official added. ",

Asked if the report had undercut his confidence in his nominee to head the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Representative Tom Marino, Trump said: \u201cI have not spoken to him, but I will speak to him, and I\u2019ll make that determination. \u201cIf I think it\u2019s 1 percent negative to doing what we want to do, I will make a change, yes,\u201d he added. Marino\u2019s office did not immediately return a request for comment. The report by the Washington Post and CBS described how Marino introduced and helped push through industry-backed legislation that undercut the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s ability to freeze suspicious shipments of pain pills from drug companies.  A number of Democrats called for Trump to abandon his nominee in the wake of the report. \u201cCongressman Marino no longer has my trust or that of the public that he will aggressively pursue the fight against opioid abuse,\u201d Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said in a statement. Manchin\u2019s state of West Virginia has been hit hard by the opioid crisis.

The level of violence in society is growing and the fraternity cannot simply ignore that, that thousands of people are dying , Alpha Phi Omega spokesperson Thomas Roca said, when asked why the fraternity picked the protest theme this year.   Since taking office last June, Duterte has launched a ferocious war of drugs that has left thousands of Filipinos dead, and in May, he imposed martial law in Mindanao, an island of 22 million people, when Islamic State-linked militants took over large parts of the city of Marawi. This is not the first time the fraternity has taken a political stance with its yearly bare-bottomed event.  The society used its naked run during the rule of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the 1980s to protest against the censorship of activists at the University of the Philippines.

        "title": "Amid hacking row, pressure builds on Trump to soften pro-Russia rhetoric",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump is finding himself caught between his desire to improve relations with Russia and fellow Republicans who are pushing for a harsher response to what American spy agencies say was the Kremlin\u2019s meddling in the U.S. presidential election. The tacit acknowledgement on Sunday by his incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, that Russia was behind the hacking of Democratic Party organizations suggests that Trump\u2019s maneuvering room could be shrinking. Trump has long been dismissive of the U.S. intelligence conclusion that Russia was behind the election hacks, which Russia has denied, or was trying to help him win the November ballot, saying the intrusions could have been carried out by China or a 400-pound hacker sitting on his bed. But following a report from U.S. intelligence agencies last week blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia experts say Trump will face growing calls for a stiff military, diplomatic, economic, and perhaps also covert response after his Jan. 20 inauguration.  \u201cThe new U.S. administration will need to adopt a significantly tougher line,\u201d said Nile Gardiner of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington that is an influential voice in Trump\u2019s transition team.     Republicans in Congress wary of Trump\u2019s push for detente with Putin could pressure the new president to withhold the thing the Russian leader wants most: a rapid easing of the economic sanctions imposed after Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, the Russia experts said. U.S. intelligence agencies say that since the election, Russian spies have turned to hacking other individuals and organizations, including prominent think-tanks, in what analysts think is an effort to gain insights into future U.S. policies. Washington\u2019s Brookings Institution, which is headed by prominent Russia expert Strobe Talbott, \u201creceived a big wave of attacks the day after the election,\u201d but there is no reason to believe its systems have been compromised, said David Nassar, the think tank\u2019s vice president for communications.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he and fellow Republican John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, would introduce legislation with stronger sanctions than the ones now in place. \u201cWe\u2019re going to introduce sanctions that ... will hit them in the financial sector and the energy sector, where they\u2019re the weakest,\u201d Graham told NBC television\u2019s Meet the Press. Retired Marine General James Mattis, the nominee for secretary of defense who will face a Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday, is expected to advocate a stronger line against Moscow than the one Trump outlined during his election campaign.That could put him at odds with Trump\u2019s national security adviser, retired Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who has had warmer relations with Putin\u2019s government, and with Rex Tillerson, the nominee for secretary of state, who as CEO of ExxonMobil had extensive business ties with Russia. If Mattis does push for a tougher approach to Russia, that could empower U.S. advocates for strengthening the American military presence in Europe. That could include reinforcing U.S. troops in the Baltic states and Poland, analysts say. NATO already plans to deploy 4,000 additional troops, planes, tanks and artillery to the three former Soviet republics in the Baltics and Poland this year. \u201cThere is nervousness about Trump among Europeans at NATO,\u201d said one European diplomat. \u201cAny grand bargain with Russia would fundamentally change NATO\u2019s course and threaten Europe with disunity,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t expect that. NATO is seeking to reassure Baltic allies, and the United States is a big part of the deterrent.\u201d  Some advocates of a sterner response to the Russian hacking say it should include cyber counterattacks, perhaps by leaking financial information embarrassing to some of Putin\u2019s aides and close associates. So far, the Obama administration has refrained from such action, at least publicly, for fear that it could lead to an escalating cyberwar that could threaten critical infrastructure such as financial transactions and energy transmission. Although Trump has said the nation needed to \u201cmove on to bigger and better things\u201d following the U.S. disclosure of alleged Russian hacking, it appears that Republican and Democratic lawmakers are unlikely to drop the issue anytime soon. McCain told NBC he wanted to create a select committee to investigate the Russian hacking, if he can convince the Republican-controlled Senate\u2019s leaders to charge their minds.  In the meantime, he said, key Senate committees, including Armed Services and Intelligence, will investigate. Experts say the close scrutiny of Russia\u2019s actions will come just as Trump\u2019s administration starts to craft a comprehensive strategy on the former Cold War foe. It is likely to be weeks or longer before a clear sense of Trump\u2019s actual Russia strategy comes into view. \u201cUntil there\u2019s a team in place, until there\u2019s a little more organization \u2026 I tend to think we\u2019re not going to have clear answers,\u201d said Heather Conley, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

        "text": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A hardline Pakistani Islamist group called off nationwide protests on Monday after the government met its demand that a government minister accused of blasphemy resign, following weekend clashes with police that paralyzed major cities. The cleric-politician leading the nearly three-week blockade of the capital, Islamabad, thanked the army chief for helping resolve the stand-off, raising questions about the military s role. The new ultra-religious political party Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan was protesting against a small change in wording to an electoral law changing a religious oath to a simple declaration, which it said amounted to blasphemy. The government climbdown will be seen as an embarrassment for the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party ahead of elections likely in mid-2018, and underlines the power of religious groups in the nuclear-armed nation of 207 million. Seven people were killed and nearly 200 wounded after a police bid to disperse protesters in Islamabad failed on Saturday, spurring demonstrators wielding sticks and iron rods to block key roads and motorways in other cities.  Our main demand has been accepted,  Ejaz Ashrafi, spokesman for Tahreek-e-Labaik, told Reuters, adding that part of the agreement was to free dozens of party workers arrested during the weekend crackdown.  Our workers  release is in process. Once that is done, we will leave.  At nightfall on Monday, the protesters were still in place. Law minister Zahid Hamid handed in his resignation to Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi  to take the country out of a crisis-like situation , state-run news channel PTV said on Monday.  Government spokesmen did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment. The government called in the military to tackle the protests after a police operation failed, but there was no sign of troops around protest camps on Sunday. The military said the army chief in one telephone call had advised Abbasi to resolve the protests peacefully. Tehreek-e-Labaik leader Khadim Hussain Rizvi on Monday described the army s role in ending the standoff.  The honorable chief of army staff, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, sent his special envoys to us. We said we do not want to talk to the government; they are our murderers,  Rizvi said.  So the general took personal interest and sent his team, saying  we will become the guarantors, and have your demands fulfilled . So we said,  All right. That is what we want.     For more than two weeks, Tehreek-e-Labaik activists have blocked the main road into the capital, Islamabad, in a protest that blamed law minister Hamid for changing the wording in an electoral oath. The party says the words  I believe , used to replace the clause  I solemnly swear  in a proclamation of Mohammad as the religion s last prophet, amount to blasphemy. The government blamed the change on a clerical error and swiftly restored the original format. Insulting Islam s prophet is punishable by death under Pakistani law, and blasphemy accusations stir such emotions that they are difficult to defend against. Even a rumor of blasphemy can spark mob violence, as in the case of a university student beaten to death in April. Labaik, one of two new ultra-religious political movements to reach prominence in recent months, has made defending the blasphemy laws a campaign centerpiece with some success. The party won a surprisingly strong 6 percent and 7.6 percent share of votes in two recent by-elections. Islamist parties are unlikely to win a majority in the elections expected next August, but could play a major role.   Giving in to the group s demands had hit the government s reputation and credibility, said political analyst Hasan Askari.  These protests will have emboldened this group, and they are going to assert themselves and put up candidates wherever they can in the next general election, or at least they will oppose the PML-N,  he added. The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party accused the government of bungling the efforts to remove the protesters and called for early elections. ",

        "title": "Trump defends Boeing tweet, says companies shouldn't worry",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday defended his direct interventions with companies, including making statements on Twitter, saying businesses will benefit from his actions and his upcoming term in office.  One day after criticizing one of Boeing Co\u2019s high-profile projects in a tweet, Trump told NBC that he anticipated \u201ctremendous\u201d economic growth under his administration but reiterated his warning that companies shifting U.S. jobs overseas would have to pay.   Still, markets and companies should not worry, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know ... how people are unnerved,\u201d Trump told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d program. \u201cIt\u2019s just the opposite. Frankly, I think we\u2019re going to go up.\u201d The New York businessman, who has never held public office, begins his term on Jan. 20. Trump also said he had sold his stocks in June to avoid any conflict-of-interest with the presidency. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for me to be owning stocks when I\u2019m making deals for this country that maybe will affect one company positively and one company negatively,\u201d he said.  His comments followed a series of actions targeting specific companies, including a deal to keep some Carrier jobs in the United States. On Tuesday, he criticized Boeing in a tweet that dented its shares, and he won pledges from two of Asia\u2019s biggest technology companies to expand their U.S. investments. [L1N1E11W9] On Boeing, Trump complained about costs for its revamped Air Force One plane, a prominent symbol of the U.S. presidency, and urged the government to cancel its order. [L1N1E110N] The move was the latest example of Trump\u2019s using his podium, often via Twitter, to rattle companies and foreign countries. Trump told NBC that he and Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg spoke on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work it out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. I\u2019m going to negotiate prices.\u201d He also cautioned U.S. businesses against offshoring jobs. \u201cIf they want to fire their workers, move to Mexico or some other country, and sell their product into our country, they\u2019re going to be paying a tax,\u201d he told NBC. Earlier this month, Trump lauded a deal with United Technologies Corp\u2019s Carrier to keep some U.S. positions in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks following a Thanksgiving Day tweet on the negotiations.    Trump also defended his Twitter posts, telling NBC he used the social media platform to \u201ctalk about important things\u201d and that it conveyed his message \u201cmuch faster than a press release.\u201d     ",

        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Tuesday rejected a plan by U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to back out of a global climate change pact, saying a wise political leader should make policy in line with global trends, a rare comment on a foreign election. The world is moving towards balancing environmental protection and economic growth, China\u2019s top climate change negotiator told reporters, in response to a query on how China would work with a Trump administration on climate change. .   . \u201cIf they resist this trend, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll win the support of their people, and their country\u2019s economic and social progress will also be affected,\u201d Xie Zhenhua said. \u201cI believe a wise political leader should take policy stances that conform with global trends,\u201d China\u2019s veteran climate chief said. Trump has threatened to reject the Paris Agreement, a global accord negotiated by nearly 200 governments to battle climate change that takes effect on Friday. Chinese officials are often hesitant to weigh in on foreign elections, although they will defend Chinese policies when attacked in candidates\u2019 policy platforms. Xie\u2019s comments come as China plans to launch a national carbon trading scheme in 2017. The scheme is on track and pilot programs have already traded 120 million carbon allowances with total transactions amounting to 3.2 billion yuan ($472.29 million), he added. \u201cIt will take time for the market to be fully operational, but once it\u2019s operational, it\u2019ll be the largest carbon trading market in the world,\u201d said Xie. China\u2019s coal consumption has declined as the world\u2019s second-largest economy slows, but Xie said it was too early to decide if it had peaked. China\u2019s delegation of more than 80 negotiators will begin departing from Tuesday for global climate change talks in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh set for Nov. 7 to 18. ",

        "title": "Supreme Court rejects Michigan straight-ticket voting appeal",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected a bid by Michigan to reinstate its Republican-backed ban on straight-ticket voting for the Nov. 8 general election.   The justices left in place a decision by a federal district judge in Michigan who in July suspended a law that abolished straight-ticket voting, the practice of using one mark to vote for all candidates from one party, finding that it would disproportionately affect black voters.  The 6th U.S. Court of Appeals upheld that finding last month, prompting the state to seek a stay from the Supreme Court. Two conservative justices on the eight-member court, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, voted to grant the request, the brief order said.    The Michigan law, passed by a Republican-controlled legislature and signed by a Republican governor, was one of numerous voting measures passed at the state level that put new restrictions on voting. These measures also include stricter voter-identification laws and reduction of early-voting periods before election day. Proponents of the law, enacted in January, have said most states have moved away from a straight-ticket voting option. Removing the option forces voters to study candidates and encourages voters to make decisions based on criteria other than party affiliation, they said. Opponents say voting restrictions are aimed at reducing turnout of minorities, who are more likely to vote for Democrats. U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain in July granted a preliminary injunction sought by civil rights and labor groups who sued Michigan\u2019s Secretary of State Ruth Johnson and Attorney General Bill Schuette. The judge said elimination of straight-ticket voting would be a burden on voting rights and cause long wait times at polls. After Friday\u2019s decision, Schuette said, \u201cIt is my duty to defend Michigan\u2019s laws, in this case a law that stands in 40 other states. Now the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken and I will respect that decision.\u201d The case is one of several voting disputes being litigated ahead of the election and is the second emergency application the Supreme Court has recently been asked to handle. On Aug. 31, the court rejected a bid by North Carolina to reinstate for November\u2019s elections several voting restrictions, including a requirement that people show identification at the polls. The high court is short one justice following the death of conservative Antonin Scalia in February. As a result the court is evenly split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives. ",

        "title": "Supreme Court to hear Minnesota voter apparel law challenge",
        "text": "(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear a conservative group\u2019s free speech challenge to a Minnesota law prohibiting voters from wearing T-shirts or other apparel adorned with overtly political messages inside polling stations.  A group called the Minnesota Voters Alliance is appealing a lower court\u2019s decision to uphold the law, which forbids political badges, buttons or other insignia inside polling places during primary or general elections. State election officials have interpreted the law as also barring campaign literature and material from groups with political views such as the conservative Tea Party movement or the liberal MoveOn.org. Violators are asked to cover up or remove offending items, but officials are instructed not to bar anyone from voting.  The Minnesota Voters Alliance, a St. Paul-based group that says it seeks to expose voter fraud, and several other organizations sued in 2010 claiming state officials turned polling places into \u201cspeech-free zones,\u201d violating the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment protection of freedom of speech.  Other states including Texas, New Jersey and Delaware have regulations similar to Minnesota\u2019s, according to court filings.  The group\u2019s executive director, Andrew Cilek, was temporarily prevented from voting for wearing a T-shirt bearing the Tea Party logo and a button that stated, \u201cPlease I.D. Me.\u201d The button was part of a campaign opposing the state\u2019s lack of a photo identification requirement for voting, court papers said. In rulings in 2013 and 2017, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis upheld the Minnesota restrictions, suggesting the law helps maintain \u201cpeace, order and decorum\u201d at polling sites.  The plaintiffs, represented by the Pacific Legal Foundation conservative legal group, appealed to the Supreme Court saying a total ban on political speech unrelated to candidates or ballot initiatives is overly broad. The high court has allowed states to ban campaign materials and active vote solicitation at polling places, but not all political speech, the plaintiffs said. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision to hear the case is a good sign for First Amendment rights,\u201d foundation lawyer Wen Fa said in an email. A spokesman for Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon declined to comment but state officials said in legal papers the law is neutral with respect to individuals\u2019 viewpoints. It was one of two cases the conservative-majority court took up on Monday in which conservative organizations are seeking to vindicate what they consider to be their free speech rights. The other involved a challenge to a California law regarding private facilities that counsel pregnant women against abortion. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Presidential candidate John Kasich, the governor of Ohio and a former congressman, has positioned himself as a conservative Republican who is nonetheless willing to listen to all sides in order to solve problems. Kasich is challenging outsiders Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is known for antagonizing his party, as an alternative who can win the party\u2019s support in the July convention ahead of the Nov. 8 election. These policies are drawn from his website, statements made at debates and interviews. Kasich has said it is \u201csilly\u201d to think the United States could round up more than 11 million undocumented immigrants and send them back to their home countries.  While he does not support a path to full citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Kasich believes the focus of immigration policies should be keeping families together and creating a path to a legal status for those already in the country who are working and have not committed violent crimes, including establishing a guest worker program.  Kasich does believe this should be underpinned by sealing U.S. borders and has said he would support building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cI\u2019m a free trader,\u201d Kasich said in a January presidential debate, saying he supported both the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  He has supported granting the president authority to fast-track trade deals in the past. He has opposed withdrawing from the World Trade Organization. Kasich\u2019s top priority is a balanced budget and he did a national \u201cbalanced budget tour\u201d last year; his presidential campaign events often have a clock with numbers ticking upward, tracking the level of national debt.  Kasich has pledged to cut taxes for individuals and families and increase the Earned Income Tax Credit, along with eliminating the estate tax. Kasich would also like to lower taxes and create incentives for those who create jobs, including by lowering the top business tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent.  Under Kasich\u2019s tax plan, the highest individual tax rate would be lowered to 28 percent from 39.6 percent. He has said he would launch a \u201ctop-to-bottom review\u201d of the Internal Revenue Service to eliminate inefficiencies.  Kasich wants to increase defense spending by $102 billion. He has called for a no-fly zone over Syria and a \u201ccombat coalition\u201d to fight the Islamic State militant group.  He has said the Syrian refugee crisis is a fundamentally European problem, but the United States should play a role. He believes the United States should \u201cpause\u201d accepting Syrian refugees and that there should be stringent checks. ",

Reuters and other news outlets reported earlier this week that the administration plans to propose to Congress cuts in the budgets for the U.S. State Department and Agency for International Development by about one third. \u201cWe are going to propose to reduce foreign aid and we are going to propose to spend that money here,\u201d White House Office of Management Budget director Mick Mulvaney told Fox News on Saturday, adding the proposed cuts would include \u201cfairly dramatic reductions in foreign aid.\u201d Mulvaney said the cuts in foreign aid would help the administration fund a proposed $54 billion expansion of the U.S. military budget. \u201cThe overriding message is fairly straightforward: less money spent overseas means more money spent here,\u201d said Mulvaney, a former South Carolina Representative. The United States spends just over $50 billion annually on the State Department and USAID, compared with $600 billion or more each year on the Pentagon. Several Republicans this week on Capitol Hill raised concerns about the planned cuts to the State Department. \u201cI am very concerned by reports of deep cuts that could damage efforts to combat terrorism, save lives and create opportunities for American workers,\u201d said U.S. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee.

Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, tweeted earlier this week: \u201cForeign Aid is not charity. We must make sure it is well spent, but it is less than 1% of budget & critical to our national security.\u201d Mulvaney said the Trump administration will release its budget proposal on March 16.

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some 11.9 million Americans watched Thursday\u2019s unusually restrained Republican presidential debate on CNN, the network said on Friday, a sharp drop from the 16.9 million who tuned in last week when the Republican contenders faced off on a much rowdier evening. Thursday\u2019s figure marked the second-smallest audience for a Republican presidential encounter since the 2016 campaign debates began in August 2015, according to Nielsen data.  More people on Thursday tuned in to popular CBS comedy \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d which drew 14.5 million viewers, than watched the debate in Miami, the ratings data showed. The CNN-hosted debate at the University of Miami came just five days before voters in Florida and Ohio will determine whether U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Ohio Governor John Kasich will be able to continue with their increasingly long-shot candidacies for the party\u2019s nomination to run in the Nov. 8 general election. With previous assaults on front-runner Donald Trump having failed to knock him down, Rubio and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas chose a more civil approach on Thursday, raising questions about Trump\u2019s policy positions without attacking him personally. Trump\u2019s presence has boosted TV audiences for presidential debates, helping to attract a record 24 million viewers for his first official outing as a candidate in August last year.  Since then, however, audiences have dropped off, with only the raucous March 3 Republican encounter coming close to the interest seen last year. Democratic TV debates have fared less well with the public and have struggled to attract audiences of more than 10 million since January.

        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen has given the United Nations permission to resume flights of aid workers to the Houthi-controlled capital on Saturday, but not to dock ships loaded with wheat and medical supplies, a U.N. spokesman said. The coalition fighting the armed Houthi movement in Yemen said on Wednesday it would allow aid in through the Red Sea ports of Hodeidah and Salif, as well as U.N. flights to Sanaa, more than two weeks after blockading the country.  About 7 million people face famine in Yemen and their survival is dependent on international assistance. The coalition has given clearance for U.N. flights in and out of Sanaa from Amman on Saturday, involving the regular rotation of aid workers, said Jens Laerke, spokesman of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).   We re of course encouraged by the clearance of this flight which may be followed soon by clearances of flights from Djibouti to Sanaa,  Laerke told a news briefing on Friday. But no green light have been received for U.N. requests to bring humanitarian supply ships to Hodeidah and Salif ports, he said.  We are particularly talking about one ship which is offshore Hodeidah with wheat from WFP (the U.N. World Food Programme) and another boat which is waiting in Djibouti with cholera supplies and that is also destined for Hodeidah,  he said.  We stress the critical importance of resuming also commercial imports, in particular fuel supplies for our humanitarian response - transportation and so on - and for water pumping, Laerke said. The largest fuel importing companies in Yemen have indicated they will no longer be able to supply the consumer market at the end of this week, OCHA said in a report dated Nov. 23. UNICEF is also waiting to send vaccines, aid sources said. The charity Save the Children said an estimated 20,000 Yemeni children under the age of five were joining the ranks of the severely malnourished every month,  an average of 27 children every hour . The commercial blockade is aggravating the food crisis,  leading to a significant increase in child deaths from acute malnutrition and preventable diseases , it said in a statement. The U.S.-backed coalition closed air, land and sea access on Nov. 6, in a move it said was to stop the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran. The action came after Saudi Arabia intercepted a missile fired toward Riyadh. Iran has denied supplying weapons. Jan Egeland, a former U.N. aid chief who heads the Norwegian Refugee Council, speaking to Reuters in Geneva on Thursday, said of the blockade:  In my view this is illegal collective punishment.   After more than two weeks of blockade of these ports, there are various kinds of supplies essential for fighting famine, for fighting cholera and other types of humanitarian threats that millions of people are facing in Yemen today,  Laerke said.

        "title": "China jails former Tianjin mayor for 12 years over graft",
        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday jailed former Tianjin mayor Huang Xingguo for 12 years, after he took more than 40 million yuan ($6 million) in bribes to push through promotions and land approvals, a court in the northern province of Hebei said. Dozens of senior Chinese officials have been investigated or jailed since President Xi Jinping assumed power, vowing to root out corruption and warning that the problem threatens the ruling Communist Party s grip on power. Huang, who was also acting chief of the Communist Party in the northern port city, became its mayor in 2008, before being investigated on suspicion of corruption in September last year. He abused his power to obtain bribes of more than 40 million yuan ($6.04 million) in exchange for promotions and land approvals, the Shijiazhuang Intermediate People s Court said on its official microblog on China s Twitter-like Weibo.     The corrupt behavior spanned Huang s political career of more than two decades spent in several Chinese cities, from previous posts in Ningbo and Taizhou in the coastal province of Zhejiang to his time in Tianjin, the statement added.  It was not possible for Reuters to reach Huang for comment.  In January, the Communist Party said it would prosecute Huang, 63, for graft, following its announcement last September of an initial investigation. Huang had made  presumptuous comments  on government policy and had damaged party unity, the investigation by the corruption watchdog, the Central Commission for Disciplinary Inspection (CCDI), showed.    He was also found to have accepted gifts, traveled with an  entourage  and worked to further his career by buying support and giving jobs to friends. The court said its sentence took into account the guilt and remorse Huang expressed over his offences, besides his cooperative attitude and the evidence he gave investigators. Tianjin, about an hour southeast of Beijing, has ambitions to become a financial hub for northern China and is one of four  areas designated a municipality, along with Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, giving it the same high status as a province. In 2015, a series of massive explosions at a chemicals warehouse in Tianjin killed about 170 people, provoking nationwide anger that it had been built close to people s homes.  ",

        "title": "Details emerge of Republicans' plans to replace Obamacare",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Details of potential Obamacare replacements by U.S. House Republicans emerged in news reports on Friday, as Republican lawmakers have vowed to introduce new legislation in the coming weeks. Republicans have yet to agree on a single detailed policy proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the signature domestic policy of former Democratic President Barack Obama.  Still to be worked out are details including the future of Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor that was expanded in more than 30 states under Obamacare, and how a new healthcare law would be funded.  One emerging scenario among Republicans is that the millions of people who received health coverage through the expansion of Medicaid would be \u201cgrandfathered in,\u201d according to the Washington Post. States that did not expand Medicaid could receive more money through increased federal \u201cdisproportionate share\u201d payments used to help hospitals that serve a large number of uninsured patients.  And a draft Republican replacement plan for Obamacare, which news outlet Politico uploaded to its website, would cap the amount of money given to states for Medicaid and end tax subsidies based on income for the purchase of individual plans in 2020.  House staffers would not comment on the authenticity of the document, which was dated Feb. 10. President Donald Trump and Republicans have said they would present a plan for repealing and replacing Obamacare in the coming weeks.   It is not clear whether there is sufficiently broad support among Republican lawmakers for all of the measures in the draft proposal, or how the plans might change as they move through congressional committees.  The draft \u201caddresses the major issues and is a serious proposal for transitioning out of Obamacare,\u201d said Ed Haislmaier, a senior research fellow and healthcare policy expert at the Heritage Foundation who was on Trump\u2019s transition team.  \u201cClearly the details will continue to evolve and we\u2019ll be watching as they do,\u201d he said in an emailed statement to Reuters. U.S. health insurance executives, many of whom have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on the Obamacare individual insurance markets, are due to meet with Trump on Monday, according to a Bloomberg report. A Blue Cross Blue Shield Association spokeswoman confirmed it was invited to the meeting and will attend. Republicans have repeatedly pledged not to \u201cpull the rug out\u201d from millions of Americans who gained access to healthcare under the law, and recent polls show more respondents favoring Obamacare than opposing it.  The Kaiser Family Foundation found broad bipartisan support for maintaining federal funding for the Medicaid expansion, with 84 percent of respondents saying it was important to do so, according to a survey released on Friday. The poll also found the law has record levels of support, with more Americans now viewing it favorably than unfavorably.  \u201cObamacare has failed. We welcome any and all efforts to repeal and replace it that put patients first,\u201d said Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Democrats decried the draft proposal on Friday and said it would cause millions of Americans to lose their health insurance.  \u201cThe deeply harmful path House Republicans have laid out would spell disaster for families nationwide,\u201d U.S. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump, who promised families he would provide insurance for everyone, should be the first to oppose it.\u201d ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will vote as soon as Wednesday on a joint resolution seeking to block a $1.15 billion sale of military equipment to Saudi Arabia over concerns about the conflict in Yemen, sponsors of the measure said on Monday. Republican Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee and Democratic Senators Chris Murphy and Al Franken introduced the legislation on Sept. 8. Backers of the joint resolution say it would block the sale of Abrams tanks and other equipment if it were passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives and signed by President Barack Obama. However, any effort to stop the sale would face stiff opposition from the White House, which has already approved the sale, as well as in Congress. The measure\u2019s backers said that, even if it does not pass, a positive vote or a strong vote would send a strong message about continued U.S. support for Saudi Arabia. Paul and Murphy told a meeting at the Center for the National Interest in Washington on Monday that they have deep concern about the Saudi conflict in Yemen, and think the United States should rethink its automatic support for the Riyadh government. \u201cI think holding back the arms may give them a chance to show that they can do better,\u201d Paul said. Murphy said supporting Saudi action in Yemen hurts U.S. security. \u201cIf we are helping to radicalize Yemenis against us, we are participating in the slaughter of civilians, and we are allowing extremist groups that have plans and plots against the United States to grow stronger, how can that be in our security interest?\u201d Murphy asked.

        "title": "Exclusive: Trump could seek new law to purge government of Obama appointees",
        "text": "CLEVELAND (Reuters) - If he wins the presidency, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would seek to purge the federal government of officials appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama and could ask Congress to pass legislation making it easier to fire public workers, Trump ally, Chris Christie, said on Tuesday. Christie, who is governor of New Jersey and leads Trump\u2019s White House transition team, said the campaign was drawing up a list of federal government employees to fire if Trump defeats Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election.  \u201cAs you know from his other career, Donald likes to fire people,\u201d Christie told a closed-door meeting with dozens of  donors at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters and two participants in the meeting. Christie was referring to Trump\u2019s starring role in the long-running television show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d where his catch-phrase was \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Trump\u2019s transition advisers fear that Obama may convert these appointees to civil servants, who have more job security than officials who have been politically appointed. This would allow officials to keep their jobs in a new, possibly Republican, administration, Christie said. \u201cIt\u2019s called burrowing,\u201d Christie said. \u201cYou take them from the political appointee side into the civil service side, in order to try to set up ... roadblocks for your successor, kind of like when all the Clinton people took all the Ws off the keyboard when George Bush was coming into the White House.\u201d Christie was referring to pranks committed during the presidential transition from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush in 2001. During that period, some White House staffers removed the W key on computer keyboards and left derogatory signs and stickers in offices, according to a report by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress. \u201cOne of the things I have suggested to Donald is that we have to immediately ask the Republican Congress to change the civil service laws. Because if they do, it will make it a lot easier to fire those people,\u201d Christie said. He said firing civil servants was \u201ccumbersome\u201d and \u201ctime-consuming.\u201d Christie also said that changing the leadership of the Environmental Protection Agency, long a target of Republicans concerned about over regulation, would be a top priority for Trump should he win in November. Trump has previously vowed to eliminate the EPA and roll back some of America\u2019s most ambitious environmental policies, actions that he says would revive the U.S. oil and coal industries and bolster national security. Christie added that the Trump team wants to let businesspeople serve in government part time without having to give up their jobs in the private sector. Trump frequently says he is better equipped to be president because of his business experience. Although Christie was repeatedly asked during the meeting, he declined to name any potential Cabinet picks. He said Trump was not ready to do that yet. Responding to Christie\u2019s comments on targeting political appointees on Wednesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that allowing appointees to apply for career civil service positions was \u201ca longstanding precedent.\u201d  \u201cIf you want to stack up the ethical record of President Obama and his political appointees against the ethical record compiled by Governor Christie and his political appointees, that we\u2019d welcome that kind of comparison,\u201d he said. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union in the United States, said while it was concerned about the practice of \u201cburrowing,\u201d current law protected most federal employees from at will firing. \u201cThe federal government is a serious undertaking. It\u2019s not a reality TV show, with \u2018You\u2019re fired!\u2019\u201d said Jacqueline Simon, policy director at AFGE. \u201cJust as we don\u2019t want to hire anybody for political reasons, we don\u2019t want anybody to be fired for political reasons,\u201d she said. As of March 2016, there were a total of 3,164 political appointees, 852 of whom were presidential appointees.  In its most recent report on the topic, the Government Accountability Office said in 2010 that 143 former political appointees and congressional employees converted to career positions between May 1, 2005, and May 30, 2009.  The Republican-controlled House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee is investigating the practice of burrowing. It sent letters dated Wednesday to 23 federal departments and agencies, asking them to document all cases of burrowing that have occurred since Sept. 1, 2015. ",

        "text": "BEIJING/HANOI (Reuters) - China urged Vietnam on Friday to take a calm and rational view of its military drills in the South China Sea, after Vietnam expressed opposition, as tension between the neighbors worsens over the disputed strategic waterway. China has appeared uneasy at Vietnam s efforts to rally Southeast Asian countries over the busy waterway as well as at its neighbor s growing defense ties with the United States, Japan and India. In July, under pressure from Beijing, Vietnam suspended oil drilling in offshore waters that are also claimed by China. Vietnam was deeply concerned about the exercises in the Gulf of Tonkin area, at the north end of the South China Sea, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said in a statement, but did not make clear what drills were being referred to.  Vietnam proposes China to cease and refrain from repeating acts that complicate the situation in the East Sea,  Hang said, employing Vietnam s name for the South China Sea. All foreign activities in Vietnamese waters must comply with Vietnamese and international laws, she added. Vietnam s Foreign Ministry conveyed its position to a Chinese embassy representative on Thursday, the statement added, without saying when China s announcement was made or when any drill might take place. In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the drills were routine annual exercises and were being carried out in the northwestern part of the South China Sea.  The relevant sea is under China s jurisdiction,  she told a daily news briefing on Friday, adding that China had the right to carry out such drills in the waters there.  We hope the relevant side can calmly and rationally view it,  she added. Last month, the Maritime Safety Administration of China s southern province of Hainan, which oversees the South China Sea, said military drills would take place south of the province and east of Vietnam from Aug. 29 until Sept. 4. There would be live fire drills around the Paracel Islands, which Vietnam claims, until Sunday, it added. China claims nearly all the South China Sea, through which an estimated $3 trillion in international trade passes each year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan also have claims. ",

        "text": "VIENNA (Reuters) - An international nuclear test-ban body that runs a global network of listening posts designed to check for secret atomic blasts detected an  unusual signal  underwater last week near where an Argentine submarine went missing, it said on Thursday.  The Vienna-based Comprehensive nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) runs monitoring stations equipped with devices including hydrophones - underwater microphones that scan the oceans for sound waves. Two of its monitoring stations detected the unusual signal, the CTBTO said in a statement, adding that it was passing the information on to the Argentine authorities coordinating the search for the ARA San Juan, which had 44 crew on board when it went missing last week. An Argentine navy spokesman said earlier on Thursday that an abnormal sound detected near the submarine s last known position in the South Atlantic was  consistent with an explosion , but the CTBTO was more guarded on the possible cause.   It could be consistent with an explosion but there is no certainty about this,  CTBTO hydroacoustic engineer Mario Zampolli told Reuters. He agreed with the navy spokesman s description of the signal as unusual and short, adding that the cause was non-natural.  We can also calculate the time when the event happened in that location and that time is about three and a half hours after the last contact that the sub apparently had, according to what s out in the news,  he said.

        "title": "Kim Jong Un praises nuclear program, promotes sister",
        "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea s leader Kim Jong Un said his nuclear weapons were a  powerful deterrent  that guaranteed its sovereignty, state media reported on Sunday, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said  only one thing will work  in dealing with the isolated country. Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind.  In a speech to a meeting of the powerful Central Committee of the ruling Workers  Party on Saturday, a day before Trump s most recent comments, state media said Kim had addressed the  complicated international situation . North Korea s nuclear weapons are a  powerful deterrent firmly safeguarding the peace and security in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia,  Kim said, referring to the  protracted nuclear threats of the U.S. imperialists.  In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. North Korea is preparing to test-launch such a missile, a Russian lawmaker who had just returned from a visit to Pyongyang was quoted as saying on Friday. Donald Trump has previously said the United States would  totally destroy  North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies. The situation proved that North Korea s policy of  byungjin , meaning the parallel development of nuclear weapons and the economy was  absolutely right , Kim Jong Un said in the speech.  The national economy has grown on their strength this year, despite the escalating sanctions,  said Kim, referring to U.N. Security Council resolutions put in place to curb Pyongyang s nuclear and missile program.  The meeting also handled some personnel changes inside North Korea s secretive and opaque ruling center of power, state media said. Kim Jong Un s sister, Kim Yo Jong, was made an alternate member of the politburo - the top decision-making body over which Kim Jong Un presides. Alongside Kim Jong Un himself, the promotion makes Kim Yo Jong the only other millennial member of the influential body. Her new position indicates the 28-year-old has become a replacement for Kim Jong Un s aunt, Kim Kyong Hui, who had been a key decision maker when former leader Kim Jong Il was alive.  It shows that her portfolio and writ is far more substantive than previously believed and it is a further consolidation of the Kim family s power,  said Michael Madden, a North Korea expert at Johns Hopkins University s 38 North website. In January, the U.S. Treasury blacklisted Kim Yo Jong along with other North Korean officials over  severe human rights abuses . Kim Jong Sik and Ri Pyong Chol, two of the three men behind Kim s banned rocket program, were also promoted. State media announced that several other high ranking cadres were promoted to the Central Committee in what the South Korean unification ministry said could be an attempt by North Korea to navigate a way through its increasing isolation.  The large-scale personnel reshuffle reflects that Kim Jong Un is taking the current situation seriously, and that he s looking for a breakthrough by promoting a new generation of politicians,  the ministry said in a statement. North Korea s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, who named Donald Trump  President Evil  in a bombastic speech to the U.N. General Assembly last month, was promoted to full vote-carrying member of the politburo.  Ri can now be safely identified as one of North Korea s top policy makers,  said Madden.  Even if he has informal or off the record meetings, Ri s interlocutors can be assured that whatever proposals they proffer will be taken directly to the top,  he said.  ",

        "title": "Trump names temporary chairs for U.S. labor agencies",
        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has appointed Republican members of two federal labor agencies to serve as their acting chairs, an early signal of a shift to more business-friendly policies. The National Labor Relations Board on Thursday said Trump had named Philip Miscimarra to the temporary role, one day after the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced that Victoria Lipnic had been named acting chair of the commission. The NLRB oversees union elections and enforces a federal law protecting workers\u2019 rights to organize. The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Under former President Barack Obama, both agencies were the target of fierce criticism from business groups and Republican officials.  Miscimarra and Lipnic, both Obama appointees, will temporarily replace Democrats who had chaired the agencies until Trump\u2019s permanent replacements are confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The EEOC and NLRB chairs make staffing decisions and have a key role in updating guidelines and setting agency priorities. The EEOC currently has one vacancy, and the NLRB has two. Despite being Obama appointees, Lipnic and Miscimarra have routinely broken with their Democratic colleagues.  Miscimarra\u2019s many dissents in NLRB cases since his appointment in 2013 helped lay the foundation for claims by the business community that under Obama, the board baldly favored unions rather than promoting a balance between labor and management. In 2012, Lipnic dissented in a landmark EEOC case in which the commission ruled for the first time that discrimination against gay workers is a form of unlawful sex bias. She also objected to guidelines on pregnancy discrimination released by the commission in 2014, and regulations published the following year that made it easier for workers to sue for age discrimination. Lipnic, who worked at the U.S. Department of Labor under President George W. Bush before joining the EEOC in 2010, said in a statement that she was honored by the appointment. \u201cI believe equal employment opportunity is critical to all Americans and to how we define ourselves as a nation,\u201d she said. Miscimarra in a separate statement said his goal was \u201cto foster stability and to apply the National Labor Relations Act in an even-handed manner that serves the interests of employees, employers and unions throughout the country.\u201d ",

        "text": "OSLO (Reuters) - A former senior Norwegian police officer was sentenced to 21 years in prison on Monday for aiding drug smugglers and taking bribes in a case that captivated a nation accustomed to clean law enforcement. Eirik Jensen, 60, now retired, was once in charge of combating Oslo s criminal gangs. He had denied the accusations against him and his lawyer said he would appeal. Prosecutors accused Jensen of aiding a smuggling ring for more than a decade by providing information on police and customs staffing, much of it via hundreds of cryptic mobile phone text messages, in return for illegal payments. Jensen s co-defendant Gjermund Cappelen, who admitted organizing the imports of tonnes of hashish, was the prosecution s key witness and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.  This case is unique in Norwegian legal history,  Oslo District Court Judge Kim Heger said as he read the unanimous verdict against the police officer.  Jensen has actively and deliberately contributed to a well-organized and extensive import of hashish,  he said. Jensen and his lawyers argued during the trial that the evidence of contact with criminals was merely a result of normal police work intended to extract information and that he had not received any money or gifts.  We lost the battle, but we hope to win the war,  Jensen s attorney John Christian Elden told reporters after the verdict was made public.  There will be an appeal.  Such cases are rare in Norway, ranked the world s sixth-least corrupt country by watchdog Transparency International, and this case generated vast media coverage, including an unusual live television broadcast of parts of the trial. In neighboring Finland, also among the least corrupt nations, the former head of Helsinki s drug squad was sentenced last year to 10 years in prison for drug smuggling, official misconduct and other crimes, including tampering with evidence. That case is the subject of an appeal. ",

Following is the text of his resignation letter, which was released by the White House. In the course of my duties as the incoming National Security Advisor, I held numerous phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers, and ambassadors. These calls were to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships between the President, his advisors and foreign leaders. Such calls are standard practice in any transition of this magnitude. Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology. Throughout my over thirty three years of honorable military service, and my tenure as the National Security Advisor, I have always performed my duties with the utmost of integrity and honesty to those I have served, to include the President of the United States. I am tendering my resignation, honored to have served our nation and the American people in such a distinguished way. I am also extremely honored to have served President Trump, who in just three weeks, has reoriented American foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore America\u2019s leadership position in the world. As I step away once again from serving my nation in this current capacity, I wish to thank President Trump for his personal loyalty, the friendship of those who I worked with throughout the hard fought campaign, the challenging period of transition, and during the early days of his presidency. I know with the strong leadership of President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and the superb team they are assembling, this team will go down in history as one of the greatest presidencies in U.S. history, and I firmly believe the American people will be well served as they all work together to help Make America Great Again.

        "text": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland might consider adding elements to the text of an agreement on the post-Brexit future of Northern Ireland s border as long as they do not undermine those already contained in the deal, the Irish Times reported on Tuesday.  British Prime Minister Theresa May has found it difficult to come up with a formula that satisfies both EU member Ireland, which wants to avoid creation of a  hard  border, and Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which says the British province must quit the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK. The DUP props up May s minority government. A tentative deal on the border, promising  regulatory alignment  on both sides of the island of Ireland, was agreed on Monday. It was later rejected by the DUP, which says it cannot allow any divergence in regulation between Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK. Brussels says agreement is needed before it will give the green light for Britain to begin talks on future free trade when European Union leaders meet next week. The Irish Times quoted a spokesman for Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar as saying the adding of elements to assuage the concerns of the DUP  doesn t seem unreasonable  and was  a possibility.  The Irish Times suggested such an element might refer to the strength of the UK as a political entity.  Asked to comment on the report, a spokesman for Varadkar said  the view of the Irish government is that the terms of the deal reached on Monday must stand.   It s up to the UK government to work out with the DUP how it proposes to move forward,  the spokesman added.  ",

        "title": "Factbox: Trump fills top jobs for his administration",
        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday he would name retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The following is a list of Republican Trump\u2019s selections for top jobs in his administration. All the posts but that of national security adviser require Senate confirmation: Mattis is a retired Marine Corps general known for his tough talk, distrust of Iran and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. A former leader of Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, Mattis, 66, is known by many U.S. forces by his nickname \u201cMad Dog.\u201d He was once rebuked for saying in 2005: \u201cIt\u2019s fun to shoot some people.\u201d Mnuchin, 53, is a relatively little-known but successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002. He assembled an investor group to buy a failed California mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as OneWest Bank and built it into Southern California\u2019s largest bank. The bank came under fire for its foreclosure practices as housing advocacy groups accused it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Ross, 78, heads the private equity firm W.L. Ross & Co. His net worth was pegged by Forbes at about $2.9 billion. A staunch supporter of Trump and an economic adviser, Ross has helped shape the Trump campaign\u2019s views on trade policy. He blames the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which entered into force in 1994, and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization for causing massive U.S. factory job losses. Chao, 63, was labor secretary under President George W. Bush for eight years and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. Chao is a director at Ingersoll Rand, News Corp and Vulcan Materials Company. She is married to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: U.S. REPRESENTATIVE TOM PRICE Price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House of Representatives\u2019 Budget Committee. A representative from Georgia since 2005, Price has criticized Obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. He is opposed to abortion. U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY Haley, a 44-year-old Republican, has been governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. The daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman. DeVos, 58, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for the expansion of charter schools.  Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump\u2019s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. The son of a country-store owner, the senator from Alabama and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  Carson, 65, is a retired neurosurgeon who dropped out of the Republican presidential nominating race in March and threw his support to Trump. A popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, Carson previously indicated reluctance to take a position in the incoming administration because of his lack of experience in the federal government. Carson is the first African-American picked for a Cabinet spot by Trump. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN Flynn, 57, was an early supporter of Trump and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his U.S. Army career in 1981 and served deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under President Barack Obama, but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obama\u2019s foreign policy. Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. government\u2019s sweeping collection of Americans\u2019 communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two months after signing it, President Donald Trump has not begun enforcing a law imposing new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea, Senators John McCain and Ben Cardin said in a letter seen by Reuters on Friday. Also, with just two days to go, his administration has not provided information related to Russia\u2019s defense and intelligence sectors required under the measure by Sunday, they said. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment on the letter from McCain, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. Later on Friday, the White House issued a presidential memorandum taking the first step toward implementation by designating different agencies to start the process putting the law into effect. Trump grudgingly signed the \u201cCountering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act\u201d on Aug. 2 after Congress overwhelmingly approved the measure despite Trump\u2019s reservations about how it might affect his desire for improved relations with Moscow. The White House had hedged for weeks, as the legislation worked its way through Congress, over whether the president would sign it or use his veto power. Although his fellow Republicans control Congress, it passed both the Senate and House of Representatives by near-unanimous margins large enough to override a veto. Trump\u2019s opposition to the law had raised questions about how enthusiastically his administration would enforce it. \u201cCongress\u2019 swift and united action, and your signature, sent a strong message to our allies and adversaries alike, and particularly to those such as Russia, who have sought to undermine our democracy,\u201d said the letter, dated Thursday. \u201cNow, as critical deadlines are approaching, it is imperative that your Administration implement the law to its fullest extent to uphold and protect American interests,\u201d it said. The law imposed stiff new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea over issues including Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election, which Russia denies, as well as Iran\u2019s ballistic missiles program and North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons development. The administration in particular opposed a provision that would not let Trump, or any president, ease or lift sanctions on Russia without Congress\u2019 approval. The letter also noted the Oct. 1 deadline for the administration to issue \u201cregulations or other guidance\u201d to identify anyone who is operating on behalf of the Russian defense and intelligence sectors for potential sanctions.

        "title": "Austrian coalition talks set to begin, far right likely partner",
        "text": "VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s president gave the green light to conservative leader Sebastian Kurz on Friday to form a government, but Kurz gave little away about his coalition plans, leaving a tie-up with the far right the most likely outcome. Kurz s People s Party (OVP) secured 31.5 percent of the vote in Sunday s parliamentary election, winning by a clear margin but falling well short of the majority needed to control parliament in the affluent Alpine republic.  I would like to build a government that has the courage and determination to bring real change to Austria,  Kurz, 31, told reporters after meeting President Alexander Van der Bellen, who will oversee the process. Kurz campaigned on a platform that combined a hard line on immigration similar to that of the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) with traditional conservative principles like slimming down the state and cutting taxes. He said he would start by holding talks with all parties in parliament although only two of them, the Social Democrats (SPO) and FPO, have enough seats to give him a majority if they go into coalition with the OVP.  I will now get straight to work and hold the first discussions, definitely in the coming days, and possibly even today,  Kurz said, adding that after those initial discussions he might launch formal coalition talks with one party. Kurz went to Brussels on Thursday to assure European Union leaders of his support, allaying concerns that Austria country would become a dissonant voice in the EU with the anti-immigrant far right likely to enter its government. It became clear after neighboring Germany s election last month that it was headed towards a three-way  Jamaica  coalition - so called because the parties  colors match that country s flag. Austria s political future could be colorful too.  Using the same principle and some creative licence, Austria s next government could be dubbed  Botswana  or  Islamic State . Two other options,  Haiti  and  Albania , appear to be off the table, at least for the time being. In Austria as in Germany, each party is traditionally associated with a color - black for Kurz s OVP, red for the centre-left SPO and blue for the far-right FPO.  Botswana (black and blue) remains the most likely option, given that Kurz and the head of the Social Democrats, outgoing Chancellor Christian Kern, have often clashed and Kurz called an end to their coalition, forcing Sunday s snap election. Kurz has said he would prefer to form a stable coalition but not ruled out a minority, monochrome government (Islamic State). He has accused his rivals of holding talks on an SPO-FPO,  red-blue  coalition (Haiti). But FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache poured cold water on the idea of a  coalition of losers  in an interview with tabloid Oesterreich. Asked if Kern had been voted out as chancellor, Strache said:  In my opinion, yes.  He added that people had voted for change and Kurz had a mandate to try and form a government.   If he were to invite us (to hold coalition talks), we would accept the invitation,  he said, adding that in such a case the FPO would not hold parallel talks with the SPO. Strache hosted Kurz at his home for dinner this week, their first one-on-one meeting, he said.      The chances of a red-blue alliance are  a thousandth of a thousandth , Kern told reporters at an EU summit in Brussels, but he added that his party was still open to talks. A black-red coalition (Albania) has not been completely ruled out. Kurz has hinted at being prepared to consider it if Kern is replaced as leader by Defense Minister Hans Peter Doskozil. Strache also focused his criticism on Kern rather than the SPO as a whole. ",

        "title": "China says it has right to bar people from Hong Kong after British activist expelled",
        "text": "HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Thursday it had the right to bar people from Hong Kong, a day after a British activist was denied entry to the former British colony, and that it had complained to Britain after it demanded an explanation. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a  one country, two systems  formula that promises it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland. But critics have accused the government of bending to the will of Communist Party leaders in Beijing and of a gradual watering down of the territory s freedoms, including freedom of speech and right to protest. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was  very concerned  that Benedict Rogers, a co-founder of the Conservative Party s Human Rights Commission, was denied entry to Hong Kong on Wednesday and demanded an  urgent explanation  from Hong Kong and China. It came a week before a sensitive Communist Party leadership meeting starts in Beijing. Johnson also said Hong Kong s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms were  central to its way of life . Rogers has been a vocal critic of China-ruled Hong Kong s treatment of political activists, including that of jailed student leader Joshua Wong. He believes the decision to bar him was made by Chinese officials after the Chinese Embassy in London had warned him earlier, through a British member of parliament, that he wouldn t be allowed in. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the central government had a responsibility for foreign matters related to Hong Kong.  The central Chinese government and the special administrative region government handle the relevant issue in accordance with the law,  Hua said.  Allowing or not allowing people in is China s sovereignty ... Hong Kong affairs are a purely internal matter for China.  She said China had lodged a solemn representation with Britain, meaning an official complaint. When asked about the incident on a radio talk show, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam agreed.   Ultimately, under the Basic Law (Hong Kong s mini-constitution), the central government is responsible for foreign affairs,  Lam said.  Asked if immigration controls fell under Hong Kong jurisdiction, Lam said:  It has to be considered whether foreign affairs are involved during the process of immigration.  If you say everything falls under Hong Kong s high degree of autonomy, this is not what the Basic Law says.  Rogers, speaking to Reuters shortly after arriving in London, said Beijing s statement confirmed his assumption that the decision to boot him out was made not by Hong Kong but by Chinese authorities. He described the interference in Hong Kong s immigration controls as  very alarming  and  a very serious threat to  one country, two systems .   China has now revealed its hand. The world ought to have woken up a long time ago, but I think now they really ought to wake up to what this means for  one country, two systems ,  he said.  I m very sad for what this means for Hong Kong.  The former head of Hong Kong s civil service turned pro-democracy activist, Anson Chan, said the case was a  serious breach  of the Basic Law. Article 154 of the Basic Law says Hong Kong  may apply immigration controls on entry  of foreigners into Hong Kong.  The Immigration Department must have sought instructions from on high,  she told Reuters.  They (Beijing) are sending a message that if you dare speak out on Hong Kong ... you will not be allowed in.  Amnesty International s East Asia director, Nicholas Bequelin, suggested China s definition of what constitutes national security is creeping into Hong Kong.   In China if you re critical of the political system, you re committing a national security crime and this is exactly the type of thing  one country, two systems  should protect against.  In response to a Reuters  request for comment on whether China was involved in Rogers  denial of entry, Hong Kong s Immigration Department said it did not comment on individual cases. China has admitted asking a group of British MPs to cancel a visit to Hong Kong in 2014 during the massive pro-democracy protests, of which Joshua Wong was a leader, that paralyzed highways for 79 days. Hong Kong has, on occasion, barred entry to individuals including dissidents, such as former leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing and a Danish sculptor, Jens Galschiot, who made a Tiananmen sculpture.

        "text": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian police have pledged to bar Islamist groups from staging a rally on Friday at the Borobudur Buddhist temple in central Java to protest against the persecution of Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims. Islamist groups say they plan the demonstration close to the stupa-topped Borobudur temple, which dates from the 9th century and is a popular tourist site, to call for an end to violence against the religious and ethnic minority in Myanmar.  Indonesia has the world s largest population of Muslims and there have been a number of anti-Myanmar protests in Jakarta and the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur over the treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Rohingyas.  Almost 125,000 Rohingyas have been forced to flee clashes between Rohingya insurgents and the army in the northwest Rakhine state. Tens of thousands have crossed the border into neighboring Bangladesh.  The action at Borobudur temple will be prohibited,  National Police Chief Tito Karnavian told reporters, according to media.   This is not just part of the heritage of Indonesia, but that of the world. There is no need for protests in response to the Rohingya conflict because the Indonesian government is taking action on it already.  Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi on Monday met  Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and top security officials to call for a halt to the bloodshed. Marsudi was due in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, on Tuesday. Pakistani Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif expressed  deep anguish at the ongoing violence against the Rohingya Muslims  and urged the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to take  immediate and effective action to bring an end to all human-rights violations against innocent and unarmed Rohingya Muslim population . An organizer of Friday s planned protest said the groups wanted to protest peacefully near the Borobodur temple to show Indonesia s tolerance.  The Borobudur is an extraordinary symbol of tolerance,  said Anang Imamuddin.  We want the world to know that it is in a majority Muslim country but it is safe. Buddhist monks are safe here too.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation that would grant U.S. privacy rights to Europeans is being delayed in the U.S. Senate, which may complicate negotiations over a broader trans-Atlantic data transfer pact that faces a January deadline for completion, sources said on Wednesday. The Judicial Redress Act, which would allow citizens of European allied countries to sue over data privacy in the United States, is \u201clikely to be held\u201d from a scheduled vote on Thursday in the Senate Judiciary Committee, a panel aide said.  Passage of the legislation is viewed as an important step toward securing a new \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d framework after the previous one was struck down by a top European Union court last year amid concerns about U.S. surveillance. More than 4,000 firms, including tech behemoths such as Google and IBM, have been relying on the 15-year-old Safe Harbor framework to freely transfer data between the United States and Europe, which has far stricter rules on the privacy of personal information. But that deal was ruled invalid last October by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which cited revelations about U.S. mass surveillance by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. European Union data protection authorities have given Brussels and Washington until the end of January to strike a new Safe Harbor agreement for transferring personal data.  Industry executives are growing increasingly alarmed that the new Safe Harbor agreement will not be completed in time. The Information Technology Industry Council, a Washington-based trade organization that represents Apple, Microsoft and other major tech companies, sent some of its executives to Europe on Wednesday to press for a quick resolution. A spokesman for the organization, which warned of \u201cenormous\u201d consequences in a letter this week to President Barack Obama and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker if a pact is not forged soon, said its leaders are meeting with government and data protection authorities in several cities, including Dublin, Amsterdam, Berlin and London, ahead of the deadline. EU privacy regulators are due to meet on Feb. 2 to decide if they should begin enforcement action against companies if they determine all transfer mechanisms violate EU law and there is no new framework in place.

        "text": "TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The Organization of American States (OAS) said late on Sunday that Honduras should hold new presidential elections, after the electoral tribunal declared conservative President Juan Orlando Hernandez the official winner of the bitterly contested Nov. 26 presidential vote. The tribunal said that Hernandez beat center-left challenger and TV star Salvador Nasralla by 1.53 percentage points, according to the official count, sparking fraud accusations and calls for renewed street protests. In a nationally televised address, tribunal head David Matamoros said all the challenges presented to it had been resolved and votes were recounted at select polling stations, declaring Hernandez  the president-elect for the Republic of Honduras.  OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro questioned the tribunal s decision.  The people of Honduras deserve an electoral process that confers them democratic quality and guarantees. The electoral process that the tribunal concluded today clearly did not provide that,  Almagro said in a statement. He said the election was marred by irregularities and deficiencies and called for a new general election. In a video posted on Facebook, Nasralla said it was clear there had been fraud  before, during and after  the election, calling the tribunal s decision a  desperate move.  The candidate said he was headed to Washington to meet with Almagro, as well as officials of the U.S. State Department. The outcome of those meetings would help determine what steps to take next, he added. The OAS electoral observer mission said late on Sunday it could not confirm that the election had been  intentionally manipulated  but added that the process had been riddled with issues. Honduras has been roiled by political instability and violent protests since the vote, which initial counts suggested Nasralla had won. The count has been questioned by the two main opposition parties, including the Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship, headed by Nasralla, as well as a wide swath of the diplomatic corps. However, European Union election observers said the vote recount showed no irregularities.  After comparing a large random sample of voting records provided to us by the Alliance and the original records published on the tribunal s website, the mission observed that the results presented practically no differences,  said Jose Antonio de Gabriel, the adjunct head of the EU s mission. Former Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, who backed Nasralla, took to Twitter, saying Hernandez  is not our president  and urging people to take to the streets in protest. TV broadcast images of protesters setting up flaming barricades and blocking roads in cities around the country. The tribunal had initially declared Nasralla the leader in an announcement on the morning after the vote, with just over half of the ballot boxes counted. It then gave no further updates for about 36 hours. Once results started flowing in again, Nasralla s lead began narrowing and eventually disappeared. That prompted national protests, in which 22 people were killed, including two police officers, according to a tally by the Committee of Detained Disappeared Persons in Honduras. ",

Once again I m urgently calling on all European entities to finally take action and look for democratic solutions with both Spain and Catalonia,  he added.

        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Donald Trump\u2019s attorneys asked a U.S. judge to bar accusations about his personal conduct that have arisen during the presidential election campaign, which would include allegations of sexual misconduct, from the upcoming civil trial over Trump University. Students at Trump University claim they were defrauded by its real estate seminars. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has faced allegations from women that he inappropriately touched them. Trump denied those accusations. In a court filing late on Thursday, attorneys for Trump said evidence and statements from the election campaign should be barred from trial because they could unfairly prejudice the jury. The trial is set to begin on Nov. 28. Evidence including Trump\u2019s campaign speeches, tweets, his tax issues and controversy over his personal charity should not be considered by jurors, the filing said. All audio and video recordings publicized during the campaign should also be barred, the filing said, along with evidence about Trump\u2019s beauty pageants, casinos and corporate bankruptcies. \u201cBefore trial begins in this case, prospective members of the jury will have the opportunity to cast their vote for president,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote. \u201cIt is in the ballot box where they are free to judge Mr. Trump based on all this and more.\u201d A spokeswoman for the plaintiffs declined to comment.  Trump\u2019s lawyers had argued that the lawsuit, filed in 2013 in a San Diego federal court, should be dismissed because the New York real estate mogul, while personally involved in developing the concept and curriculum, relied on others to manage Trump University by the time the plaintiffs purchased seminars.  Trump set off an uproar earlier this year when he accused the judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, of being biased against him because of the Trump\u2019s pledge to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico. Curiel was born in Indiana and is of Mexican descent. Trump is trailing in the polls to Democrat Hillary Clinton with less than three weeks until Election Day.  Trump\u2019s lawyers also asked Curiel to exclude evidence about students\u2019 finances from the trial, saying the affordability of Trump University was not relevant to the trial. Lawyers for the students asked in separate court filings to bar other evidence, including testimonials attesting to the value of the seminars, partly because they are irrelevant to whether Trump University misrepresented the qualifications of its instructors.

Both countries have worked hard to improve interaction between their militaries to avoid any miscalculations in areas like the South China Sea where both regularly fly military aircraft and sail warships. But there is deep mistrust, with Beijing having been angered by what it views as provocative U.S. military flights and naval patrols in the disputed East China Sea and South China Sea, and suspicious of close U.S. defense ties with South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and increasingly India. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last week that Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation, something Beijing has opposed as an attempt by democracies to gang up on it. Speaking at a monthly news briefing, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said it was happy to see positive developments in military relations with the United States that both countries leaders attached importance to.  Looking to the future, we are willing to work with the U.S. side to respect each other, deepen mutual trust, focus on practical exchanges and cooperation and appropriately manage and control disputes, to continue injecting positive energy in the development of ties,  Ren added. China, a strategic rival to the United States and India, is also vital to Trump s efforts to roll back North Korea s efforts to create nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the United States, an issue expected to top the agenda in Trump s Nov. 8-10 Beijing visit.

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Saturday said she regretted saying \u201chalf\u201d of Republican rival Donald Trump\u2019s supporters belonged in a \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d but made no apologies for calling out \u201cprejudice and paranoia\u201d among Trump\u2019s campaign and supporters. \u201cLast night I was \u2018grossly generalistic,\u2019 and that\u2019s never a good idea. I regret saying \u2018half\u2019 - that was wrong,\u201d Clinton said in a statement, the day after comments at a fundraiser in New York. But \u201cTrump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI won\u2019t stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign.\u201d Republicans and Trump supporters responded fiercely on social media to Clinton\u2019s remarks at the LGBT fundraiser and the episode threatened to distract from her efforts to paint Trump as unqualified for the presidency.  But Trump on Saturday sought to use Clinton\u2019s comments to make the same charge about her. \u201cHow can she be President of our country when she has such contempt and disdain for so many great Americans?\u201d a Trump  statement asked. \u201cHillary Clinton should be ashamed of herself, and this proves beyond a doubt that she is unfit and incapable to serve as President of the United States,\u201d he added.  At Friday night\u2019s fundraiser, Clinton said Trump had given voice to hateful rhetoric through his behavior as a candidate for the White House in the Nov. 8 election.  \u201cTo just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the \u2018basket of deplorables,\u2019\u201d Clinton said. \u201cUnfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.\u201d  Some of those were irredeemable, she said, but they did not represent America. The other basket of Trump\u2019s supporters constituted individuals desperate for change who felt let down by the government and the economy, Clinton added. \u201cThey don\u2019t buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different,\u201d Clinton said.  \u201cThose are people we have to understand and empathize with, as well.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign hammered on Clinton throughout the day. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s low opinion of the people that support this campaign should be denounced in the strongest possible terms,\u201d Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana and Trump\u2019s running mate, said at the Values Voter Summit in Washington. \u201cSo let me just say from the bottom of my heart: Hillary, they are not a basket of anything. They are Americans, and they deserve your respect.\u201d Trump, a New York businessman who has never run for political office before, regularly says things that some consider insulting, racist or off-color. On Friday night, he told supporters in Pensacola, Florida, that Clinton could shoot someone and not be prosecuted. \u201cBecause she\u2019s being so protected, she could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching right smack in the middle of the heart and she wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted, okay?\u201d he said. [nL1N1BM031]   But Clinton\u2019s remarks got top billing on Twitter where the  hashtag #BasketOfDeplorables was trending, with shows of  condemnation and support for Clinton. Twitter user Basketeer Vendetta, under the account Vendetta92429, tweeted a photo of Trump supporters wearing campaign T-shirts and hats, adding: \u201cProud to be part of the #BasketOfDeplorables with my fellow Americans.\u201d And Trump himself tweeted: \u201cWow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!\u201d But some Twitter users agreed with Clinton, referencing  remarks by Trump that have been called racist, such as when he described some Mexican immigrants drug dealers and rapists. Clinton\u2019s comment could nevertheless end up being a boon to Trump. \u201cAs long as Trump stays out of the way and doesn\u2019t overshadow Hillary\u2019s comment, her \u2018basket of deplorables\u2019 comment should dominate the media in the coming days and runs the risk of negatively defining her campaign,\u201d said Republican strategist Doug Heye. Republican strategist Ana Navarro, who has been highly critical of Trump, said Clinton might have crossed an important line. \u201cWhen you are running for President, you are running to represent all Americans, even the ones you think are deplorable,\u201d said Navarro. But Jamal Simmons, a Democratic consultant, said the remarks probably would not wrest voters from Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019re moving to the part of the election process where there\u2019s a lot less persuasion of new voters and more persuasion of the people who like you to turn out and work to elect you,\u201d he added. Many of Clinton\u2019s fundraisers have been closed to the media, but not the one on Friday night.   Some critics likened Clinton\u2019s observation to 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201c47 percent\u201d comment in which he said 47 percent of voters are dependent upon the government and would vote for President Barack Obama no matter what. His campaign struggled to recover after the remark leaked.  But Democratic strategist Jim Manley, who supports Clinton, pointed out that Romney was talking about all voters, and Clinton was specifically describing Trump supporters. ",

        "title": "Macri's coalition sweeps Argentina's mid-term vote",
        "text": "BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Candidates allied with Argentine President Mauricio Macri enjoyed sweeping victories in Sunday s mid-term election, strengthening his position in Congress while dimming prospects for a political comeback by his predecessor Cristina Fernandez. A free-spending populist who nearly bankrupted the country during her 2007-2015 rule, Fernandez came in a distant second in her race for the Senate representing Buenos Aires, Argentina s most populous province. With 98 percent of ballots counted by the interior ministry, Macri s former education minister, Esteban Bullrich, had 41.34 percent versus 37.27 percent for Fernandez in the province that is home to nearly 40 percent of Argentine voters. Macri s  Cambiemos  or  Let s Change  coalition won the top five population centers of Buenos Aires City, and Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Santa Fe and Mendoza provinces. No single party had won all five in a mid-term vote since 1985.  Today the change elected in 2015 has been consolidated,  Vice President Gabriela Michetti told voters.  The election results, largely in line with pre-vote opinion polls, robbed the opposition of the two-thirds majority needed to block presidential vetoes, said Ignacio Labaqui, a local analyst with New York-based consultancy Medley Global Advisors.  This is a significant boost for the Macri administration, particularly because of the defeat of Cristina in Buenos Aires province,  Labaqui said. Fernandez s second-place showing still grants her one of the province s three Senate seats under Argentina s list system. One third of the Senate and half of the house were elected, and Macri s coalition will not have a majority.  The private sector has worried about a political resurgence by Fernandez, who is loved by millions of low-income Argentines helped by generous social spending during her administrations.  Fernandez thanked voters at her campaign headquarters and said her Citizen s Unity party would remain a firm opposition to Macri s economic model. Critics say Fernandez s growth-at-all-costs policies stoked inflation and distorted the economy through heavy-handed  currency controls. She has been further isolated politically by graft accusations. Fernandez, who as a senator will have immunity from arrest but not from trial, says there may have been corruption in her government but denies personal wrongdoing. Bullrich and Fernandez were tied in a non-binding primary in August but Bullrich pulled ahead in polls soon after, helped by a burst of economic growth as Fernandez failed to unify the Peronist opposition behind her.  People are more confident in the future, the economy, in making investments. They are tired of corruption and populism,  said Cecilia de Francesca, a 50-year-old writer who was celebrating at the Cambiemos campaign headquarters.  Argentina s Merval stock index and its peso currency have strengthened on bets Fernandez would not get enough support to launch a serious bid for the presidency in 2019. Investors, particularly in Argentina s vast agriculture and budding shale oil sectors, have said they want to see Macri push through labor and tax reforms aimed at lowering business costs in Latin America s third-biggest economy.

        "text": " WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A series of tweets by White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday commenting on strong February job creation figures may have run afoul of federal guidance barring most officials from commenting on key economic data within an hour of its release.  The rule, Statistical Policy Directive Number 3, is meant to \u201cpreserve the distinction between the policy-neutral release of data by statistical agencies and their interpretation by policy officials,\u201d the White House budget office explained when it published the most recent version in September 1985.  Jason Furman, who led President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, noted on Twitter that the rule had been in place for decades: \u201cEveryone has followed it. Until now.\u201d  Asked about the tweets at a White House news briefing, Spicer said the posts simply repeated public information and did not provide any analysis that could have disrupted markets.  \u201cWe\u2019re excited to see so many Americans back to work,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I apologize if we were a little excited.\u201d  Erica Groshen, who led the Labor Department\u2019s statistical arm for four years under Obama, in her own comment on Twitter called the directive a \u201cbest practice\u201d separating non-partisan number crunchers from officials with a more-political bent.  In its monthly report on U.S. employment, released at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT), the Labor Department said non-farm employers added 235,000 workers to their payrolls, with the unemployment rate dropping a tenth of a percentage point to 4.7 percent.  The monthly jobs data sets the tone for financial markets worldwide, and the robust pace of employment growth in February was seen as giving the Federal Reserve a green light to raise interest rates next week.  Twenty-four minutes after the data was released, Spicer tweeted, \"Great news for American workers: economy added 235,000 new jobs, unemployment rate drops to 4.7% in first report for @POTUS Trump.\"  Minutes later, he offered a fresh post: \"Not a bad way to start day 50 of this Administration.\"  Spicer was not alone.  White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, in his own tweet at 9:02 a.m. (1402 GMT), appeared to hand the credit for the job growth to President Donald Trump: \"@POTUS Trump delivers in first #JobsReport. 235,000 new jobs and unemployment rate down to 4.7%. Great news for American workers!\"  Vice President Mike Pence also got into the act.  Trump, who is not shy when it comes to using Twitter, had paved the way, retweeting a post from the Drudge Report that said simply, \u201cGREAT AGAIN: +235,000.\u201d  ",

        "title": "Iceland PM calls snap election after coalition party quits over 'breach of trust'",
        "text": "REYKJAVIK (Reuters) - Iceland s prime minister called for a snap parliamentary election on Friday after one party in the ruling coalition quit the government formed less than nine months ago. The outgoing party, Bright Future, cited a  breach of trust  after Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson s party allegedly tried to cover up a scandal involving his father.  That leaves the country, whose economy was wrecked by the collapse of its banking system nearly a decade ago, facing its second snap election in less than a year. The outgoing government would be the shortest-living in Iceland s history. The previous government was felled by the Panama Papers scandal over offshore tax havens.   We have lost the majority and I don t see anything that indicates we can regain that. I am calling an election,  Benediktsson told reporters. He said he would be looking to hold the election in November though that would mean it would not be possible to finish next year s budget. It is ultimately up to President Gudni Johannesson, whom Benediktsson will meet with on Saturday, to make the decision on a new election.  If he accepts the call for an election he is likely to ask the government to stay in place until a new coalition is formed but he could also ask other parties to try form a majority. Johannesson was not immediately available for comment. The news knocked more than 1 percent off the value of the Icelandic crown against the euro and the dollar. The scandal revolves around a letter written by Benediktsson s father to help an old friend have his criminal record expunged after he was convicted of sex offences against children.    The board of Bright Future has decided to terminate cooperation with the government of Bjarni Benediktsson,  the party said in a statement.  The reason for the split is a serious breach of trust within the government.   The Ministry of Justice, under Sigridur Andersen, a member of Benediktsson s Independence Party, initially refused to disclose who had written the letter of recommendation. She was later ordered to do so by a parliamentary committee. Andersen told broadcaster Stod 2 that she had informed Benediktsson about his father s involvement in July but had not told anyone else.       I was told by the justice minister that we were discussing confidential matters, which followed the rules of the ministry...I decided to handle the issue as a confidential matter,  Benediktsson said. He had later informed the chairmen of the coalition parties, he said.  First, it was illegal for me to indulge the information, second, I informed them when I could.  The prime minister s father, Benedikt Sveinsson, confirmed on Friday that he had signed a letter supporting his friend s application to have his  honor restored , a procedure that effectively erases a criminal record. Among the requirements is a letter of recommendation from a close friend or associate.        Sveinsson said he had not discussed the letter with anyone.  This week, it came forth that my father had written a letter... I couldn t have written such a letter myself and I will never try to defend that,  Bendiktsson told a news  conference. Capital Economics economist Stephen Brown said a change of government could frustrate plans to overhaul Iceland s monetary policy framework. Benediktsson s administration has asked experts to look at options, including pegging the crown to the euro or the pound to keep sharp shifts in the currency from  destabilising the economy. The central bank cut interest rates four times in the year to June to tame the crown. The currency has soared on the back of a tourism boom that has helped the economy recover from years of crisis but increased the risks of overheating. The strong currency is also hurting Iceland s exports.       I think if there s going to be another election and possibly the chance of a more left-wing government, then that probably decreases the chance of monetary policy being loosened any further in the future,  Brown said.   That could be quite important.  ",

        "title": "Kentucky lawmakers pass 'right-to-work' legislation",
        "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers in Kentucky passed a bill on Saturday making it the 27th U.S. state to allow workers the right to work in union-represented shops and receive union-negotiated benefits without paying dues to the representing body.  Republican lawmakers in a handful of states have passed similar so called \u201cright-to-work\u201d and anti-union laws in recent years. Supporters say the measures spur economic growth while opponents cast the laws as assaults on organized labor and blue-collar workers that limit union revenues. The effort to pass the legislation in Kentucky came two months after Republicans won control of the state\u2019s General Assembly for the first time since 1921. Republicans now control both chambers in the state\u2019s legislature and the governor\u2019s office.  A Kentucky Senate committee on Friday passed the \u201cright-to-work\u201d bill, sending it to the full Senate, which passed it during a rare Saturday session.  \u201cI personally have no problem with an individual opting to be part of a labor union ... but government shouldn\u2019t stand in the way of someone who opts not to join a union,\u201d said Speaker of the House Jeff Hoover in a statement earlier this week. It is widely expected that Republican Governor Matt Bevin will sign the bill into law in the coming days. If so, Kentucky will immediately become the 27th state and last Southern state to enact \u201cright-to-work\u201d legislation. The state Senate also passed an ultrasound abortion bill that was approved by the House on Thursday. Supporters of the \u201cright-to-work\u201d measure say it will make Kentucky more competitive with neighboring states with similar laws in attracting new business. Kentucky has been unable to pass \u201cright-to-work\u201d legislation in the past because of its strong union ties across the state, labor leaders said. The Republican-led state Senate had passed similar bills in recent years, but House Democrats refused to hear the bills. \u201cThe future of the fight is in, as best we can, trying to stop the erosion of wages, benefits and safety,\u201d said Caitlin Lally, a spokeswoman for the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 227 in Louisville and vice president of the Greater Louisville Central Labor Council. Hundreds of Democrats heeded their party leaders\u2019 call for a protest and packed the Capitol rotunda in Frankfort on Saturday.  \u201cPoliticians didn\u2019t create the labor movement, and politicians won\u2019t destroy the labor movement,\u201d said DeLane Adams, spokesman for the AFL-CIO Southern regional office.

        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Foreign leaders can t think they can get away with meeting exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama just because they are doing it in a personal capacity, as they still represent their government, a senior Chinese official said on Saturday. China considers the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, to be a dangerous separatist. The Nobel Peace Prize winning monk says he simply seeks genuine autonomy for his Himalayan homeland. Visits by the Dalai Lama to foreign countries infuriate China, and fewer and fewer national leaders are willing to meet him, fearing the consequences of Chinese anger, though some have tried to placate Beijing by saying they are meeting him in a personal not official capacity. Zhang Yijiong, who heads the Communist Party s Tibet working group, told reporters on the sidelines of a party congress that there could be no excuses to meeting the Dalai Lama.  Although some people say, the Dalai is a religious figure, our government didn t put in an appearance, it was just individual officials, this is incorrect,  said Zhang, who is also a vice minister at the United Front Work Department, which has led failed talks with the Dalai Lama s representatives.  Officials, in their capacity as officials, attending all foreign-related activities represent their governments. So I hope governments around the world speak and act with caution and give full consideration their friendship with China and their respect for China s sovereignty,  he added.  China took control of Tibet in 1950 in what it calls a  peaceful liberation  and has piled pressure on foreign governments to shun the Dalai Lama, using economic means to punish those who allow him in. China strongly denies accusations of rights abuses in Tibet, saying its rule has brought prosperity to what was a remote and backward region, and that it fully respects the religious and cultural rights of the Tibetan people. China also insists that Tibet in an integral part of its territory and has been for centuries. Zhang, who worked in Tibet from 2006-2010 as a deputy Communist Party boss, said that Tibetan Buddhism was a special religion  born in our ancient China .  It s a Chinese religion. It didn t come in from the outside,  he said. ",

        "text": "JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan needs $1.7 billion in aid next year to help 6 million people   half of its population   cope with the effects of war, hunger and economic decline, the government and the United Nations announced on Wednesday. South Sudan slid into civil war in late 2013, two years after gaining independence from Sudan and a third of its 12 million population has fled their homes.  The conflict was sparked by a feud between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar, who is being held in South Africa, and eventually led to a fight along ethnic lines.  We are calling for $1.72 billion to continue providing life-saving assistance and protection for 6 million people most in need in South Sudan,  Alain Noudehou, the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, told a news conference. Humanitarian assistance was needed for people suffering the effects of displacement, food insecurity, malnutrition, violence and economic decline, Noudehou said. Since the conflict began, about 4 million people have been forced to flee their homes, with nearly 1.9 million people who have internally displaced and about 2.1 million who have fled to neighboring countries, he said. The conflict has also led to a cut in crude oil production, which is a key foreign exchange earner, and the ensuing insecurity has hampered cultivation of food. Also at the news conference was South Sudan s Humanitarian Affairs Minister Hussein Mar Nyuot.   I believe if we don t get the amount ($1.72 billion) and the donors don t respond to this more crisis in South Sudan will happen. That means 2018 might be worse than 2017,  he said. ",

        "text": "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The leader of the New Zealand First Party, which emerged as the kingmaker after an inconclusive weekend election, said on Wednesday he would not make a decision on who should form government until after the Oct. 7 release of a final count. Still to be counted are  special votes , ballots from overseas voters and those who vote outside their home constituencies, which account for 15 percent of total votes. While they are not expected to change the result, with the ruling National Party ahead with a comfortable 10 point lead, they could add seats to the possible Labour-Green coalition, making New Zealand First more comfortable to go with them, despite the fact they did not win the largest number of seats.  I can t with any intelligence - and nor can my colleagues -tell you what we re going to do until we ve seen all the facts,  Winston Peters, the outspoken leader of the New Zealand First Party, told a press conference in Wellington. Peters, who spoke after meeting with his caucus, gave little away on what his party will demand in return for supporting Prime Minister Bill English or opposition Labour leader Ardern to form a coalition government. Negotiations are expected to take weeks, with those who have worked with Peters saying the final decision will be his.  Nobody knows what Winston Peters or NZ First will do, at this stage they don t know what they ll do,  Tau Henare, a former lawmaker for both NZ First and National, tweeted on Wednesday.  But when Winston finds out, they ll know.  The 72-year-old Peters, a colorful populist and former foreign minister, has served in both National and Labour governments in the past. The National Party secured 58 seats, ahead of the 52 won by the Green Party and Labour in Saturday s election, leaving both still in need of NZ First s nine seats to reach the tally of 61 required to form a government. Both parties have indicated in recent days that they are willing to offer the carrot of the deputy leadership to Peters.  An alternative option, and one that Peters took in 2005, was to strike a confidence and supply deal, in which New Zealand  First would vote in favor of a governing party s important legislation, like the budget, but remain outside cabinet. On paper, Peters has more in common with Labour policies,   including curbing immigration, and those who know him say that he d find the option of serving as a high-ranking cabinet member to a relative political newcomer like 37-year-old Ardern an attractive proposition. He has also been scathing of English s performance as leader. But Peters also has a track record of siding with the party that wins the most votes in an election, and is less than complimentary about Labour s minority partner, the Green Party.  Everything is negotiable,  said NZ First MP Tracey Martin.  It depends how flexible the National Party wants to be, I suppose.  Peters has been in parliament since 1978 and was a member of the National Party until he formed New Zealand First in 1993. He was first cast as kingmaker in 1996, when he famously put off coalition talks the day after the election to go fishing. ",

        "title": "Denmark to ramp up cyber security efforts: defense minister",
        "text": "COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark intends to invest to boost efforts to prevent cyber attacks in a strategy to be presented early next year, its defense minister said on Tuesday.  We are going to spend more money in this area,  Claus Hjort Frederiksen told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Copenhagen, though he declined to disclose a figure. Cyber security is  very high on the agenda  for the right-leaning government, but also for the broad selection of Danish political parties negotiating a new defense strategy for the coming six years, he said. The government would like to expand an early warning system with sensors that detects when Danish companies or authorities are under attack from, for example, malware.  To some degree we do have a system today, but we would like to expand it to the strategic infrastructure and to private companies,  he told Reuters. The government also wants to increase the preventive capacity at the Danish center for cyber security to increase its ability to better catch and inform about imminent cyber threats, he said. World s no.1 container shipper and one of Denmark s largest companies Maersk was hit by major cyber attack in June, one of the biggest-ever disruptions to hit global shipping.  The government also works for a deeper cooperation between authorities and private companies in battling cyber attacks, Frederiksen said. He said he believed companies were sometimes reluctant to inform they had been hit by cyber attacks, because they were afraid to scare off customers or investors.  Frederiksen said he saw the overall cyber threat as  one of the greatest threats of our time .  If you can undermine our democratic nations by hacking the energy systems or the communication systems or the financial systems it will undermine our own people s belief in our societies  ability to protect them,  he said. Russia hacked the Danish defense network and gained access to employees  emails in 2015 and 2016, Frederiksen said in April. Danish troops will get training in how to deal with Russian misinformation before being sent to join a NATO military build-up in Estonia in January, Frederiksen said in July. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - President Donald Trump is set to sign an order to greatly reduce the role climate change plays in decision making across the U.S. government, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the administration\u2019s plan. The order, which could be signed this week, aims to reverse former Democratic President Barack Obama's broad approach for addressing climate change, the report said. (bloom.bg/2nkDvKo) The directive will urge the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to undo the Clean Power Plan, the Bloomberg report said. The Clean Power Plan is Obama\u2019s centerpiece initiative to combat climate change, requiring states to slash emissions of carbon dioxide, but it was never implemented due to legal challenges launched by several Republican states. According to the report, the measure would direct U.S. regulators to rescind Obama-era regulations limiting oil industry emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The order will also involve a reconsideration of the government\u2019s use of a metric known as the \u201csocial cost of carbon\u201d, which weighs the potential economic damage from climate change, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Trump has long signaled his intention to reverse Obama\u2019s climate-change initiatives, but the Republican president has vowed his planned overhaul of green regulation would not jeopardize America\u2019s water and air quality. Reuters reported earlier this month that the White House had proposed to slash a quarter of the EPA\u2019s budget, targeting climate-change programs and those designed to prevent air and water pollution like lead contamination. The Bloomberg report said that some of the changes could happen immediately, while others could take years to implement. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two former U.S. officials, intelligence director James Clapper and deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, will testify next month in a congressional investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Senate Judiciary Committee said on Tuesday. Congressional committees began investigating the issue after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacking of the Democratic political groups to try to sway the election toward Republican Donald Trump. Moscow has denied any such meddling. Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, and Yates, the former deputy attorney general, will testify on May 8 before the Judiciary Committee\u2019s subcommittee on crime and terrorism, Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley said in a statement. More witnesses may be added. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday he was \u201ca little troubled\u201d that the Senate Intelligence investigation appeared to be moving slowly. Reuters reported on Monday that the probe, the Senate\u2019s main investigation into allegations of Russian election meddling, has a much smaller staff than previous high-profile congressional investigations. Clapper, Yates and another official who also served under former President Barack Obama, ex-CIA Director James Brennan, were scheduled to testify to the House of Representatives intelligence committee in March but that hearing was canceled by the panel\u2019s chairman, Republican Devin Nunes. Nunes, a Trump ally, recused himself from the Russia investigation in April after receiving information about intelligence agency surveillance of foreign nationals that swept up some information about members of Trump\u2019s transition team. His decision to hold a news conference and discuss the information with Trump before disclosing it to Democrats raised questions about whether he could lead a credible investigation. The House committee on Friday invited Yates, Clapper and Brennan to appear at a public hearing to be scheduled after May 2. The Judiciary subcommittee\u2019s chairman, Republican Lindsay Graham, said he wanted to ask Clapper and Yates whether they knew about a court order allowing FBI surveillance of the communications of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page in 2016. The Washington Post reported this month that such a warrant had been issued. Clapper said in a March television interview he was not aware of any wiretapping of Trump or advisers. \u201cI want to get to the bottom of this,\u201d Graham said on Fox News. ",

Reuters had already reported that Niger had sought to arm U.S drones against jihadist groups operating on its border with Mali, but it had not been previously reported that an agreement had been reached. An ambush in Niger that killed four U.S. soldiers in October has thrown a spotlight on the U.S. counterterrorism mission in the West African country.     The U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the permission for drones had been granted earlier this week but the capability had not yet been used.  What began as a small U.S. training operation has expanded to an 800-strong force that accompanies the Nigeriens on intelligence gathering and other missions. It includes a $100 million drone base in the central Nigerien city of Agadez which at present only deploys surveillance drones. U.S. forces do not have a direct combat mission in Niger, but their assistance to its military does include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance in their efforts to target violent Islamist organizations.

        "text": "BOSTON (Reuters) - A Massachusetts county sheriff has proposed sending prison inmates from around the United States to build the proposed wall along the Mexican border that is one of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s most prominent campaign promises. \u201cI can think of no other project that would have such a positive impact on our inmates and our country than building this wall,\u201d Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said at his swearing-in ceremony for a fourth term in office late Wednesday.  \u201cAside from learning and perfecting construction skills, the symbolism of these inmates building a wall to prevent crime in communities around the country, and to preserve jobs and work opportunities for them and other Americans upon release, can be very powerful,\u201d he said. Hodgson, who like Trump is a Republican, said inmates from around the country could build the proposed wall, described by Trump as a powerful deterrent to illegal immigration. Trump, who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, insisted during his campaign that he would convince the Mexican government to pay for the wall, though Mexican officials have repeatedly said they would not do so. Officials in the Trump transition office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The United States has a long history of prison labor, with advocates of the idea saying that putting inmates to work can help them learn skills that prepare them for their return to society after completing their sentences. Opponents contend that inmates are not fairly compensated. The federal prisons system operates some 53 factories around the United States that produced about $500 million worth of clothing, electronics, furniture and other goods in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, according to its financial statements. Still, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union in Massachusetts said Hodgson\u2019s proposal could violate prisoners\u2019 rights. \u201cThe proposal is perverse, it\u2019s inhumane and very likely unconstitutional,\u201d ACLU staff counsel Laura Rotolo said in a phone interview. \u201cIt certainly has nothing to do with helping prisoners in Massachusetts or their families. It\u2019s about politics.\u201d In response to a request by the Trump transition office, the Department of Homeland Security last month identified more than 400 miles (644 km) along the U.S.-Mexico border where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by Reuters.  The document contained an estimate that building that section of fence would cost more than $11 billion. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Three members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, ahead of a planned hearing late this month, said Mylan NV appears to have greatly overcharged the military for its lifesaving allergy treatment EpiPen and asked the pharmaceutical company when it plans to reimburse the Department of Defense. The reimbursement demand came in a letter on Monday to Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch, from Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and committee members Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, both Democrats. \u201cWe are alarmed that Mylan may have overcharged our military for this life-saving drug,\u201d the Senators wrote. They said Mylan for years may have knowingly misclassified EpiPen as a generic product in order to avoid higher rebates the company would have had to pay state and federal Medicaid programs had it been classified as a branded product. The Medicaid rebate for a generic is 13 percent compared with a minimum of 23.1 percent for a branded medicine. Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin declined to comment on the letter, or its demands. The drug company has come under fire from consumers and politicians in recent months for raising the U.S. list price on a pack of two EpiPen injectors nearly six-fold to $600 since 2008. Lawmakers, including Grassley, have called for investigations into Mylan\u2019s pricing, helping put the product in the spotlight amid a larger debate over big drug price increases in the United States.  Pentagon spending on EpiPen jumped to $57 million over the past year from $9 million in 2008, an increase driven by volume and by hefty price hikes that had a bigger bite on prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies, Reuters reported on Oct. 28, citing previously unreported data.   The Pentagon gets a government discount on EpiPens dispensed at military treatment facilities and by mail order. But nearly half of its spending was at retail pharmacies where it most recently paid an average of $509 for EpiPen and $528 for EpiPen Jr two-packs - three times higher than its discounted rate, according to the data. The Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to hold a hearing  Nov. 30 on EpiPen pricing and related matters.    ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. and Chinese diplomatic and defense chiefs will meet Wednesday for a security dialogue that Washington says will focus on curbing North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. The talks in Washington will involve U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis as well as  China\u2019s top diplomat, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, and General Fang Fenghui, chief of state of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, the U.S. State Department said. It will be the inaugural session of the U.S.-China  Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, a framework launched by President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during a summit in Florida in April. The State Department said the aim was \u201cto expand areas of cooperation while narrowing differences on key diplomatic and security issues.\u201d U.S.-China ties have warmed since the April summit, in spite of continued U.S. concerns about China\u2019s pursuit of territory in the South China Sea and a large trade imbalance.      Tillerson has said North Korea will top the agenda next week and made clear that Washington wanted more help from China in pressing Pyongyang to abandon its weapons programs, calling Chinese efforts so far \u201cnotable\u201d but \u201cuneven.\u201d The focus on North Korea has been sharpened by dozens of North Korean missile launches and two nuclear bomb tests since the beginning of last year.  North Korea says it is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States, and this week Mattis called it the \u201cmost urgent\u201d threat to U.S. national security. China is party to U.N. economic sanctions on North Korea.  But it remains the country\u2019s main ally and trading partner and has been reluctant to impose the sort of punishing measures experts say are needed to get Pyongyang to abandon its weapons programs. In Beijing, asked about the talks, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, said, \u201cThe two sides are in close communication about the schedule, but the issues discussed will be those that both countries are concerned about and that involve China-U.S. relations.\u201d He did not elaborate. On Tuesday, Tillerson said Washington was considering imposing \u201csecondary sanctions\u201d on foreign firms doing business with North Korea and had been in discussions with Beijing about the activities of entities inside China. A Washington think tank said this week that North Korea\u2019s effort to circumvent sanctions was complex but could be defeated by targeting relatively few Chinese firms. The U.N. Security Council expanded targeted sanctions against North Korea this month in the first such resolution agreed by the United States and China since Trump took office. Washington has been pushing for even tougher steps, including an oil embargo, bans of North Korea\u2019s airline and overseas workers and interception of its cargo ships. ",

        "text": "EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scotland s devolved government has recommended that its parliament at Holyrood withhold consent for legislation to withdraw Britain from the European Union, on the grounds that it could water down their powers, a document filed by the Scottish government said on Tuesday. The approval of the devolved parliaments in Scotland and Wales does not represent a veto to the Brexit process, although it would stretch Britain s constitutional tensions yet further by forcing the UK government of Prime Minister Theresa May to ignore the expressed wish of the devolved bodies. Scotland would work with the Welsh government to propose amendments to the bill which, if agreement were reached, would allow it to recommend its passage in the devolved assemblies, the document said. The bill will end the supremacy of EU law in the UK and convert all existing EU laws into domestic ones.  Along with the Welsh government, the Scottish government cannot recommend to the parliament that it gives consent to the bill as currently drafted,  the document filed with the Scottish parliament said.  The Scottish government is also clear that the result of withdrawal from the EU should not be centralization of power in Whitehall and Westminster. However, that is what the bill proposes.   Scotland s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been arguing that Brexit as proposed flies in the face of the devolution agreement, which up to now has allowed assemblies in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast to legislate on their own domestic policies such as health and education. Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to keep EU membership in a June 2016 referendum while England and Wales voted to leave.  It remains a matter of regret to the Scottish government that the UK plans to withdraw from the EU. The government nevertheless accepts that preparations should be made for withdrawal from the EU, including preserving a functioning legal system,  the document said.  The Scottish government s key objections to the bill as introduced relate to the provisions on the competence of the Scottish parliament and government (...) and those on powers for UK and Scottish ministers to alter domestic law,  it said. The Scottish and Welsh governments argue that returning powers now exercised by the EU to the UK government will imply restrictions on the power of Scottish and Welsh chambers. But Britain s Scotland minister, David Mundell, has said that the repeal will ultimately result in a boost in devolved parliamentary power.     ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Several countries, the United Nations and journalist groups are demanding the release of Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo from detention in Myanmar. The reporters were arrested on Dec. 12 after being invited to meet police officials on the outskirts of Yangon. They had worked on stories about a military crackdown in Rakhine state, scene of more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh since late August. Myanmar s Ministry of Information has said the reporters  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media,  and released a photo of them in handcuffs. It said the reporters and two policemen faced charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years, though officials said they have not been charged. Their exact whereabouts is not known. Reuters  driver Myothant Tun dropped them off at a police compound and the two reporters and two police officers headed to a nearby restaurant. The journalists did not return to the car.  Reuters President and Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler said  the arrests were a  blatant attack on press freedom  and called for the immediate release of the journalists.  Here are reactions to their detention from politicians and press freedom advocates around the world:   - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States was  demanding their immediate release or information as to the circumstances around their disappearance.   - British Minister for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field said,   I absolutely strongly disapprove of the idea of journalists, going about their everyday business, being arrested. We will make it clear in the strongest possible terms that we feel that they need to be released at the earliest possible opportunity.  - Swedish Foreign Minister Margot called the arrests a  threat to a democratic and peaceful development of Myanmar and that region.  She said,  We do not accept that journalists are attacked or simply kidnapped or that they disappear ... To be able to send journalists to this particular area is of crucial importance.   - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said countries should do everything possible to secure the journalists  release and freedom of the press in Myanmar. Guterres said,  It is clearly a concern in relation to the erosion of press freedom in the country.  He added:  And probably the reason why these journalists were arrested is because they were reporting on what they have seen in relation to this massive human tragedy.   - Canada s Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, the former managing director and editor, consumer news, at Thomson Reuters, tweeted that she was  deeply concerned  by the reports about the arrests.  Freedom of the press is essential for democracy and must be preserved,  she said. - President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani called on Myanmar to protect media freedoms and release the two reporters. - Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury, information adviser to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, said,  We strongly denounce arrests of Reuters journalists and feel that those reporters be free immediately so that they can depict the truth to the world by their reporting.   - Japan s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s spokesman Motosada Matano said his government was closely watching the situation, and that Japan has been conducting a dialogue with the Myanmar government on human rights in Myanmar in general. - The Committee to Protect Journalists said,  We call on local authorities to immediately, unconditionally release Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. These arrests come amid a widening crackdown which is having a grave impact on the ability of journalists to cover a story of vital global importance.  - The Paris-based Reporters Without Borders said there was no justification for the arrests. Daniel Bastard, the head of the group s Asia-Pacific desk, said the charges being considered were  completely spurious . - The Southeast Asian Press Alliance asked for the immediate release of the journalists.  These two journalists are only doing their jobs in trying to fill the void of information on the Rohingya conflict,  said SEAPA executive director Edgardo Legaspi.  With this arrest, the government seems to be sending the message that all military reports should be off limits to journalists.  - The Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists, a group of local reporters who have demonstrated against past prosecutions of journalists, decried the  unfair arrests that affect media freedom .  A reporter must have the right to get information and write news ethically,  said video journalist A Hla Lay Thu Zar - a member of the group s executive committee. - The Foreign Correspondents  Club of Myanmar said it was  appalled  by the arrests and  gravely concerned  about the state of press freedom in Myanmar. It called on authorities to ensure the reporters  safety and allow their families to see them. - The Foreign Correspondents  Club in neighboring Thailand said it was  alarmed by the use of this draconian law with its heavy penalties against journalists simply doing their jobs.  The club called for the journalists to be released.  Wielding such a blunt legal instrument has an intimidating effect on other journalists, and poses a real threat to media freedom,  it said.  ",

        "title": "China warns against livestreaming after 'rooftopper' falls to death",
        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - A young Chinese climbing enthusiast s fatal fall from a skyscraper while making a selfie video on a $15,000  rooftopping  dare has spurred warnings by state media against the perils of livestreaming.  Wu Yongning plunged to his death from a 62-storey building in central China on Nov. 8, the day he stopped posting videos of his skyscraper exploits on Weibo, China s equivalent of Twitter. A month later, his girlfriend confirmed the death of the 26-year old in a Weibo post.  Wu, who had more than 60,000 followers of his Weibo account, was looking to win a prize of 100,000 yuan ($15,110) for a filmed stunt atop Huayuan Hua Center in Changsha, capital of Hunan province, media said over the weekend.  His death was a reminder of the need for stronger supervision of livestreaming apps, the official China Daily said on Tuesday.  Some of them try to hype things up with obscene and dangerous things, and their purpose is to attract more eyeballs and make a profit,  it said in a commentary.  Tens of thousands of Chinese post videos of themselves in a bid for stardom on the livestreaming scene, whose popularity has grown rapidly, particularly in the e-commerce, social networking and gaming sectors. Wu, who used to post videos of himself scaling tall buildings with no safety equipment, hoped to use the prize to pay his mother s medical bills, the Changsha Evening News said.  It was unclear which livestreaming platform Wu intended to post on.   There should be a bottom line for livestreaming platforms, and supervision should leave no loopholes,  ran a comment in the online edition of the People s Daily.  Wu s videos on his Weibo microblog had attracted several million views each.  ",

        "title": "Planned Parenthood protests aimed at House Republicans' offices",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Planned Parenthood, the U.S. medical services provider that could lose federal funding under the Republican-controlled House of Representatives\u2019 healthcare overhaul bill, said it would hold dozens of demonstrations outside the local offices of members of Congress across the country on Friday and Saturday. The protests will target some of the 217 Republican representatives who voted to pass legislation on Thursday that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the healthcare law passed in 2010 under former President Barack Obama. \u201cWe\u2019re standing together as women, people of color, immigrants, and as people of faith, and we\u2019re fighting back to make sure that every single politician in America knows that we will not stand for \u2018defunding\u2019 Planned Parenthood,\u201d Kelly Robinson, the national organizing director of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement.  The bill still needs approval by the U.S. Senate. President Donald Trump, a Republican, praised the bill\u2019s passage in the House but acknowledged that some of its provisions may change before it becomes law. A part of the Republicans\u2019 proposed American Health Care Act would prevent Planned Parenthood from being reimbursed for any of its services, including cancer screening and pre-natal care, through the Medicaid program for the poor. About 60 percent of the patients who use Planned Parenthood\u2019s 600 or so clinics are on Medicaid or other federal public health programs. Republican congressional offices from coast to coast were targeted on Friday, with protests planned at the offices of Representatives Rodney Frelinghuysen in Morristown, New Jersey, Kevin Yoderice in Shawnee Mission, Kansas, and Darrell Issa in Vista, California, among others. Many Republicans oppose any funding for Planned Parenthood, citing religious grounds, because its services include abortions, although it receives no federal funding or reimbursement for abortions, as stipulated by federal law. The Family Research Council, a Christian advocacy group, and other conservative policy groups praised the House bill as a tool to help limit access to abortions. Planned Parenthood says the bill would harm 2.5 million people who rely on it for basic health services. ",

        "title": "Trump to sign Russia sanctions, Moscow retaliates",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will sign legislation that imposes sanctions on Russia, the White House said on Friday, after Moscow ordered the United States to cut hundreds of diplomatic staff and said it would seize two U.S. diplomatic properties in retaliation for the bill. The U.S. Senate had voted almost unanimously on Thursday to slap new sanctions on Russia, forcing Trump to choose between a tough position on Moscow and effectively dashing his stated hopes for warmer ties with the country or to veto the bill amid investigations in possible collusion between his campaign and Russia. By signing the bill into law, Trump can not ease the sanctions against Russia unless he seeks congressional approval. Moscow\u2019s retaliation, announced by the Foreign Ministry on Friday, had echoes of the Cold War. If confirmed that Russia\u2019s move would affect hundreds of staff at the U.S. embassy, it would far outweigh the Obama administration\u2019s expulsion of 35 Russians in December. The legislation was in part a response to conclusions by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and to further punish Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014. Late on Friday, the White House issued a statement saying Trump would sign the bill after reviewing the final version. The statement made no reference to Russia\u2019s retaliatory measures. Russia had been threatening retaliation for weeks. Its response suggests it has set aside initial hopes of better ties with Washington under Trump, something the U.S. leader, before he was elected, had said he wanted to achieve.  Relations were already languishing at a post-Cold War low because of the allegations that Russian cyber interference in the election was intended to boost Trump\u2019s chances, something Moscow flatly denies. Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russian officials.    The Russian Foreign Ministry complained of growing anti-Russian feeling in the United States, accusing \u201cwell-known circles\u201d of seeking \u201copen confrontation\u201d. President Vladimir Putin had warned on Thursday that Russia would have to retaliate against what he called boorish U.S. behavior. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Friday that the Senate vote was the last straw. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by telephone that Russia was ready to normalize relations with the United States and to cooperate on major global issues. Lavrov and Tillerson \u201cagreed to maintain contact on a range of bilateral issues\u201d, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. The ministry said the United States had until Sept. 1 to reduce its diplomatic staff in Russia to 455 people, the number of Russian diplomats left in the United States after Washington expelled 35 Russians in December. It was not immediately clear how many U.S. diplomats and other workers would be forced to leave either the country or their posts, but the Interfax news agency cited an informed source as saying \u201chundreds\u201d of people would be affected. A diplomatic source told Reuters that it would be for the United States to decide which posts to cut, whether occupied by U.S. or Russian nationals.  An official at the U.S. Embassy, who declined to be named because they were not allowed to speak to the media, said the Embassy employed around 1,100 diplomatic and support staff in Russia, including Russian and U.S. citizens. Russian state television channel Rossiya 24 said over 700 staff would be affected but that was not confirmed by the foreign ministry or the U.S. embassy. The Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s statement said the passage of the bill confirmed \u201cthe extreme aggression of the United States in international affairs\u201d. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov met outgoing U.S. ambassador John Tefft on Friday to inform him of the counter measures, Russian news agencies reported. The U.S. Embassy said Tefft had expressed his \u201cstrong disappointment and protest\u201d. Most U.S. diplomatic staff, including around 300 U.S. citizens, work in the main embassy in Moscow, with others based in consulates in St Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Vladivostok. The Russian Foreign Ministry said it was also seizing a Moscow dacha compound used by U.S. diplomats for recreation, from Aug. 1, as well as a U.S. diplomatic warehouse in Moscow.  In December, the outgoing Obama administration seized two Russian diplomatic compounds - one in New York and another in Maryland - at the same time as it expelled Russian diplomats. Trump and Putin met for the first time at a G20 summit in Germany this month in what both sides described as a productive encounter, but Russian officials have become increasingly convinced that Congress and Trump\u2019s political opponents will not allow him to mend ties, even if he wants to. The European Union has also threatened to retaliate against new U.S. sanctions on Russia, saying they would harm the bloc\u2019s energy security by targeting projects including a planned new pipeline to bring Russian natural gas to northern Europe.     A European Commission spokesman in Brussels said the bloc would be following the sanctions process closely. ",
