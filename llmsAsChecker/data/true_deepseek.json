        "title": "UK opposition leader Corbyn wants close relationship with Europe",
        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - Britain s opposition Labour party wants a close relationship with the rest of Europe after Brexit, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told an audience at the United Nations in Geneva on Friday.  We want to see a close and cooperative relationship with our European neighbors outside the European Union, based on solidarity as well as mutual benefit and fair trade, along with a wider proactive internationalism across the globe,  he said.   My own country, Britain, is at a crossroads,  he said. The vote last year to leave the European Union meant hard thinking had to be done about Britain s role in the world, he said.  There are some who want to use Brexit to turn Britain in on itself, rejecting the outside world, viewing everyone as a feared competitor,  he said.  Others want to use Brexit to put rocket boosters under our current economic system s insecurities and inequalities. Turning Britain into a deregulated corporate tax haven, low wages, with limited rights, cut-price public services, in a wholly destructive race to the bottom.  Corbyn said his party stood for a completely different future, drawing on the internationalist traditions of the Labour movement and of Britain.  In a wide-ranging speech about human rights and multilateralism, he did not immediately comment on the Brexit divorce deal struck by Britain s Prime Minister Theresa May and the European Commission earlier on Friday.  The European Commission said that enough progress had been made in Brexit negotiations to allow a second phase of talks on future relations to begin. ",

        "title": "Pope candidly admits Church 'arrived late' in confronting abuse",
        "text": "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, in some of his most candid and personal comments on the sexual abuse of children by priests, said on Thursday that the Catholic Church had  arrived late  in dealing with the problem. Francis, speaking in unscripted remarks to a commission advising him on how to root out sexual abuse, also acknowledged that early in his papacy he had made one bad call in being too lenient with an Italian priest who later went on to abuse again. He also said he had decided to change current procedures for dealing with abusive priests by eliminating appeals trials in cases where there was definitive proof. Francis surprised members of the commission by putting aside his entire prepared speech and chatting to them.  There is the reality that the Church arrived at the consciousness of these crimes a bit late,  he said.  When consciousness arrives late, the means to resolve the problems also arrive late. I am aware of this difficulty but it is reality and I say it plainly: We arrived late.  Church sexual abuse broke into the open in the United States with reports of cases in Louisiana in 1984 and exploded in 2002, when journalists in Boston found that bishops had systematically moved abusers to new posts instead of defrocking them. Thousands of cases have come to light around the world as investigations have encouraged long-silent victims to go public, shattering the Church s reputation in places such as Ireland, and more than $2 billion has been paid in compensation.  The old practice of moving people around and not confronting the problem made consciences fall asleep,  he said. Francis acknowledged that the commission, which was founded in 2014, had to  swim against the tide,  a reference to high level defections from its ranks. Marie Collins of Ireland, a non-clerical member who was victim of priestly abuse when she was a child, quit in frustration in March, citing a  shameful  lack of cooperation within the Vatican. Another, Peter Saunders of Britain, took a leave of absence last year in protest over a lack of progress. Francis said that everyone had to realize that sexual abuse is  a sickness  with a high probability of relapse.  That person may repent today ... but may commit it again after two years. We have to put it into our heads that this is a sickness,  he said. Francis said he would change current Vatican procedures to severely limit chances of appeal for pedophile priests convicted by church tribunals, saying they often were overly legalistic, allowing for reduced sentences on procedural grounds.  I have decided to balance this out and say that if an abuse of a minor is proven, it is sufficient and there should be no recourse. If the proof is there. Period. It s definitive,  he said. Francis, who was elected in 2013, acknowledged he made one bad judgment early in his papacy concerning an Italian priest, Mauro Inzoli. In that case, the bishop of Crema, had ruled that Inzoli would be removed from the public ministry while remaining a priest but a Church tribunal ruled that he be defrocked. The pope sided with the bishop.  I was new (in the papacy) I did not understand these things well and chose the more benevolent of the two sentences but after two years the priest had a relapse. I learned from this,  Francis said. ",

        "title": "British PM May vows to stay as party plotters attempt to topple her",
        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday she would stay on as leader to provide stability after a former chairman of her  Conservative Party said he had garnered the support of 30 lawmakers who wanted her to quit. May is trying to face down a rebellion by some of her own lawmakers just as Britain enters a crucial stage in Brexit talks, 18 months before the country leaves the European Union and must redefine its place in the world. Some Conservative plotters say her authority is shattered beyond repair after a disastrous speech at her party s conference, which comes after she called a snap election and lost her party its majority in parliament. Speaking from her parliamentary constituency of Maidenhead in southern England, May said in a televised statement:  What the country needs is calm leadership and that s what I m providing with the full support of my cabinet.  Senior ministers rallied around May, who has just over a year to agree a divorce deal with the EU ahead of Britain s exit in March 2019. May said she planned to hold a scheduled meeting about Brexit with business leaders on Monday in Downing Street. But former party chairman Grant Shapps told BBC radio:  I think she should call a leadership election.  After May s bungled election, her failure to unite the cabinet and a poor party conference  the writing is on the wall,  he said. May s authority was already diminished by her decision to call a snap election in June that lost her party its majority in parliament days before Brexit talks opened. Though no Conservative ministers have publicly indicated any support for the plot, such a blunt demand for May to quit indicates the extent of her weakness while she attempts to navigate the intricacies of the negotiations to leave the EU. Her survival has so far been dependent on the absence of an obvious successor who could unite the party and the fear of an election that many Conservatives think would let opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn into power. Sterling fell earlier in the day but then rallied by around a quarter of a cent against the U.S. dollar following May s remarks. It later fell after U.S. payrolls data was released. May s speech to activists on Wednesday was ruined by coughing fits, a comedian handing her a bogus employment termination notice and by letters falling off the slogans on the set behind her. She had hoped to use the speech to her party in the northern English city of Manchester to revive her premiership.  Look, I ve had a cold all this week,  May said, adding that she would be updating lawmakers next week on her Brexit plans and introducing a draft bill to cap domestic energy prices. Shapps, who chaired the party between 2012 and 2015, said the plot to remove her existed before this week s party conference and included both supporters and opponents of Brexit. He said the group did not have a unified view on who should replace May. However, grassroots Conservative members did not share his desire for a change in leadership, said James Pearson, Vice President of the National Conservative Convention which represents the party s voluntary wing.  I don t think there s much support in the Conservative Party for Grant Shapps. I don t see this as anything that s really serious to be honest,  Pearson told Reuters.   The general feeling is we don t have the time or the appetite for a lengthy leadership election, nor do we actually want it,  Pearson, who sits on the Conservatives  Board, the party s ultimate decision-making body, added.     To trigger a formal leadership challenge, 48 Conservative lawmakers need to write to the chairman of the party s so-called 1922 committee.  Number 10 must be delighted to learn that it s Grant Shapps leading this alleged coup,  Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the 1922 committee, told BBC radio.  Grant has many talents, but one thing he doesn t have is a following in the party, so really I think this is now just going to fizzle out to be perfectly honest.  If May stays, talks on leaving the European Union will be guided by one of the weakest leaders in recent British history. EU diplomats and officials expressed astonishment about the uncertainty in London.  Supporters, including her most senior ministers, said she should remain in charge to deliver Brexit.     Under the headline  Theresa May will stay as Prime Minister and get the job done,  interior minister Amber Rudd wrote in The Telegraph newspaper that  she should stay . May s de facto deputy Damian Green said she would carry on. Environment Secretary Michael Gove also said he hoped she would continue.  I know that she is as determined as ever to get on with the job, she sees it as her duty to do so and she will carry on and she will make a success of this government,  Green, the first secretary of state, told BBC television. Many Conservative activists fear a leadership contest would exacerbate the divide in the party over Europe, an issue that helped sink the previous three Conservative prime ministers - David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher. A leadership contest could also pave the way for an election that some Conservatives worry could be won by Corbyn, whom they cast as a Marxist who would reverse decades of free market policies.  The Conservatives have no plan for Britain and their posturing will not deliver the change our country is crying out for,  Corbyn said on Friday. ",

        "title": "Trump's post-Orlando message falls flat with Republican establishment",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The mass shooting in Orlando, Florida has allowed Donald Trump to seize upon a familiar issue he has used to great advantage -the threat of Islamist militants and his plan to limit Muslim immigration to the United States, offering him what could be a crucial moment to re-boot his sputtering presidential campaign.  But while rank-and-file voters might respond positively to Trump\u2019s renewed call for a ban on some Muslims entering the country, his reaction to the massacre showed few initial signs of winning over Republican foreign-policy figures who have spurned the New York mogul. \u201cIt\u2019s a missed opportunity to present a different image,\u201d said Peter Feaver, a top National Security Council aide in the George W. Bush White House. \u201cHe has doubled down on policies I oppose and that aren\u2019t going to solve the problem.\u201d Trump said in a speech Monday in New Hampshire he would suspend immigration from countries \u201cwhere there is a proven history of terrorism\u201d against the United States. He said radical Muslim immigrants were \u201ctrying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS (Islamic State) is.\u201d After the worst mass murder in modern U.S. history on Sunday left 50 dead, Trump\u2019s speech was hastily refashioned from a broad critique of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton to a dire warning of the threat from Islamist militants. Although Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, U.S. officials have maintained that Omar Mateen\u2019s motives were unclear and that he had no known direct links with the Syria-based group. Mateen, they said, was likely radicalized over the Internet. A week ago, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee\u2019s bid was taking on water. He was being battered by fellow Republicans for his comments about the Hispanic heritage of a federal judge, and Clinton was pulling away in the polls. A renewed focus on national security could provide Trump with the chance to expand his appeal both to undecided voters and to the Republican foreign-policy establishment. While Trump at times seems to relish being at odds with the establishment, the unhappiness among the party\u2019s hawks isn\u2019t just a matter of hand-wringing. It means if Trump does reach the White House, he could have a difficult time recruiting talented, experienced advisers.  Max Boot, an influential conservative at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the Orlando tragedy \u201ccould have provided an opening for Trump to rally Republicans against terrorism.\u201d But instead, Boot said, Trump has been \u201cpartisan and petty.\u201d Boot criticized Trump for suggesting on Monday that President Barack Obama may sympathize with radicalized Muslims and for reviving the proposed Muslim ban. \u201cHis performance has been in character,\u201d Boot said, \u201cwhich is to say appalling.\u201d Trump has alarmed some mainstream Republicans with vows to shred international trade deals, his demands that Mexico pay for a border wall and his questioning of U.S. foreign policy pillars such as its security commitments to NATO and Asian allies.  Clinton struck a very different tone in a speech on Monday, urging \u201cstatesmanship, not partisanship\u201d and \u201cclear, rational discussion\u201d on how to protect the United States from terrorist threats. Eliot Cohen, a top-ranking State Department official during the Bush administration, called Trump\u2019s reaction to the shootings \u201copportunistic and shallow\u201d and \u201cnot what Americans expect from a president.\u201d   Lanhee Chen, a top aide to Mitt Romney during his 2012 presidential campaign, suggested Trump will not be able to refine his image. \u201cWhile it would be true in most cases a big speech like this could reset the decks, I think the challenge with Donald Trump is always who he is at his core,\u201d Chen said. But voters are another matter. Trump\u2019s swift rise within the Republican Party was at least partly due to the strident tone he has taken toward immigrants and refugees. When Trump responded to last year\u2019s terror attacks in Paris and California with a call for banning Muslims from entering the country, he surged in the Reuters/Ipsos poll in the weeks that followed, opening up a 30-point lead over his Republican primary rivals.  Republicans continue to be strongly supportive of Trump\u2019s approach to handling terrorism. This month, two-thirds of Republicans said they agreed with Trump\u2019s proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country.  Overall, 42 percent of Americans said they agreed with a Muslim ban while 50 percent said they disagreed, with another 8 percent not sure, according to another Reuters/Ipsos poll from May 17 to June 6. The poll of more than 6,000 people has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of about 1.5 percentage points. Combating Islamist extremism was on the mind of Texas billionaire Doug Deason, a major Republican donor who told Reuters he will meet with Trump later in the week to discuss his support.  Nothing Trump has said since the Orlando shooting has caused him to re-think backing him, Deason said.  Peter King, a U.S. congressman from New York, said his party\u2019s foreign-policy establishment will eventually have to get on board with Trump. \u201cAs one of the two major candidates for president, he will have to get advice or consultation with top national-security people,\u201d King said.

Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced Friday that the House will consider the Financial CHOICE Act in the coming days. The Republican majority is expected to pass the measure. But it faces an uncertain future in the Senate where Democrats are broadly opposed to the legislation and their votes are needed to pass it. \u201cThis is a jobs bill for Main Street.

The bill, authored by Representative Jeb Hensarling, would repeal large portions of Dodd-Frank, while placing significant new restrictions on financial regulators like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It would eliminate new powers granted to regulators after the crisis that allowed them to wind down failing institutions, and allow banks to be exempted from many existing financial rules if they agree to boost their capital reserves.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House advisers and Trump administration officials will meet on Thursday to discuss whether the United States should remain in the Paris climate agreement, a White House official said on Wednesday. The meeting, which will include member of the National Economic Council and cabinet officials such as Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, was scheduled for 1:30 P.M. EDT (1730 GMT) after being postponed earlier this month. The administration is expected to make a decision on whether to remain a party to the deal by the time leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy nations meet in late May, but members of President Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle are divided on whether to stay or go. The accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, would limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States under Trump\u2019s predecessor President Barack Obama committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. During the 2016 presidential election campaign Trump described climate change as a hoax that was stifling policies to improve economic growth and said he would consider \u201ccancelling\u201d the Paris agreement. He later said he was open to staying if the U.S. got better terms. Trump\u2019s advisers have taken different positions on the decision.  Pruitt joins Trump adviser Steve Bannon in opposing the Paris agreement. Trump\u2019s other close advisers, daughter Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner have sided with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who said the U.S. should remain part of the agreement. Perry has said it would be best to remain but renegotiate the terms.  George David Banks, in charge of international energy issues at the White House National Economic Council, has been receiving feedback from publicly traded coal and oil companies on the Paris decision. Some major coal companies, including Cloud Peak Energy , have said it would be in their company\u2019s global interest for the U.S. to stay in the pact. [L5N1HC5NC] Meanwhile, other global companies, ranging from BP to Microsoft to General Mills to Walmart sent a letter to Trump on Wednesday urging the president to keep the U.S. in the agreement to protect their competitiveness.

        "title": "Battered Puerto Rico hospitals on life support after Hurricane Maria",
        "text": "SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO (Reuters) - Puerto Rico s medical services are in critical condition in the wake of Hurricane Maria. The strongest storm to hit the island in decades has left hospitals flooded, strewn with rubble and dependent on diesel generators to keep the neediest patients alive. The precarious shape of the island s medical facilities is adding to the misery and devastation of this U.S. territory, whose 3.4 million residents are American citizens. For some, the only option is to evacuate to the United States for treatment. Among them is Cheira Ruiz and her baby girl Gabriellyz, who was born two weeks ago with a serious heart defect. The newborn was admitted to the Centro Cardiovascular de Puerto Rico in the capital shortly before Maria slammed into the island last Wednesday, but it was impossible for doctors to operate in such precarious conditions. Gabriellyz was among the first infants cleared to take a medical flight out of Puerto Rico since the storm. Her parents, who live two hours south of the capital, found out the good news Friday when emergency officials knocked on their door in the town of Guanica and told them to pack for the trip to Miami. With phone service out, the doctors had called one of the island s radio stations, which broadcast their plea for help in locating the couple. Hours before the flight was scheduled to depart, the parents learned there was only room for one of them. Mother and baby would fly alone to Miami.  I m trying to be strong,  Ruiz said on Saturday. In the days since the storm, the island s residents have awakened to an altered reality. Food is in short supply. The island s electrical grid is down and may remain so for months. Motorists and pedestrians queue for blocks trying to secure scarce fuel to power vehicles and generators. Cellular service, internet, and email have virtually disappeared, hurling a modern society into a bygone era; radio has become a primary source of information. For hospitals across this region, the challenges are mounting. After the power went out, back-up generators at some hospitals failed quickly. Other hospitals are running critically low on diesel. Fuel is so precious that deliveries are made by armed guards to prevent looting, according to Dr. Ivan Gonzalez Cancel, a cardiovascular surgeon and director of the heart transplant program at Centro Cardiovascular.  Another hospital wants to transfer two critical patients here because they don t have electricity,  Gonzalez Cancel said. We can t take them. We have the same problem.  Medical staffers are also running low on gasoline for their daily commutes to work. Puerto Ricans are queuing as long as seven hours at the island s few functioning filling stations.  Marilyn Rivera Morales, a nurse at the center, said she had enough petrol to drive to the hospital for two more days.  How will they keep coming here if they don t have gas?  Gonzalez Cancel wondered. Fuel is just the beginning. The cardiovascular center was  in shambles,  Gonzalez Cancel said. Without air conditioning, the walls of the operating room were dripping with condensation and floors were slippery, he said. Most patients had been discharged or evacuated to other facilities, but some patients remained because their families could not be reached by phone. On the sidewalk outside the cardiac center on Saturday, Jorge Rivera and his wife Dorca approached Gonzalez Cancel to ask about the woman s father, a patient still inside waiting for triple-bypass surgery. The couple are residents of Savannah, Georgia who were in Puerto Rico to care for their loved one. With the hospital scaling down operations and the island s infrastructure on its knees, Gonzalez Cancel estimated he would not perform another open heart surgery for a month or more. His advice to the couple: leave.  I am talking to you, not as a physician, I am talking to you as a human being,  he said.  Get him on a plane. You can be in Miami in two and a half hours.  But leaving is not simple. With the island s main airport still crippled, Gonzalez Cancel said he needed to secure a special waiver from authorities to obtain the medical evacuation flight for baby Gabriellyz. Travelers at the airport on Sunday were told that passengers who do not already have tickets may not be able to secure flights out until October 4. Officials here expect the situation at Puerto Rico s hospitals could worsen before it improves. At Centro Medico, the island s largest public hospital, the disaster medical assistance team of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is setting up makeshift hospital units.  I think this might be a calm before we see an influx as other hospitals lose generators,  said Commander Michael Garner, a regional coordinator for the effort. The devastation caused by Maria is similar to that wrought by hurricanes Katrina, Harvey and Irma. But Puerto Rico s remoteness, lack of communications and fragile infrastructure exacerbate the logistical challenges of recovery  on a very grand scale,  Garner said. U.S. Air Force Colonel Michael Valle, who arrived in Puerto Rico on Friday to help with recovery efforts, agreed.  To me, this is a lot worse, because you can t drive in from other states. Everything must come by boat or by air,  Valle said. Adding to the worries, a Puerto Rico dam damaged by heavy rains was in danger of failing on Sunday, posing a risk to communities along the rain-swollen Guajataca River. If the dam fails, the flooding would be life-threatening, the National Weather Service warned.  Stay away or be swept away,  it said. At least 10 people have died so far in Puerto Rico, where the humanitarian crisis is growing. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has been posting images on Twitter of U.S. responders on the ground in Puerto Rico, including the U.S. Coast Guard and FEMA search-and-rescue teams. But patience is starting to fray with the speed of the aid response.  We need a massive military response,  surgeon Gonzalez Cancel said.  Waiting for news about his father-in-law, Rivera, the Georgia resident and a 49-year-old Iraq War veteran, said the U.S. military could only do so much. He forecast the island would take months to get back on its feet.  You need God pretty much to fix every light bulb,  he said. Dr. Juan Carlos Sotomonte, the medical director of the Centro Medico s cardiovascular unit, said intervention   divine or otherwise   is needed fast.  If this is not taken care of, people are going to start dying,  he said.  ",

        "title": "Trump's opponents race to the courthouse to thwart him",
        "text": " WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump announced on Oct. 12 he would stop subsidies to health insurers critical to the Obamacare law, the response from Democratic state officials was swift and predictable: a lawsuit by 18 state attorneys general was filed within 24 hours.  The race to the courthouse in response to presidential actions has become a familiar pattern since Trump took office in January, and early rulings in many of the lawsuits have, at least temporarily, hobbled key parts of the president\u2019s agenda.  Many of the Republican president\u2019s most significant executive actions, in areas from immigration and transgender rights to energy and the environment, have been impeded by court rulings in cases brought by Democratic state and local officials as well as liberal advocacy groups.  \u201cWe are more of a check on this administration than Congress,\u201d Democratic New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said of state attorneys general.  Similarly, important executive actions taken by Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama were stymied by lawsuits filed by Republican state attorneys general, including one eventually decided by the Supreme Court that was intended to protect millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation.  Since Trump took office, courts have at least temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s plans to:  **ban travelers and immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries  **withhold\u00a0federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities on immigration enforcement  **ban transgender people from serving in the military  **delay implementation of a regulation issued by the Obama administration limiting methane emissions  **put the brakes on an Interior Department rule requiring energy firms to pay more mineral royalties on federal land  **delay compliance with an Obama-era rule aimed at curbing natural gas drilling waste emissions on federal land  **and impede a detained illegal immigrant teenager from obtaining an abortion  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trump has claimed some court victories, too, including on Oct. 25 when a federal judge in California refused the request by the state attorneys general to force the government to keep the subsidies to insurers under Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, in place as the litigation proceeds. That decision was more the exception than the rule.  \"President Trump remains committed to protecting our national security and to eliminating excessive regulations that, if implemented, would destroy jobs, harm consumers and provide no meaningful benefit,\" a White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said in a statement provided to Reuters. \"The Trump administration is confident in its legal positions and looks forward to arguing -- and winning -- before the federal judiciary,\" the official added.  In response to legal setbacks, Trump has lashed out at the judiciary in ways that even his own Supreme Court appointee Neil Gorsuch called disheartening and demoralizing. Trump called U.S. courts \u201cso political,\u201d labeled various rulings and proceedings \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d and disparaged\u00a0one jurist who ruled against him as a \u201cso-called judge.\u201d  While presidents often face legal challenges over policy initiatives, Trump\u2019s administration stands out for the number of suits it has encountered so soon after taking power.\u00a0  Trump has faced far more litigation than Obama had at this stage of his presidency. A review of legal database Westlaw showed that in Trump\u2019s first nine months in office, cities or states filed 24 lawsuits challenging major policy initiatives of the administration. The review showed no similar lawsuits during the same time period of Obama\u2019s presidency.  Trump also faces numerous suits by advocacy groups and others challenging such actions as his termination of an Obama program that protected people brought into the United States illegally as children from deportation and the authority of a presidential commission formed to investigate alleged voter fraud.  Trump has relied heavily on unilateral executive actions to advance his policy objectives. His fellow Republicans who control Congress have been unable to pass any major legislation he has sought.  Executive actions can be challenged in court more quickly than lengthy federal rule-making procedures, said law professor Jonathan Adler of Case Western Reserve University School of Law.  Obama relied on executive actions during the later years of his presidency after being unable to win congressional approval of key initiatives, and some of those actions drew legal challenges. But early in his presidency, he relied on unilateral actions less often because his fellow Democrats controlled Congress and passed major legislation including the 2010 Obamacare law.  Some legal experts say the haste with which Trump drafted some of his policy initiatives may have helped those challenging the actions because the orders were not sufficiently vetted.  \u201cThis administration is more willing to shoot from the hip\u201d when compared with the Obama administration, Adler said.  That is how San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera, a Democrat, saw Trump\u2019s\u00a0executive order on sanctuary city funding, which Herrera calculated could jeopardize up to $2 billion in federal funds for his city.  Herrera said he saw Trump\u2019s action as \u201cdesigned to appeal to a part of the administration\u2019s political base without really having been vetted\u201d by lawyers to ensure it was legally airtight. Herrera won an initial ruling in April blocking the measure, and the case is now pending before an appeals court.  Trump\u2019s actions have appealed to his conservative political base, while the legal challenges have pleased his liberal critics.  Speaking at an event at New York University, Schneiderman, New York\u2019s attorney general, called Trump\u2019s first travel ban, signed in January just a week into his presidency, a \u201cgalvanizing moment\u201d for Democratic officials.  While lawsuits challenging the president\u2019s actions have won some important early victories,\u00a0the litigation onslaught\u2019s ultimate effect on Trump\u2019s agenda is not yet clear.  Trump\u2019s opponents have tended to file suits in jurisdictions where they think they are likely to prevail, and where appeals will be heard in regional federal circuit courts dominated by Democratic-appointed judges.  The final decisions on the cases could be made by the Supreme Court, where Trump\u2019s appointment of Gorsuch restored a 5-4 conservative majority.  The high court is likely to \u201cprove more receptive\u201d to the administration\u2019s arguments on issues like immigration, said George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley.  Last week, a federal judge in San Francisco who was appointed by Obama appeared skeptical in a hearing about the challenge by the 18 states to the Affordable Care Act subsidies, illustrating the limits of resistance through litigation.  Alluding to the political aspect of the case, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria asked rhetorically during a hearing: why \u201chave all these attorneys general rushed to court seeking an emergency ruling against President Trump?\u201d Chhabria then ruled in favor of Trump.

Authorities have detained dozens of top Saudis including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in a move widely seen as an attempt by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to neuter any opposition to his lightning ascent to power.

Tensions have continued to rise since North Korea carried out its sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3, prompting a new round of U.N. sanctions. Wang told Japan Foreign Minister Taro Kono on the sidelines of a United Nations meeting in New York that the situation on the Korean peninsula was getting increasingly serious and all sides needed to remain calm. Resuming peace talks was just as much a part of the U.N. resolutions as enforcing sanctions, Wang said, according to a statement issued by China s Foreign Ministry late on Friday.  If the Japanese side only talks about sanctions and does not bring up talks, or even goes against talks, it will be seen as contravening Security Council resolutions,  the ministry cited Wang as saying. China hoped that Japan talked and acted cautiously and played a constructive role on the nuclear issue, he said. Beijing has repeatedly expressed concern about the rise of tensions over North Korea and, while it too has signed up for the increasingly tough U.N. sanctions, it has also urged a return to talks and for all parties to exercise restraint. On Friday, Russia urged  hot heads  to calm down as the United States admitted it felt  challenged  by North Korea s warning that it could test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific.

        "text": "GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Clashes between Congolese troops and supporters of a renegade colonel in Congo s eastern city of Bukavu killed seven people on Sunday before he surrendered and turned himself in to U.N. peacekeepers, the army said. Democratic Republic of Congo army spokesman for South Kivu province, Dieudonne Kasereka, said clashes had started after police came to disarm Colonel Abbas Kayonga, who was sacked on Thursday from his post overseeing anti-fraud efforts in local mines. Kayonga, a former rebel from a group that had been disarmed and integrated into the Congolese military, gave himself up at the local base for the U.N. mission to Congo.  He has just surrendered with 17 people at the base of the mission,  Kasereka said by telephone. Two army soldiers and three of Kanyonga s bodyguards were killed in the fighting and two civilians were killed by stray bullets, he said. Seventeen members of Kanyonga s force surrendered to U.N. troops and nine others were captured by the army, Kasereka said, adding that soldiers found about a dozen heavy weapons at Kanyonga s house. Security has been deteriorating across Congo since the end of last year, when President Joseph Kabila refused to step down despite his mandate expiring.  Surging militia violence in the east, which has for decades been a tinderbox of ethnic rivalries fueled by the region s mineral wealth, and in the formerly peaceful central Kasai region, have raised fears the country could slip back to the multi-faceted civil wars of the turn of the century.  Those wars killed hundreds of thousands directly in violence while millions of others are thought to have died from of hunger and disease.  South Kivu has rich deposits of gold, tin and coltan, used in mobile phones, which have long helped finance rebel groups and army officers. The national electoral commission was expected to announce a date for the election to replace Kabila later on Sunday. Last month, it said the election cannot take place until April 2019, raising fears of an escalation in militia violence and civil disturbances.  U.S. envoy Nikki Haley said during a visit to meet with Kabila last month that the vote must happen in 2018 or it will lose international support. ",

        "title": "Clamor for justice: Yugoslav court leaves global legacy",
        "text": "BELGRADE (Reuters) - When a court on the Dutch North Sea coast issues its final verdict this week, it will signal the end of an experiment that has reverberated around the world, from the killing fields of Rwanda to the CIA s secret cells in Europe. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), set up by the United Nations in 1993, marked the biggest leap in the field of international criminal law since the Allies tried the Nazis in Nuremberg. Created in answer to the worst war crimes in Europe since World War Two, it set a precedent of accountability that has since put the Khmer Rouge and Liberia s Charles Taylor in the dock and paved the way for a court with global ambition. Almost 25 years later, its legacy is under threat. The International Criminal Court (ICC), opened in 2002, is undermined by renewed West-Russia rivalry, stone-walling and revolt in Africa, barrel bombs in Syria and a boycott by three of five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. Supporters of the Yugoslav tribunal say it will remain a beacon inspiring a growing demand for justice and creativeness in delivering it   from ad hoc tribunals in Africa to the conviction in one country of a dictator from another and that of a Syrian in Sweden after a post on Facebook. The glass is either half full or half empty, said Alex Whiting, professor of practice at Harvard Law School.  You can say we haven t come far enough and the new institutions, particularly the ICC, have not replicated the success of the ICTY, but you can just as easily say it s remarkable how far we ve come in just 25 years,  he said.  The ICTY is the North Star.  The Yugoslav tribunal owes a debt to history, born as it was between the end of the Cold War and the 9/11 attacks on the United States, when Russia was weak and the West was united in collective action. For decades before, conflicts from Vietnam to Algeria, Afghanistan to Sri Lanka escaped major judicial scrutiny. Backed by the arrest-power of Western peacekeepers and the readiness of the European Union to condition integration with Yugoslavia s successor states on their cooperation, the tribunal issued 161 indictments and secured 83 convictions. Wednesday s verdict in the trial of Bosnian Serb wartime commander Ratko Mladic will be its last, bar appeals. The Yugoslav court was the first to indict a sitting head of state in Serbia s Slobodan Milosevic, recognized sexual violence as a crime of war and advanced the definition of genocide. With the U.N. tribunal for Rwanda, it assembled the hybrid case law used by tribunals in Sierra Leone, Cambodia, Lebanon and ultimately the ICC. Its 2.5 million pages of transcripts offer a forensic and often harrowing account of a state s dissolution that dispels the fog of wartime propaganda. More than 4,500 witnesses took the stand.  I committed myself to speak on behalf of those who did not survive,  said Nusreta Sivac, a former judge in Bosnia who testified to her rape by Bosnian Serb captors.  The tribunal rulings will write history.  Detractors say the court was slow, expensive and damaged by a number of high-profile acquittals. Milosevic died in 2006 while still on trial, while some cases were plagued by witness intimidation. The tribunal was supposed to help with reconciliation, but revisionism is rife and convicted war criminals often feted as heroes. Critics argue the indictment of Milosevic, at the height of NATO air strikes against him, only complicated the conflict and encouraged him to cling on, which he did for another 17 months. Similar arguments have been made against the ICC s pursuit of some African leaders. Established by treaty and boycotted by the United States, China and Russia, the ICC has little of the clout of the ICTY. With only one Arab member, it has found the bulk of its work in Africa. Alleging bias, Burundi quit the court last month. Kenya and South Africa have threatened to follow. The court s credibility has already been tested by the collapse in 2014 of a case against Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir s eight-year evasion of arrest. Most glaring is its impotence in the face of nearly half a million dead in Syria, its hands tied by Russian and Chinese vetoes in the Security Council, which can refer a case to the court in a non-member state such as Syria. The ICC denies any bias against Africa and is at various stages of investigation in Georgia, Iraq, Ukraine, Colombia and Palestine, though it can expect to make little progress in investigating conflicts involving Russia or the United States. In a watershed moment, prosecutors this month called for a formal investigation into war crimes in Afghanistan, including the mistreatment of detainees by U.S. forces in the country and at CIA  dark sites  in Poland, Romania and Lithuania. Experts say the move is symbolic of the court s ambition, but also of its limitations, given the unlikelihood of any cooperation from the Trump administration. The Yugoslav tribunal demonstrated that,  with strong political and diplomatic support from the international community, justice can be achieved , its chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz told Reuters.  But without that support, the obstacles can be almost insurmountable.  Kevin Jon Heller, law professor at the University of Amsterdam, said of the ICC:  I strongly doubt it is ever going to fulfill the aspirations of the people in the states that created it.  Nevertheless, demands for accountability are multiplying, along with avenues to pursue them. Experts point to the 2016 conviction of Chad ex-dictator, Hissene Habre, in a Senegalese court, the first time universal jurisdiction was used to prosecute the former ruler of one country by a court in another for human rights crimes. The same principle saw a Syrian soldier convicted by a Swedish court last month, partly on the basis of social media posts, while authorities in Sweden and Germany are each investigating more than a dozen individuals for crimes in Syria and Iraq. With the Security Council paralyzed, the U.N. General Assembly has launched its own ad hoc mechanism to investigate war crimes in Syria. A hybrid tribunal is in the works in Central African Republic and another mooted for South Sudan.  What has not ebbed in the last five to seven years, and in fact what has only increased, is the demand for justice, and an expectation that it will translate into action,  said Param-Preet Singh, an associate director at Human Rights Watch. The ICTY and efforts since have  changed the conversation , said Whiting.  It is for that reason this project will never die,  he said.  It will go into dormancy, but it will never die.  ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A leading U.S. conservative conference rescinded its invitation to provocative commentator Milo Yiannopoulos and a publisher canceled his book deal on Monday after old internet videos of him recirculated in which he discusses pedophilia. Yiannopoulos, in a Facebook video post, denied he ever condoned pedophilia and said one video of him was edited to give a misleading impression. Yiannopoulos, a Briton who is celebrated by some arch conservatives, was banned from Twitter last year after making highly controversial statements. He has infuriated liberals with provocative comments on race, religion and sex and appears to delight in his ability to offend.   The chairman of the American Conservative Union, which sponsors the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, said on Sunday the group rescinded an invitation to this year\u2019s Wednesday-Saturday event \u201cdue to the revelation of an offensive video in the past 24 hours condoning pedophilia.\u201d \u201cWe realize that Mr. Yiannopoulos has responded on Facebook, but it is insufficient,\u201d Matt Schlapp, chairman of the union, said in the Twitter post. CPAC is a high-profile annual gathering of conservative activists. President Donald Trump is among the scheduled speakers this year along with Vice President Mike Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior Trump adviser Stephen Bannon. Yiannopoulos is also an editor for the right-wing Breitbart News, which Bannon once headed.  Earlier this month, the University of California canceled Yiannopoulos\u2019 speaking engagement on the Berkeley campus when violent protests against his appearance broke out. Trump, in response, threatened on Twitter to cut off federal funding for the university. The latest controversy stems from a video in which Yiannopoulos seems to suggest the standard for pedophilia is whether the younger partner has gone through puberty. At another point in the video, however, Yiannopoulos says the established age of consent, which is 16 to 18 years old in the United States, is \u201cabout right.\u201d In his Facebook statement on Monday, Yiannopoulos denied condoning pedophilia. \u201cI find those crimes to be absolutely disgusting.

        "text": "HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China has quietly undertaken more construction and reclamation in the South China Sea, recent satellite images show, and is likely to more powerfully reassert its claims over the waterway soon, regional diplomats and military officers say. With global attention focused on North Korea and Beijing engrossed in its Party Congress, tensions in the South China Sea have slipped from the headlines in recent months.     But with none of the underlying disputes resolved and new images reviewed by Reuters showing China continuing to develop facilities on North and Tree islands in the contested Paracel islands, experts say the vital trade route remains a global flashpoint.          Some expect China to land its first deployments of jet fighters onto its runways in the Spratly islands in coming months, while regional military officers say it is already using the new facilities to expand naval and coast guard deployments deep into Southeast Asia.  They ve built these extensive facilities and both Chinese civilian and PLA experts have always made it clear that when the strategic time is right, they re going to start using them more fully,  said Bonnie Glaser, a China security expert at Washington s Center for Strategic and International Studies.  I think it is a question of when, rather than if, China will start to assert its interests more forcefully in the South China Sea ... and that is likely to be at a time of China s choosing,  Glaser told Reuters. Rival claimant Vietnam, meanwhile, is nearing completion of reclamations and an extended runway on its base on Spratly Island, the satellite images show. The build-up of the Spratlys symbolizes China s growing assertiveness over the South China Sea during President Xi Jinping s first term and was highlighted in his address to the Communist Party Congress this month.  Construction on islands and reefs in the South China Sea has seen steady progress,  Xi told the Congress. The issue is likely to come up during U.S. President Donald Trump s visit to Asia, which begins this week.  We remain concerned about tensions in the South China Sea, in particular those caused by land reclamation and militarization of disputed outposts and the willingness of some to resort to coercive tactics to assert their claims,  said Michael Cavey, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department.  We have consistently called on China, as well as other claimants, to refrain from any further land reclamation, construction of new facilities, and militarization of the disputed features.    Responding to Reuters  questions, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang reiterated the islands were irrefutably Chinese territory.  You can t say that the construction on our islands and reefs in the South China Sea and the building of necessary defensive facilities is an expansion of military deployments,  he said.  We believe that at present the situation in the South China Sea is generally good, and all relevant parties should work hard together to protect the peace and stability of the South China Sea.  China s ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, said on Monday the United States should not try to  interfere  in regional efforts to resolve disputes in the South China Sea.    For a graphic on Spratly Islands, click here China has been seeking to soothe fellow claimant the Philippines and accelerating talks with the wider ASEAN grouping, amid concerns in Washington about the long-term security of the waterway through which some $3 trillion in trade a year passes. In a speech in Singapore earlier this month, the most senior U.S. military chief in the region said even while Washington pushed Beijing for help on North Korea, it would still hold China accountable for actions that countered international rules and norms.  We also want Beijing to do more to stop provocative actions in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, where the Chinese are building up combat power and positional advantage in an attempt to assert de-facto sovereignty over disputed maritime features,  Admiral Harry Harris, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, said. China claims much of the area through its controversial nine-dash line, which overlaps rival maritime claims by Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei. A recent study by the U.S. government-linked RAND Corp weighing the risks of a conflict between the United States and China moved the South China Sea up its list of potential flashpoints. Placing it above Taiwan but below the Korean peninsula, the  study notes the waterway has  become the unanticipated focal point of U.S.-Chinese ... rivalry . While the Pentagon has embarked on more regular freedom-of-navigation patrols, or FONOPS, to challenge Beijing s claims, some analysts believe Washington is struggling to counter China s creeping domination of the area.  China appears to be pursuing a well-thought out and long-term strategy to achieve dominion over the South China Sea while America responds with ad hoc tactical maneuvers,  said Ian Storey, a South China Sea expert at Singapore s Yusof Ishak Institute.  FONOPS are tactics not strategy, and they have not made China rethink its plans for the South China Sea one iota.  Ni Lexiong, a naval expert at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said there was little need for China to dramatically increase deployments now, but much depended on the actions others.  As long as others don t intentionally go and provoke clashes, things will be fine,  he added.  The issue is that some countries, like the United States, go and stir things up.  ",

        "title": "Zimbabwe's ruling party to hold rally as anti-Mugabe tide rises",
        "text": "HARARE (Reuters) - President Robert Mugabe s own ruling ZANU-PF party wants him to step down and plans to hold a rally in Zimbabwe s capital Harare on Saturday to make the point. Mugabe, at Zimbabwe s helm since independence from Britain in 1980, faces the starkest challenge ever to his rule after the army seized power on Wednesday, saying it was targeting  criminals  around the nonagenarian leader. ZANU-PF called on Friday for Mugabe to resign, the main state newspaper The Herald reported, a clear sign that the aging leader s authority has collapsed after the army takeover. The newspaper said that ZANU-PF branches in all 10 provinces had met and had also called for Mugabe s wife Grace, whose ambitions to succeed her husband triggered the political crisis, to resign from the party.  A senior member of ZANU-PF earlier told Reuters the party wanted their long-time president gone.   If he becomes stubborn, we will arrange for him to be fired on Sunday,  the source said.  When that is done, it s impeachment on Tuesday.   The Herald reported that ZANU-PF would convene a special Central Committee meeting on Sunday to  realign the revolutionary party with current political developments . Pointedly, the military said it  fully supports  a  solidarity march  - apparently separate from the ZANU-PF event - in Harare on Saturday, part of an apparent groundswell of anti-Mugabe sentiment unleashed by the dramatic events of the past few days. The army said it had been  approached by several private volunteer organizations seeking to freely move and express their desires  and they could do so if they were orderly and peaceful.    Harare has been calm as the coup has unfolded but the armed forces also said in a statement that  people have been warned against looting .  The army appears to want Mugabe to go quietly and allow a transition to Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose sacking last week as vice president sparked the army action. A goal of the generals is to prevent Mugabe handing power to his wife, Grace, 41 years his junior, who appeared on the cusp of power after Mnangagwa was pushed out. Mugabe, 93, who calls himself the grand old man of African politics, looks to be running out of options. The army is camped on his doorstep. Grace Mugabe is under house arrest and her key political allies are in military custody.  All the main pillars of Mugabe s rule have turned on him or have offered no support.  The police have shown no resistance, while Chris Mutsvangwa, the leader of Zimbabwe s influential war veterans, said on Friday that Mugabe would not be allowed to resist the military and remain in power. And ZANU-PF, which built a cult of personality around its leader, has now deserted him. Mugabe is revered by some as an elder statesman and independence leader but also reviled by many in Africa and abroad who accuse him of resorting to violence to retain power while running a once promising economy into the ground. The economy collapsed after the seizure of white-owned farms in 2000. Unemployment is now running at nearly 90 percent and chronic shortages of hard currency have triggered inflation, with the prices of imports rising as much as 50 percent a month. ",

Lee, a community college teacher and pro-democracy and human rights activist, went missing during a March visit to China. Authorities later confirmed he had been detained, straining already-tense ties between the mainland and the self-ruling island. Authorities at the Intermediate People s Court of Yueyang city, in the central province of Hunan, said Monday s trial on suspicion of subversion of state power would be an open hearing. Chinese courts have video-streamed or live-blogged increasing numbers of proceedings in recent years as part of a push towards judicial transparency However, rights activists say that in sensitive cases, holding  open  hearings is a tool for authorities to demonstrate state power and that usually the defendant has agreed to an outcome. On Saturday, Lee s wife, Lee Ching-yu, asked during a news conference that supporters forgive her husband if he says something in court which disappoints them, as he might be required to give testimony against his own free will. On Sunday she declined to comment to a large media contingent as she checked into her flight at Taipei Songshan Airport, where she was to fly to Changsha, in Hunan province, via Shanghai.  Taiwan s Mainland Affairs Council said it would do everything in its power to facilitate Lee s safe return.  Our government s approach to this case has been predicated on preserving our country s dignity while ensuring Lee Ming-che s safety,  it said. Lee s case has strained relations between Taipei and Beijing, which have been particularly tense since President Tsai Ing-wen, leader of Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, took office last year. Beijing regards the island as a breakaway province and it has never renounced the use of force to bring it back under mainland control. ",

An Iranian court sentenced 46-year-old Siamak Namazi and his 80-year-old father Baquer Namazi to 10 years in prison each in October on charges of spying and cooperating with the United States. The Namazis\u2019 lawyer, Jared Genser, said he had traveled to the nuclear talks venue in Vienna with Siamak\u2019s brother, Babak, to encourage Washington\u2019s delegation to press the case, adding that he was worried about the detained men\u2019s health. The lawyer said a senior administration official in the U.S. delegation had told him on Monday that the case would be raised directly during the talks on the implementation of a deal reached in 2015 to shrink Iran\u2019s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.

The remarks were a blunt reminder of the gloom underscoring U.S. military assessments of the war between the U.S.-backed Afghan government and the Islamist militant group, classified by U.S. commanders as a \u201cstalemate\u201d despite almost 16 years of fighting. \u201cWe are not winning in Afghanistan right now. And we will correct this as soon as possible,\u201d Mattis said in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee. Mattis acknowledged that he believed the Taliban were \u201csurging\u201d at the moment, something he said he intended to address. Some U.S. officials questioned the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and more than 17,000 wounded since the war began in 2001.  The Afghan government was assessed by the U.S. military to control or influence just 59.7 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s 407 districts as of Feb. 20, a nearly 11 percentage-point decrease from the same time in 2016, according to data released by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. A truck bomb explosion in Kabul last month killed more than 150 people, making it the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital since the Taliban were ousted in 2001 by a NATO-led coalition after ruling the country for five years. On Saturday, three U.S. soldiers were killed when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them in eastern Afghanistan.  Reuters reported in late April that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump was carrying out a review of Afghanistan, and conversations were revolving around sending between 3,000 and 5,000 U.S. and coalition troops there. Deliberations include giving more authority to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters.  Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate committee, pressed Mattis on the deteriorating situation, saying the United States had an urgent need for \u201ca change in strategy, and an increase in resources if we are to turn the situation around.\u201d \u201cWe recognize the need for urgency,\u201d Mattis said.

        "text": "SHAH PORIR DWIP ISLAND, Bangladesh (Reuters) - On a remote beach looking out onto the Bay of Bengal, a baby boy lies swaddled in cloth, his face smeared with wet sand. The bodies of nine more children and eight women lie alongside. Another woman and a child have already been buried. The group, all Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, were found washed up on the shore on Thursday by villagers from Shah Porir Dwip island in Bangladesh, a short distance from the mouth of the Naf river that separates the two countries. They died after two rickety boats capsized as they fled a Myanmar army counteroffensive that followed Rohingya insurgent attacks on security forces last week. Nearly 30,000 more Rohingyas have made the perilous crossing by boat or on foot into Bangladesh, while 20,000 more are stuck in no man s land at the border.  We left after the army came early yesterday. They burned houses and shot many people. We ran away so they couldn t find us,  said Samira, 19, a survivor from one of the boats, as the monsoon wind and rain blew off the sea to soak her bright orange hijab.  I have no words. I don t know what we ll do.  Samira and others fled violence unleashed after Rohingya insurgents wielding sticks, knives and crude bombs attacked police posts and an army base on Friday, leading to clashes that have killed at least 117 people. Journalists and other outside observers have been unable to independently travel to the northwest of Myanmar s Rakhine state since an earlier outbreak of violence last year, although some aid programs had quietly been resumed. Myanmar says its army is conducting clearance operations against  extremist terrorists  and that security forces have been told to protect civilians, but Rohingya arriving in Bangladesh say a campaign is under way to force them out. The bodies washed up on Thursday were hardly the first Rohingya to perish trying to escape by boat from Myanmar. Many died trying to cross the Naf after smaller-scale insurgent attacks last October provoked a harsh military response. Over the years, tens of thousands have attempted to flee across the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea to Thailand and Malaysia. A crackdown on people smuggling networks in Thailand in 2015 saw many Rohingya abandoned at sea by traffickers. The disruption to the smuggling networks also cut off a major escape route for the Muslim minority, which is denied citizenship and endures apartheid-like conditions in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Samira s group hailed from a village to the south of the major regional town of Maungdaw in Rakhine. A Reuters reporter who traveled with government minders to the area on Wednesday saw many villages on fire. The two boats set off for the Bangladesh coast around 7 p.m. on Wednesday. The Naf here is about 3 km (1.9 miles) wide. After the group arrived on the Bangladeshi side, someone shouted that the police were near, Samira said. They went back out to sea - and a large wave tipped the boats over. Out of the 22 members of Samira s extended family six died.  My brother can swim so he managed to save some of us,  she said. In total, 14 people survived, but  young children and those women couldn t swim and they couldn t be saved,  she said, looking over the bodies lined up on the beach. The island - which used to be reachable by a bitumen road on a causeway - is about an hour by boat from Bangladesh s Teknaf peninsula. The road has been washed away by the Bay of Bengal s tides and strong winds. As the number of Rohingya refugees is expected to swell, humanitarian workers worry such boat accidents may become more frequent. Hundreds fleeing on boats were being pushed back by Bangladeshi border guards, according to authorities. The United Nations is pressuring Dhaka to let those fleeing Myanmar seek shelter on its territory, but Bangladesh - one of the poorest countries in Asia - has said it cannot cope with any more refugees and will not allow people to cross the border. Another boat in the area sank on Wednesday, killing two women and two children, after Myanmar border guards fired on it, Bangladesh Border Guard Lt. Col. Ariful Islam told Reuters.  One person survived by floating on a jerry can. Jahid Hussein Saddique, a local administrator, confirmed the Thursday accident took place and said that a broker has been sentenced to six months in jail by a mobile court for human trafficking.  They didn t know how to swim, so they died,  Saddique said. We don t know the actual cause of death.  ",

We need to cleanse Afrin of the structure there called the YPG terrorist organization,  Erdogan said. Turkey has long been angered at the United States  support for the YPG and Erdogan has repeatedly accused Washington of violating the alliance between the two countries.  We are greatly disappointed by the United States not keeping its promises. Many issues that we could have resolved easily...were pushed to a dead-end,  he said. Turkey has expressed displeasure at the U.S. stance toward a deal between the YPG and Islamic State under which hundreds of militants withdrew from the Syrian city of Raqqa before it fell to the Syrian Democratic Forces. Erdogan has previously said that Afrin would be on Ankara s agenda after its current operation in Syria s Idlib province, where Turkey and Russia have set up observation points under a  de-escalation  deal agreed by Ankara, Moscow and Tehran to ease the bloodshed in the six-year-old Syrian conflict. Erdogan said considerable progress had been made in Turkey s military operation in Idlib due to the co-operation of the three powers. Russia and Iran back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Turkey supports rebels opposing him, but all share a common foe in Islamic State. ",

        "title": "Congo used exiled rebels to suppress anti-Kabila protests: report",
        "text": "DAKAR (Reuters) - Congolese security officials recruited more than 200 exiled rebel fighters to help suppress protests against President Joseph Kabila a year ago, ordering them to use lethal force, Human Rights Watch said in a report on Monday. Security forces killed dozens during demonstrations in December 2016 when a delay to presidential elections and Kabila s refusal to step down sparked widespread unrest.  Kabila was required by the constitution to step down after an election to replace him in 2016 but the vote has been delayed until December 2018. Opposition leaders and activist groups have vowed fresh protests this month to try to force him from power. The HRW report was based on interviews with 13 fighters from the M23 rebel group who it says were recruited in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, M23 leaders and nine Congolese security and intelligence officials, most of whom were cited anonymously.  Congo s government spokesman declined to comment. Delphin Kahimbi, the head of Congo s military intelligence named in the report as one of the operation s coordinators, denied he recruited M23 fighters, calling the report s findings  ridiculous and absurd . M23 president Bertrand Bisimwa said in a statement on Monday that Congo had recruited deserters and others previously kicked out of the group but that M23 leadership was in no way involved. The M23 rose up against the government in eastern Congo in 2012 in one of a series of insurrections driven by disputes over ethnicity, land and resource rights that have cost millions of lives over the past two decades. The M23 was defeated by Congolese and U.N. troops in late 2013. The government subsequently promised amnesty for most of the hundreds of rebels who fled to neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, but the process has stalled. Congo s security services turned to M23 last year because Kabila did not trust his own security forces, the report said. Fighters were deployed to Kinshasa, Congo s second city Lubumbashi and the eastern city of Goma, integrated into police, army and presidential guard units. They were ordered to use lethal force against protesters, the report said. For their service, M23 members received hundreds of dollars each. Recruiters also warned they would lose all protection if Kabila left power. Richard Karemire, Uganda s military spokesman, denied M23 fighters were recruited in Uganda. Rwandan officials could not be immediately reached for comment.   ",

        "title": "Spain on the backfoot in bid to tackle youth unemployment",
        "text": "MADRID (Reuters) - Finding a fix for Spain s youth unemployment crisis was never going to happen overnight. But Spain took so long to jump on some of the help sent its way - namely a jobs scheme bankrolled by Europe - it risks not fully using a golden opportunity to help youngsters scarred by a deep recession, politicians, unions and jobseekers say. With nearly 40 percent of under-25s still out of work, youth unemployment remains the biggest blot on four years of economic recovery that have earned Spain a spot as one of the euro zone s star performers.  Yet a slow start to a European Union youth jobs and training program has left Spain racing to spend 1.9 billion euros ($2.24 billion) of EU funds as deadlines to use them up near, three years after the financing was first allocated. The sudden splurge has sparked accusations that the money is being wasted on ill-considered training courses and on job-seeker grants that may not induce firms to hire extra staff. Madrid even wants to use the funds as a form of salary top-up for poorly paid youths, though Brussels has questioned whether it complied with program guidelines and requested tweaks. Spain now appears on track to spend its allocation, but there remains a risk that Brussels will not reimburse all of it. To claim back funds from the EU, it is not enough for Madrid to just disburse cash; it must also show that courses and job placements have been completed by year-end deadlines. Madrid is confident that risk can be avoided, but some job-seekers and opposition politicians say the pace of spending in the meantime is becoming reckless and wasteful. Spain s Labour Ministry declined to comment for this story.   This has turned into something where the (EU) funds have to be spent come what may, without really looking at whether ... the measures are effective,  said Rocio de Frutos, a former labor inspector and lawmaker for the Socialists, the main opposition to Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy s People s Party. Environmental studies graduate Ricardo, 25, said the only courses available under the EU-backed program in his town of Segovia, in central Spain, were those he didn t need, like learning English, or were too basic, he said.  But he did several anyway to keep himself occupied.  It was completely useless. After going through this I just think this whole thing is a band-aid for a system that is completely sick,  said Ricardo, who declined to give his full name. Spain s approach to the EU scheme has also exposed broader structural flaws, critics say: a labor framework that is complicated to navigate, hampered by red tape and which offers little by way of tailored training or advice for job-seekers.   The stakes for Spain are high.   Amid fears that a  lost generation  will remain locked out of the labor market even as a financial and property crisis fade, anger has turned against politicians, in an echo of other countries stricken by high employment such as Greece. Spain was the biggest beneficiary of the EU s Youth Guarantee scheme, which EU leaders agreed on in 2013 and which was initially backed by 6.4 billion euros in funds to get young people into work. A Reuters review of spending data found Spain only distributed a tenth of its 1.9 billion euros allocation for the first 18 months, partly because it struggled to attract suitable recipients and to publicize the scheme through layers of national and regional government. The big spending push began in mid-2016, putting Spain on course to meet terms set by the EU to use up just over 1 billion euros of that allocation by end-2017. But it must spend and account for the remaining 900 million euros by end-2018. Stumbling blocks at a European level are partly to blame for delays to the scheme. States were supposed to give out their money first and then bill the EU - a tall order when Spain was under huge European pressure to slash its public deficit.  Spain did not present a single Youth Guarantee bill to the EU between 2014 and 2015, while France, Portugal and Italy had already begun doing so. A source at the ministry said that almost a year of political paralysis in 2016, following two inconclusive elections, had hindered any attempt to amend the Youth Guarantee scheme earlier because the government did not have full powers.  A European Commission official said Spain had made a slow start but the program was now going well there.  We see that joint efforts delivering the Youth Guarantee are now bearing fruit,  the official said.  Some of the scheme s users also praise its benefits. But early hiccups mean some potential jobs never materialized at a critical time, just as Spain was emerging from recession. For a graphic on Spanish youth unemployment, click: here ",

        "title": "Clinton's surprise Michigan loss exposes risks for her on trade",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s unexpected defeat in Michigan has laid bare growing voter anger over international trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible presidential election showdown against Republican front-runner Donald Trump. Trump has built his campaign on pledges to scrap international trade deals and do more to protect American workers from foreign competition, tapping the same groundswell of discontent that propelled Clinton\u2019s rival Bernie Sanders to victory in the Midwestern state on Tuesday. Clinton remains heavily favored to win the Democratic nomination. But the setback in Michigan could signal further troubles in upcoming primaries in other Rust Belt states such as Ohio, forcing her further to the left on economic issues and possibly influencing her choice for an eventual running mate, strategists said. The backlash against 20 years of trade liberalization has stalled the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a sweeping Pacific trade deal backed by President Barack Obama and threatens to stymie the trade agenda for years to come. \u201cIt\u2019s politically radioactive to support free trade right now,\u201d said Greg Valliere, a Washington analyst for Horizon Investments, a financial firm. Clinton\u2019s troubles with her party\u2019s left wing \u2014 and with white, working class voters more generally \u2014 may steer her toward a trade skeptic such as Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio as a vice presidential running mate, said Democratic strategist Steve Jarding. Political pundits had expected Clinton to pick someone to increase her appeal to Hispanic or other minority voters, such as U.S. Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro. Sanders, 74, is unlikely to end up as Clinton\u2019s running mate, partly due to his age, Democrats said. Both Sanders, a democratic socialist, and billionaire Trump have harnessed anti-trade sentiment in their insurgent White House bids, criticizing deals like NAFTA as job killers that have depressed the living standards of working Americans. Exit polls from Michigan, a hub of the U.S. auto industry, show widespread voter skepticism on trade that may have helped Sanders and Trump win their respective party primaries.  \u201cShe made a fundamental mistake early on in this campaign to try to stay in the center,\u201d Democratic strategist Steve Jarding said of Clinton. \u201cThis cycle, there is no center.\u201d Sanders campaigned heavily against foreign trade in a state that has been hammered by overseas competition since the 1980s. Some 58 percent of his supporters in Michigan exit polls said that trade takes away U.S. jobs, while a slight majority - 53 percent - of Clinton backers said trade creates U.S. jobs. The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, estimates that Michigan would lose 5 percent of its jobs if TPP were to take effect, the highest proportion of any state. Gary Hunley, a substitute teacher in Dearborn, Michigan, said he believed Clinton was partially to blame for stagnant wages because NAFTA was enacted under her husband Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency in the 1990s. \u201cShe was not a passive first lady,\u201d Hunley said. Clinton\u2019s stance on trade is more nuanced than Trump\u2019s and Sanders\u2019. After NAFTA was enacted, she voted against a free-trade deal with Central America while serving as a U.S. senator in the following decade. As Obama\u2019s secretary of state, Clinton helped negotiate the TPP with Japan, Vietnam and other Pacific Rim countries.  As a presidential candidate, Clinton has said after reading the final language of the deal she would vote against it because it does not adequately protect U.S. workers.  Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters Wednesday there were no plans to adjust her stance and that he would \u201cput Secretary Clinton up against any candidate in this race on trade,\u201d including Trump.  Despite backing by the Obama administration, Republican lawmakers and many business groups, Republican leaders in Congress have shown no sign that they will bring TPP up for a  vote this year. The Obama administration says the deal has high labor and environmental standards that were not part of NAFTA. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that has fully been absorbed in the public mindset,\u201d U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice told Reuters. [L1N16H1VJ] The deal may fare no better under the next president. Sanders and Trump oppose TPP, and Senator Ted Cruz, who is in second place in the Republican contest, has said he would not vote for it this year. \u201cThey\u2019ve listened to the public and politicians have caught up with the public on this,\u201d Brown, the Ohio Democratic senator, told Reuters. The evidence that the TPP would help the U.S. economy much is less than conclusive. The Peter G. Peterson Institute, a pro-trade think tank, estimates that it would boost economic growth by just 0.5 percent after 15 years. The deal would not boost employment overall, but would result in a \u201cchurn\u201d of 53,700 jobs lost and created each year, and it would boost incomes by 0.5 percent, the institute found.  Another estimate by the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University found the trade deal would slow growth by 0.54 percent after 10 years and cost 448,000 jobs in the United States.

        "title": "Trump backtracks on cyber unit with Russia after harsh criticism",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday backtracked on his push for a cyber security unit with Russia, tweeting that he did not think it could happen, hours after his proposal was harshly criticized by Republicans who said Moscow could not be trusted. Trump said on Twitter early on Sunday that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed on Friday forming \u201can impenetrable Cyber Security unit\u201d to address issues like the risk of cyber meddling in elections. The idea appeared to be a political non-starter. It was immediately scorned by several of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, who questioned why the United States would work with Russia after Moscow\u2019s alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. \u201cIt\u2019s not the dumbest idea I have ever heard but it\u2019s pretty close,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d program.  Ash Carter, who was U.S. defense secretary until the end of former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in January, told CNN flatly: \u201cThis is like the guy who robbed your house proposing a working group on burglary.\u201d Trump\u2019s advisers, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, had recently sought to explain Trump\u2019s cyber push. Mnuchin said on Saturday that Trump and Putin had agreed to create \u201ca cyber unit to make sure that there was absolutely no interference whatsoever, that they would work on cyber security together.\u201d But Trump returned to Twitter on Sunday to play down the idea, which arose at his talks with Putin at a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Hamburg, Germany.  \u201cThe fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn\u2019t mean I think it can happen. It can\u2019t,\u201d  Trump said on Twitter.  He then noted that an agreement with Russia for a ceasefire in Syria \u201ccan & did\u201d happen. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona acknowledged Trump\u2019s desire to move forward with Russia, but added: \u201cThere has to be a price to pay.\u201d \u201cThere has been no penalty,\u201d McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d program according to a CBS transcript. \u201cVladimir Putin ... got away with literally trying to change the outcome ... of our election.\u201d Trump argued for a rapprochement with Moscow in his campaign but has been unable to deliver because his administration has been dogged by investigations into the allegations of Russian interference in the election and ties with his campaign. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the matter, including whether there may have been any collusion on the part of Trump campaign officials, as are congressional committees including both the House of Representatives and Senate intelligence panels. Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscow\u2019s actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials say, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries despite Trump\u2019s suggestion that others could have been involved. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d program that Russia could not be a credible partner in a cyber security unit. \u201cIf that\u2019s our best election defense, we might as well just mail our ballot boxes to Moscow,\u201d Schiff added. Separately, U.S. government officials said a recent hack into business systems of U.S. nuclear power and other energy companies was carried out by Russian government hackers, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. Trump said he \u201cstrongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it.\u201d He added: \u201cWe negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!\u201d In Trump\u2019s first attempt at ending the six-year Syrian civil war, the United States, Russia and Jordan on Friday reached a ceasefire and \u201cde-escalation agreement\u201d for southwestern Syria. The ceasefire was holding hours after it took effect on Sunday, a monitor and two rebel officials said.     Any joint U.S.-Russia cyber initiative would have been a different matter. Depending how much it veered into military or espionage operations, it could have faced major legal hurdles. Language in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits the Pentagon, which includes the National Security Agency and the U.S. military\u2019s Cyber Command, from using any funds for bilateral military cooperation with Russia. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, also noted restrictions on sharing information with Russia that would clearly prohibit offering Moscow a sense of U.S. cyber capabilities. Russia would be similarly adverse to revealing its capabilities to the United States, he noted. \u201cIt just will not happen,\u201d McFaul told Reuters.  ",

        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Home improvement retailers Home Depot Inc and Lowe s Inc said on Wednesday they have started shipping emergency material to Florida in anticipation of Hurricane Irma, even as they continue recovery efforts after Hurricane Harvey in Texas. Irma, which hit the Caribbean island of St. Martin on Wednesday, is expected to make landfall in Florida during the weekend but its precise trajectory remained uncertain. Irma could become the second powerful storm to thrash the U.S. mainland after Harvey killed more than 60 people and caused as much as $180 billion in damage after hitting Texas late last month.  This is unusual because we are now juggling two different storms in two different phases. One is approaching while the other market is in the recovery phase,  Home Depot spokesman Matthew Harrigan told Reuters. Home Depot is following the  same script  preparing for Irma as it did for Harvey. The retailer s merchandising and supply chain teams have previously dealt with different weather-related disasters at once, Harrigan said without giving specific examples. Before Harvey hit Texas, the world s largest hardware and home improvement chain activated its disaster-response plan, asked managers to freeze prices in stores around the region and move storm related merchandise to the front of the store. It followed a plan honed over many hurricane seasons to minimize disruptions, deliver essential material to affected areas and capitalize on a surge in demand for products once repairs begin. Home Depot said it takes up to two months to open stores that are hit hard by a hurricane. Stores that are minimally impacted are usually opened within a few days. Both Home Depot and Lowe s had activated a hurricane command center during Harvey that is now continuing to monitor the path of Irma and mobilizing resources such as supplies. Home Depot said it has despatched 300 truckloads to Florida so far. Rival Lowe s said it has sent 400 truckloads of hurricane prep material including flashlights, batteries and weather radios to Florida. Analysts have said investments in logistics and supply chain by home improvement chains during a weather-related disaster typically brings about 10 to 15 times more in sales. Shares of both Home Depot and Lowe s traded up nearly 2 percent on Wednesday morning. ",

        "title": "Factbox: Trump fills top jobs for his administration",
        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will name former Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue as his nominee for secretary of agriculture on Thursday, a senior transition official said on Wednesday. Here is a list of Republican Trump\u2019s selections for top jobs in his administration.  NOTE: Senate confirmation is required for all the posts except national security adviser and White House posts. Tillerson, 64, has spent his entire career at Exxon Mobil Corp, where he rose to chairman and chief executive officer in 2006. A civil engineer by training, the Texan joined the world\u2019s largest publicly traded energy company in 1975 and led several of its operations in the United States as well as in Yemen, Thailand and Russia. As Exxon\u2019s chief executive, he maintained close ties with Moscow and opposed U.S. sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Crimea. Mnuchin, 54, is a successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc before leaving the investment bank in 2002. He assembled an investor group to buy a failed California mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as OneWest Bank and built it into Southern California\u2019s largest bank. Housing advocacy groups criticized OneWest for its foreclosure practices, accusing it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Mattis is a retired Marine general known for his tough talk, distrust of Iran and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. A former leader of Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, Mattis, 66, is known by many U.S. forces by his nickname, \u201cMad Dog.\u201d He was rebuked in 2005 for saying: \u201cIt\u2019s fun to shoot some people.\u201d Sessions, 70, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump\u2019s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. Son of a country store owner, the lawmaker from Alabama and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Coats, 73, served as U.S. senator from Indiana from 1989 to 1999 and again from 2011 to 2017, and was U.S. ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005. He previously served as U.S. representative from Indiana\u2019s 4th Congressional District. Zinke, 55, a first-term Republican U.S. representative from Montana and a member of the House subcommittee on natural resources, has voted for legislation that would weaken environmental safeguards on public lands. He has taken stances favoring the coal industry, which suffered during the Obama administration. The League of Conservation Voters, which ranks lawmakers on their environmental record, gave Zinke an extremely low lifetime score of 3 percent. Ross, 79, heads the private equity firm WL Ross & Co. Forbes has pegged his net worth at about $2.9 billion. A staunch supporter of Trump, Ross helped shape the Trump campaign\u2019s views on trade policy. He blames massive U.S. factory job losses on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico, which went into force in 1994, and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization.      Lighthizer, 69, served as deputy U.S. trade representative during the Reagan administration in the 1980s and has since spent nearly three decades as a lawyer representing U.S. companies in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases, currently with the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom. A harsh critic of China\u2019s trade practices, Lighthizer in 2010 told Congress that U.S. policymakers should take a more aggressive approach in dealing with the Asian country. Puzder, chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc [APOLOT.UL], which runs the Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s fast-food chains, has been a vociferous critic of government regulation of the workplace and the National Labor Relations Board. Puzder, 66, has argued that higher minimum wages would hurt workers by forcing restaurants to close and praises the benefits of automation, so his appointment is likely to antagonize organized labor.  U.S. Representative Price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House Budget Committee. A representative from Georgia since 2005, Price has criticized Obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. He is against abortion. Former Georgia Governor Perdue, 70, served on Trump\u2019s agricultural advisory committee during the campaign. Perdue, a Republican, was elected to two terms as governor, serving from 2003 to 2011. Before that, he served in the state Senate representing a rural swath of the state about 100 miles (160 km) south of Atlanta. After finishing his second term as governor, Perdue founded Perdue Partners, a global trading firm that consults and provides services for companies looking to export products. Shulkin, 57, currently is under secretary for health at the Department of Veterans Affairs, putting him in charge of the country\u2019s largest healthcare system. Shulkin, a physician, was chosen by Democratic President Barack Obama for the under secretary post in 2015. He has spearheaded an effort to cut waiting times for care at VA medical centers. Trump promised during the campaign to improve medical care for veterans. Shulkin would be the first VA secretary who had not served in the military. Carson, 65, is a retired neurosurgeon who dropped out of the Republican presidential nominating race in March and threw his support to Trump. A popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, Carson had been reluctant to take a position in the incoming administration because of his lack of experience in the federal government. He is the first African-American picked for a Cabinet spot by Trump. Chao, 63, was labor secretary under President George W. Bush for eight years and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. She is a director at Ingersoll Rand Plc, News Corp and Vulcan Materials Co. She is married to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky. Perry, 66, is an addition to the list of oil drilling advocates skeptical about climate change who have been picked for senior positions in Trump\u2019s Cabinet. The selections have worried environmentalists but cheered an oil and gas industry eager for expansion. Perry, who ran unsuccessfully for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination and also briefly ran for president in 2016, would be responsible for U.S. energy policy and oversee the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons program.  DeVos, 59, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for expansion of charter schools. The final leadership role of Kelly\u2019s 45-year military career was head of the U.S. Southern Command, responsible for U.S. military activities and relationships in Latin America and the Caribbean. The 66-year-old retired Marine general differed with Obama on key issues and has warned of vulnerabilities along the United States\u2019 southern border with Mexico. Priebus recently was re-elected to serve as Republican National Committee chairman but will give up that job to join Trump in the White House, where the low-key Washington operative could help forge ties with Congress to advance Trump\u2019s agenda. Priebus, 44, was a steadfast supporter of Trump during the presidential campaign even as the party fractured amid the choice. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ADMINISTRATOR: SCOTT PRUITT An ardent opponent of Obama\u2019s measures to stem climate change, Oklahoma Attorney General Pruitt, 48, has enraged environmental activists. But he fits in with the president-elect\u2019s promise to cut the agency back and eliminate regulation that he says is stifling oil and gas drilling. Pruitt became the top state prosecutor for Oklahoma, which has extensive oil reserves, in 2011 and has challenged the EPA multiple times since. U.S. Representative Mick Mulvaney, 49, a South Carolina Republican, is a fiscal conservative. He was an outspoken critic of former House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, who resigned in 2015 amid opposition from fellow Republicans who were members of the House Freedom Caucus. Mulvaney was first elected to Congress in 2010. Haley, 44, has been the Republican governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. The daughter of Indian immigrants, she led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman. McMahon, 68, is a co-founder and former chief executive of the professional wrestling franchise WWE, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut. She ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for a U.S. Senate seat in Connecticut in 2010 and 2012 and was an early supporter of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. U.S. Representative Pompeo, 53, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. government\u2019s sweeping collection of Americans\u2019 communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran. Walter \u201cJay\u201d Clayton is a New York-based attorney who advises clients on major Wall Street deals, specializing in public and private mergers and acquisitions and capital-raising efforts. His past clients have included Alibaba Group Holding Company, Oaktree Capital Group and big banks.    Retired Lieutenant General Flynn, 58, was an early Trump supporter and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his Army career in 1981 and was deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under Obama but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obama\u2019s foreign policy. Tom Bossert, 41, who worked as deputy homeland security adviser to former President George W. Bush, will serve as the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism. He currently runs a risk management consulting firm and has a cyber risk fellowship with the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. Cohn, 56, president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, had widely been considered heir apparent to Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of the Wall Street firm. Trump hammered Goldman and Blankfein during the presidential campaign, releasing a television ad that called Blankfein part of a \u201cglobal power structure\u201d that had robbed America\u2019s working class. Navarro, 67, has suggested a stepped-up engagement with Taiwan, including assistance with a submarine development program. A professor at the University of California, Irvine, who advised Trump during the campaign, Navarro argued that Washington should stop referring to the \u201cone China\u201d policy, but stopped short of suggesting it should recognize Taipei: \u201cThere is no need to unnecessarily poke the Panda.\u201d Viola, 60, is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a U.S. Army veteran who served in the famed 101st Airborne Division. He founded high-frequency trading firm Virtu Financial Inc and served as chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where he began his financial services career. After the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, Viola helped found the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. He is an owner of the Florida Panthers ice hockey team. CHIEF WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST, SENIOR COUNSELOR: STEVE BANNON The former head of the conservative website Breitbart News came aboard as Trump\u2019s campaign chairman in August. A rabble-rousing conservative media figure, he helped shift Breitbart into a forum for the alt-right, a loose confederation of those who reject mainstream politics and includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. His hiring signals Trump\u2019s dedication to operating outside the norms of Washington. As White House chief of staff, Bannon, 63, will serve as Trump\u2019s gatekeeper and agenda-setter. ",

        "title": "Eyeing national vote, Berlusconi celebrates win for center right in Sicily",
        "text": "PALERMO, Italy (Reuters) - Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi looked poised on Monday for a stunning political comeback as his rightist bloc claimed victory in an election in Sicily that puts it in pole position for a national vote due by next May. The regional Sicilian ballot, held on Sunday, was seen as a dry run for the nationwide election, with many of the island s problems reflecting those of the country as a whole - high unemployment, a debt mountain and sluggish economic growth. An influx of migrants, many of whom arrive in Sicily after being rescued in the Mediterranean, was also a key issue. With all of the votes counted, a center-right bloc backed by the four-times prime minister was more than 5 percentage points ahead of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, with the center left, which governs at the national level, a distant third.  Sicily, just as I asked, has chosen the path of real, serious, constructive change, based on honesty, competence and experience,  the 81-year-old said in a video posted on Facebook. Nello Musumeci, the center right s candidate for governor of the island, had 39.8 percent of the vote, while the 5-Star s Giancarlo Cancelleri had 34.7 percent. The center left s Fabrizio Micari was lagging on 18.7 percent. The result puts Berlusconi back on the political map after years of sex scandals and graft allegations which had seemed to have reduced the billionaire media mogul to a spent force. Berlusconi cannot run for office due to a 2013 tax fraud conviction. But he hopes the European Court of Human Rights overturns this ban when it reviews his case later this year,  which would pave the way for a possible national challenge. He returned to the fray after open-heart surgery last year and campaigned actively in Sicily. Even if the courts deny him the chance to run, he would be an influential figure should the center right capture power again nationally. The result on the island deals a stinging blow to another former prime minister, Matteo Renzi, head of the ruling Democratic Party (PD), which is locked in feuding with erstwhile leftist partners. After a raft of vote setbacks in recent years, Renzi has many critics inside the PD who may now try to mount a challenge to his leadership.  Defiant in its defeat, the anti-system 5-Star Movement vowed to reach national government next year, and its leader Luigi Di Maio declared the PD  politically dead . Opinion polls suggest the center right will win next year s national vote, but a recent change to the electoral law is likely to stop any one bloc winning an absolute majority of seats, resulting in political gridlock. Sicily is traditionally a center-right stronghold which was poached by the PD in 2012 thanks to splits in the conservative bloc. This time, Berlusconi reunited the coalition behind a widely respected leader with a far-right background. Berlusconi s allies, the Brothers of Italy and the Northern League, reaped rewards with anti-immigrant campaigns, suggesting this will remain high on the agenda for the national vote.  From Sicily we will demonstrate that this is a winning model that can triumph at a national level,  said Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the right-wing Brothers of Italy party which is the junior partner in the center-right alliance. The centre-left government has moved this year to shut down the flow of migrants from Libya after more than 600,000, mainly Africans, reached Italy over the past four years. But the issue has dented support for the center left, which has further damaged itself by falling prey to ferocious schisms. The maverick 5-Star, founded by comedian Beppe Grillo, had campaigned relentlessly for months in Sicily, looking to take charge of its first region after a string of successes in municipal ballots in recent years, including in Rome and Turin. Di Maio said the party had been penalized in Sicily by low turnout - a record of fewer than half of those eligible cast a vote, showing flagging interest in politics in Italy following years of economic downturn.  In two or three months I think many of those who abstained will regret not going to vote,  Di Maio said, insisting that if turnout had been 3 or 4 points higher it could have tilted the result in the movement s favor. Despite losing to the center right, the 5-Star Movement s result was a leap from 2012, when its candidate won only 18 percent of the vote in the regional polls.   Investors are worried 5-Star might win control of the country. The party bases its appeal mainly on a campaign against corruption and vested interests in Italy, but it has pulled back from a pledge to hold a referendum on continued membership of the euro. Markets were little changed on Monday. ",

        "title": "Incoming New Zealand government to review central bank objectives",
        "text": "WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand s new government plans to review and reform the Central Bank Act to possibly include employment, alongside inflation, as a dual target, Labour Prime Minister-elect Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday. The populist New Zealand First, the junior partner in the new Labour-led coalition government, also wants to broaden the central bank s focus to include greater management of the local dollar s value against other currencies.  We have been looking at changing the objectives set out in the Reserve Bank Act,  Ardern told reporters in Wellington.  The objectives of the Act to possibly include employment is certainly part of our plans.  Labour flagged the monetary policy changes during its election campaign. New Zealand First has previously mentioned it would like the central bank to better manage the currency, without elaborating.  The New Zealand dollar suffered fresh falls on Tuesday as Ardern and New Zealand First leader Winston Peters confirmed their policy priorities. The kiwi dollar shed all its early gains to push below $0.6940, having briefly been as high as $0.7003 at one point. Rather than just focussing on inflation, Labour wants the Reserve Bank to have a full employment goal when devising policy settings, bringing it into line with the United States and Australia.  While unemployment in New Zealand is at near decade lows of below 5 percent, job growth was a hot political issue during the recent election. The unlikely alliance between the centre-left Labour and populist New Zealand First was brokered after a Sept. 23 election failed to deliver a majority to the governing National or opposition Labour.  Peters has been offered the role of deputy prime minister, which he is likely to accept, and Ardern indicated on Tuesday that Peters would also become foreign minister, putting a protectionist at the forefront of New Zealand s international relations. Peters was foreign minister in a Labour-led government in 2005, during which time he became among a handful of Western politicians to visit North Korea.   The general consensus is that he did a good job,  said Richard Shaw, politics professor at Massey University.  He wasn t particularly interested in restructuring departments. He s very good at working the room and is an affable character.  Labour and New Zealand First share similar policies designed to cut immigration, ban foreigners from buying existing property and raise the minimum wage. Many of the policies draw on voter concerns that immigration and foreign buyers of local homes are putting too much pressure on infrastructure and house prices, representing a shift in New Zealand s formerly open door policy.  Ardern said Labour s immigration policy remained in place, whereby net migration would reduce from by between 20,000 to 30,000. This represents a less dramatic cut than New Zealand First had proposed prior to the election. Net migration is running at just over 70,000 a year. While a  confidence and supply  agreement with the Greens is delivering policies across the political spectrum, such as a push to legalise cannabis for personal use. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a letter on Saturday that he will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday to address matters former FBI Director James Comey brought up this week in testimony to the same panel. In a letter seen by Reuters, Sessions told Senator Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, that the intelligence committee is the \u201cmost appropriate\u201d place to address matters that came up during Comey\u2019s hearing on Thursday. The letter did not say whether Sessions planned to give public testimony or to appear before the panel behind closed doors. \u201cIn light of reports regarding Mr. Comey\u2019s recent testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, it is important that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum,\u201d Sessions said in the letter. The committee \u201cis the most appropriate forum for such matters, as it has been conducting an investigation and has access to relevant, classified information,\u201d he added. The Senate panel is investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In March, Sessions removed himself from any probe into alleged Russian meddling in the elections, but maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose that he met last year with Russia\u2019s ambassador. In testimony to the Senate panel on Thursday, Comey accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine the FBI\u2019s investigation of possible collusion by people in Trump\u2019s campaign with Russia\u2019s alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Comey\u2019s appearance raised new questions about the attorney general\u2019s relationship with Russian officials and others with ties to President Vladimir Putin. One question is whether Sessions had any undisclosed meetings with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak or other Russians during the campaign or after Trump\u2019s inauguration. In the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years, Comey told lawmakers the Trump administration had lied and defamed him and the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the president dismissed him on May 9. Sessions had planned to appear before the Senate and House Appropriations Subcommittees, but the deputy attorney general will take his place, the letter said. ",

        "title": "France gets serious over sexual harassment after Weinstein scandal: minister",
        "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - The Harvey Weinstein scandal is forcing a rethink of attitudes toward sexual harassment in France, a country that cherishes its self-image as the land of seduction and romance, said the minister tasked with cracking down on violence against women. Movie producer Weinstein has been accused by numerous women of having sexually harassed or assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1980s, including three who said they were raped. Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone. More than 300,000 accounts of sexual harassment or abuse have been published under the French #balancetonporc or #squealonyourpig hashtag on Twitter in the past week, though some conservatives say the new trend amounts to an attack on the French way of life in the name of U.S.-style puritanism.  We are really at a turning point, with the Weinstein affair as a trigger,  Gender Equality Minister Marlene Schiappa told Reuters on Friday in an interview. France has often debated sexual harassment over the past decade following scandals involving French politicians. Six years ago, a sex scandal forced former French finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn to resign as head of the International Monetary Fund, provoking a round of soul-searching in France about sexual abuse that goes undeclared or undetected in the upper echelons of power. A deputy of Macron s year-old Republic on the Move party (LREM), Christophe Arend, was accused by his ex-assistant and campaign manager of sexual harassment, the Franceinfo media outlet reported on Friday. The party said in a statement that Arend benefitted from a presumption of innocence until proven otherwise and that he had filed a complaint of  slanderous denunciation  against his accuser.  Any form of violence and harassment is intolerable. It is up to the justice (process) and it alone to shed light,  LREM said. Gender Equality Minister Schiappa said the Weinstein scandal could have a more durable impact in France because it had prompted women from all walks of life to denounce harassment and assault at work and in public places, not only in the corridors of power.  When it s about politicians, most people just slam politicians rather than seeing it as a wider issue,  said Schiappa, a 34-year-old blogger-turned-minister in President Emmanuel Macron s new government.  But when it s to do with cinema it has a wider impact, because ... people identify with actors and actresses,  she added, describing the wave of testimonies on social media as a  liberation . This week Schiappa kicked off nationwide consultations over a law due to be completed early next year that will include steps to fight sexual harassment on the streets as well as extend the statute of limitation for rape of minors. Not all French people approve of her plans or of the  #squealonyourpig trend on Twitter.  France is a country of men who love women  wrote pundits Berenice Levet and Guillaume Bigot in Le Figaro daily on Thursday.  It is not a country of Platonic love,  they said, warning against the import of what French conservatives have long denigrated as a killjoy  Anglo-Saxon  view of relationships between men and women. Responding to such criticism, Schioppa said:  There is some reluctance, some say we will kill the culture of the  French lover ... if we punish street harassment.   But it s the opposite. We want to preserve seduction, chivalry and  l amour   la francaise  by saying what is key is consent. Between consenting adults everything is allowed, we can seduce, talk, but if someone says  no , it s  no  and it s final,  she said. Much of the French debate focuses on plans to slap fines on harassment in the street and whether that is really feasible. Schiappa acknowledged it was hard to define, adding details would be decided through wide consultations in coming months.  For instance it s following a woman through several blocks or asking for her phone number 15 straight times,  said Schiappa, adding that she personally did not believe wolf-whistles should be characterized as sexual harassment.

The petition was launched within hours after Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson said on Sept. 29 that the Navy would do away with such ratings as gunner\u2019s mate and boatswain\u2019s mate. The plan to abolish the 241-year-old job titles system and replace it with one similar to other armed services\u2019 occupational specialty codes has sparked outrage among some current and former Navy personnel. \u201cOne by one current leadership continues to erode the very things that set the Navy apart from the other services. Mr. President, I and the others signing this petition request you use your authority to restore to our Sailors what they have earned,\u201d the petition said. The request topped 100,000 signatures within 30 days, the requirement needed for official action by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. The online site showed a total of 102,597 signatures on Monday. Officials say the switching of titles would allow the Navy to identify sailors\u2019 skills more accurately and give them better job opportunities when they leave the Navy. The changes followed a review this year. The modernization plan will be implemented in multi-year phases, the Navy has said. Opponents have voiced their anger on Richardson\u2019s Facebook page. Carrie Herr wrote on Saturday, \u201cHelp our Navy enlisted (personnel) restore the honor and tradition that was taken away from them.

        "title": "Trump to release JFK files, subject to 'further information'",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that, subject to receipt of further information, he planned to allow the opening of long-secret files on the November 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy due for release next week. Politico magazine earlier quoted Trump administration and other U.S. government officials as saying the president would almost certainly block the release of information from some of the thousands of classified files, which the U.S. National Archives is scheduled to make public by an Oct. 26 deadline.  \u201cSubject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened,\u201d Trump said in a tweet. \u201cThe president believes that these documents should be made available in the interests of full transparency unless agencies provide a compelling and clear national security or law enforcement justification otherwise,\u201d a White House official said. The Nov. 22 1963 assassination cut short \u201cCamelot,\u201d as the 1,000 days of the Kennedy presidency became known. Kennedy was 46 and remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents. Thousands of books, articles, TV shows, movies and documentaries have been produced about the assassination and surveys have shown a majority of Americans still distrust official evidence pointing to Lee Harvey Oswald as the sole killer. Despite serious questions about the official inquest, and theories purporting that organized crime, Cuba or a cabal of U.S. security agents was involved, conspiracy theorists have yet to produce conclusive proof Oswald acted in consort with anyone. Over the years, the National Archives has released most documents related to the case, but a final batch, amounting to tens of thousands of pages, remains and only Trump has the authority to decide whether some should continue to be withheld or released in redacted form. The Washington Post and other media have quoted officials as saying that government agencies have lobbied Trump to withhold some of the documents, arguing that they could expose relatively recent intelligence and law enforcement operations. Philip Shenon, the author of the Politico article and of a book on the assassination, said he did not think the last batch of papers contained any major bombshells, but may shed light on the activities of Oswald while he was traveling in Mexico City in late September 1963, and courting Cuban and Soviet spies.\u201dFrom the record we already have, we know he met there with Soviet spies and Cuban spies and other people who might have wanted to see Kennedy dead,\u201d Shenon said.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very interesting to see what else the government knew about the threat Oswald might pose \u2013 how much more they learned about his trip in Mexico City and whether or not they bungled evidence to suggest he was a threat.\u201d Shenon said it would be interesting, too, to see if there was anything in the documents to substantiate comments Trump made during his election campaign linking Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s father to Oswald. \u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s favorite conspiracy theory about the Kennedy assassination ... but I don\u2019t think there is,\u201d Shenon said. Cruz\u2019s father Rafael has called Trump\u2019s allegations that he was pictured with Oswald in New Orleans before the assassination \u201cludicrous.\u201d ",

The Foreign Office said Johnson spoke  frankly  with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif about  consular cases of dual nationals  such as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who Britain says was visiting family on holiday when she was jailed by Iran for attempting to overthrow the government. The case has taken on domestic political importance in Britain, especially since Johnson said last month that Zaghari-Ratcliffe trained journalists, which her employer denies. Johnson later apologized. Opponents have called for him to resign if his comments lead to her serving longer in prison. Johnson is also expected to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday to discuss bilateral and regional issues, a Foreign Office official said, during just the third visit by a British foreign minister to Iran in the last 14 years. Talks with Zarif were  constructive , Johnson s office said, despite differences between the two countries.  They both spoke frankly about the obstacles in the relationship, including the Foreign Secretary s concerns about the consular cases of British-Iranian dual nationals,  a British Foreign Office spokeswoman said in a statement. The two-day visit takes place against a complex backdrop of historical, regional and bilateral tensions. Johnson stressed Britain s support for Iran s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers in the meeting, the spokeswoman said. International sanctions against Iran have only recently been lifted as part of the multilateral nuclear deal to curb Tehran s disputed uranium enrichment program.  That deal is under threat after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to decertify Iran s compliance with its terms. Johnson told Zarif he believed the deal should be fully implemented. Johnson also met Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran s Supreme National Security Council, and parliament speaker Ali Larijani during the first day of his two-day visit, Iran s state news agency IRNA reported. The Foreign Office statement did not mention Zaghari-Ratcliffe by name, although Johnson has vowed to leave  no stone unturned  in Britain s efforts to free her.  A project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, she was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment. She denies the charges. Zaghari-Ratcliffe is not the only dual national being held in Iran, but has become the most high-profile case. The Thomson Reuters Foundation is a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. It says Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been on holiday and had not been teaching journalism in Iran. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been told she will appear in court on Dec. 10, her husband Richard has said. The visit is a test of Johnson s ability to navigate a political landscape littered with potential pitfalls. Iran s 1979 Islamic Revolution turned it into a pariah state for most of the West and many Middle Eastern neighbors. Britain has voiced its continued support for the nuclear deal but is one of a number of Western powers voicing concerns about Tehran s  destabilizing  influence in the region. ",

        "title": "Senator Cornyn trying to get Big Corn behind U.S. biofuels reform",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, is trying to win support from the Midwest corn lobby for a broad legislative overhaul of the nation\u2019s biofuels policy, according to sources familiar with the matter. The effort comes as President Donald Trump\u2019s White House mediates talks between the rival oil and corn industries over the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires oil refiners to blend increasing amounts of corn-based ethanol and other biofuels in the nation\u2019s fuel supply every year. Oil refiners say the regulation costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year and is threatening to put a handful of the nation\u2019s refineries out of business. Ethanol interests have so far refused to budge on proposals to change it. Cornyn \u201cis working hard to unify all stakeholders in a consensus effort to reform the Renewable Fuel Standard,\u201d an aide to the senator told Reuters. The aide, who asked not to be named, did not provide details. Cornyn, of Texas, the U.S. state that is home to the most oil refineries, is part of the Senate\u2019s leadership team, responsible for securing the votes needed to pass the Republican party\u2019s legislative agenda. Two lobbyists for the oil refining industry said Cornyn was having some success cobbling together a coalition of lawmakers and stakeholders around a potential RFS reform bill that could be dropped early next year. However, similar efforts to unify these rival factions have fallen flat in the past. Any such effort would need the buy-in of legislative backers of the ethanol industry, like Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, the top-producing state for corn. Officials for the senators did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Both Grassley and Ernst have previously repeatedly expressed their intention to defend the RFS in its current form. The White House has been hosting negotiations between both sides of the issue over short-term remedies that can provide relief to refiners struggling with the existing regulation. The refining industry says compliance now costs it hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and threatens to put some refineries out of business. Refineries that do not have adequate facilities to blend ethanol into their gasoline must purchase blending credits, called RINS, from rivals that do. RIN prices have risen in recent years as the amount of biofuels required under the RFS has increased. Refineries that buy RINs include Philadelphia Energy Solutions and Monroe Energy, both of Pennsylvania, and Valero Energy Corp of Texas. Valero said RINs cost it around $750 million last year, though there are competing arguments over whether refiners pass along those costs. Senator Ted Cruz, also of Texas, last week sent a proposal to the White House to cap the price of RINs at 10 cents each, a fraction of the current price. The proposal was widely rejected by the ethanol industry. The ethanol industry has said in the past that placing caps on the credits was a non-starter, and has instead argued for policies to increase volumes of ethanol in the U.S gasoline supply. The industry claims this would boost supplies of the credits, lowering their prices. Prices of renewable fuel credits have fallen in recent weeks on reports of the discussions in Washington. The price hit 68 cents on Wednesday, nearing a seven-month low, according to traders and Oil Price Information Services. The White House has not yet commented on Cruz\u2019s proposal. The RFS was introduced by former President George W. Bush as a way to boost U.S. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions. It has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year. The refining industry has pressed the Trump administration repeatedly to adopt reforms that would lower the credit costs or otherwise ease the burden on refineries, but the ethanol industry has successfully defeated those efforts so far.

        "title": "Holding keys to debt limit, Democrats weigh tax demands",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. Congress wield little clout nowadays, but they will likely have plenty of influence on the looming issue of the U.S. debt ceiling and party leaders are considering whether they should try to convert that advantage into bargaining power on tax reform. Even though they control the White House and both chambers of Congress, Republicans are again divided among themselves as pressing fiscal issues rattle financial markets and test President Donald Trump\u2019s ability to keep the country\u2019s accounts in order. The debt ceiling is a legal cap on how much money the federal government can borrow to fund its budget deficits and meet debt obligations. Failure to meet payments could lead to a default and a downgrade in America\u2019s credit rating, with the potential to trigger global financial shockwaves. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was \u201c100 percent confident\u201d that the debt ceiling would be raised in September. \u201cThere is no scenario where the government won\u2019t be paying its bills,\u201d Mnuchin said. Action is needed to raise the debt ceiling by Sept. 29, the administration has warned, although some fiscal experts say the deadline may actually be mid-October. The Trump administration wants Congress to pass a \u201cclean\u201d increase, without extraneous political measures attached. But, reflecting long divisions in the party over fiscal policy, many conservative Republicans have said they will not  vote for a debt-limit bill that does not also contain promises of federal spending cuts. So, analysts say, Trump and Republican leaders will need the votes of Democrats, who generally favor a clean bill, to raise the debt limit and avoid a default. Armed with this edge, Democrats are considering using the debt debate to press Republicans for bipartisan tax reform, said Democratic Senate aides, which would inject new uncertainty into the debt limit issue. Overhauling the tax code is a top priority for Trump and his fellow Republicans, but they have made little progress since the president took office in January. Their behind-closed-doors planning process so far on tax reform has ignored the Democrats. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi are skeptical about supporting a debt ceiling increase while Republicans pursue tax cuts that Democrats say would cause the federal deficit to balloon. \u201cWe\u2019re telling Republicans that if it is their intention to use that debt limit increase to allow for tax cuts for the wealthy, that they are going to have a harder time getting Democratic votes,\u201d said a Senate Democratic aide. Senate Democrats offered earlier this month to move forward with bipartisan legislation on taxes, on condition that changes do not add to the deficit or benefit the wealthy. For now, Senate and House Democrats are watching  Republicans and the Trump administration wrangle over the debt ceiling, with no clear plan yet in sight. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have not said if they want a clean bill. Ryan said on Thursday that Congress will pass legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling, noting that lawmakers have several options. McConnell has said the debt ceiling will be raised, a spokesman said on Thursday. Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said in an email: \u201cLeader Pelosi has expressed support for a clean debt ceiling hike, but has also echoed the concerns that many House Democrats have about supporting such a move while Republicans simultaneously blow a multi-trillion dollar hole in the deficit with tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.\u201d Given the stakes, Schumer and Pelosi would face a daunting task in holding their parties\u2019 lawmakers together if they want to squeeze concessions out of Republicans with the country on the brink of a potential default. Some Democrats are skeptical such a strategy could work. \u201cWe ought to get the debt ceiling done. It\u2019s a bad precedent to try to use the debt ceiling for leverage for other political objectives,\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell expressed concern on Friday about the possibility of the debt ceiling not being raised.  \u201cIf the debt ceiling were not to be raised, the United States would not be able to pay all of its bills. That\u2019s never happened before; it would be unprecedented and that could be a major shock to the economy,\u201d Powell said in an interview with CNBC during a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Democrats have been talking about using the debt ceiling as a lever against Republican tax reform since June and laid out their conditions for working together on tax legislation in an Aug. 1 letter to Trump and Republican leaders. McConnell flatly rejected the idea of broad bipartisanship. But it could be the only way forward on taxes if Republicans cannot agree on a budget resolution for fiscal 2018. That is needed to unlock a legislative provision that would allow them to pass a tax bill in the Senate, where Republicans have only a slim majority, without Democratic support.     ",

        "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey regrets the vetoing by the United States on Monday of a U.N. Security Council resolution that called for the U.S. declaration of Jerusalem as Israel s capital to be withdrawn, the Turkish foreign ministry said.  The United States was further isolated over President Donald Trump s decision when it blocked a United Nations Security Council call for the declaration to be withdrawn despite the other 14 members voting in favor of it.  The United States being left alone in the vote is a concrete sign of the illegality of its decision on Jerusalem,  the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. It said the U.S. decision to veto the resolution showed once again that Washington had  lost objectivity  and that it was unacceptable for the Security Council to be left  ineffective  with such a move. Later on Monday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and British Prime Minister Theresa May discussed the blocking of the resolution in a phone call, and agreed that new tensions that could endanger the peace process in the region should be avoided, sources in Erdogan s office said. Erdogan has taken a leading position in opposing the U.S. move to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, hosting representatives from more than 50 Muslim countries, including U.S. allies, in Istanbul last week for a summit in response. A communique issued after the summit said the participants considered the move to be a declaration that Washington was withdrawing from its role  as sponsor of peace  in the Middle East. Trump s decision broke with decades of U.S. policy and international consensus that Jerusalem s status must be left to Israeli-Palestinian talks, leading to harsh criticisms from Muslim countries and Israel s closest European allies, who have also rejected the move. Jerusalem, revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, is home to Islam s third-holiest site and has been at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it in an action not recognized internationally. Following the U.S. block on the U.N. resolution, a spokesman for Erdogan said that the annulment of Trump s decision would be sought in the U.N. General Assembly.  All countries except for the Trump administration acted in unison in this vote. Now the UN General Assembly period will start,  Ibrahim Kalin said on Twitter. ",

        "title": "Trump's Justice No. 2 rebuffs Democrats on Russia probe",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The lawyer who will take control of an investigation into Russian meddling in last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election, if he wins Senate confirmation to become deputy attorney general, rebuffed Democrats\u2019 demands on Tuesday for the appointment of a special prosecutor in the case. Rod Rosenstein, now U.S. Attorney for Maryland, faced tough questioning, especially from Democrats, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on his nomination by President Donald Trump to fill the Justice Department\u2019s No. 2 job. Coming amid persistent questions about ties between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia, Rosenstein\u2019s nomination has catapulted him into the center of an issue that Trump has been unable to put behind him in his first six weeks in office. California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein asked Rosenstein, \u201cDo you support an independent, outside counsel?\u201d He said he could not commit to that approach before learning the facts of the case. \u201cMy view is that I have a responsibility to not take the job conditional on how I [will handle] a particular case,\u201d Rosenstein said. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the politically-charged inquiry last week after admitting he met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak during the campaign. Sessions had previously testified he had no contact with Russian officials. Trump fired national security adviser Michael Flynn last month after disclosures that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with Kislyak before Trump took office and then misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trump\u2019s favor. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Democrats at the hearing said only a special prosecutor could ensure that the investigation would be free of pressure from Trump, who has accused officials in former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s administration of trying to discredit him with questions about Russia contacts. Trump called frequently during his campaign for improved relations with Russia. U.S.-Russian relations have been deeply strained in recent years over Moscow\u2019s military interference in Ukraine, military support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria and President Vladimir Putin\u2019s intolerance of political dissent. Republicans at the hearing said it was too soon to know whether a special counsel was appropriate in the case. Rosenstein noted that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch had been asked to appoint a special prosecutor when the allegations first came to light. He said she rejected the request and chose to use career prosecutors in the case. Rosenstein has experience working for a special counsel on investigations involving the presidency. In the mid-1990s he was part of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr\u2019s team of prosecutors who investigated Bill and Hillary Clinton. The 26-year Justice Department veteran is seen by many current and former department officials as a politically neutral pick. \u201cPolitical affiliations are irrelevant to my work,\u201d Rosenstein told the committee. Named as Maryland\u2019s top prosecutor by President George W. Bush, Rosenstein stayed in office through the Obama administration. \u201cMr. Rosenstein should commit to naming a special prosecutor to look into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia,\u201d said Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer in a statement.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday unanimously confirmed two nominees to serve on the Federal Communications Commission as the Trump administration looks to reverse many Obama-era telecommunications regulations. Brendan Carr, a Republican who is general counsel at the FCC  and Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, were both confirmed by voice vote, bringing the five-member FCC to full strength and giving Republicans a 3-2 majority. Rosenworcel served as a commissioner for the regulator until the end of 2016 when lawmakers failed to take up her renomination under former President Barack Obama. The FCC, which since January has been controlled by Republicans by a 2-1 margin, is working to reverse a number of Obama-era telecommunications regulations, including the landmark 2015 net-neutrality rules prohibiting broadband providers from giving or selling access to certain internet services over others.  The Senate did not immediately vote to reconfirm FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to another term, even though he appeared at a confirmation hearing in July with the other nominees. Pai would need to leave the commission by the end of the year if he were not reconfirmed. In a statement, Pai praised Rosenworcel and Carr\u2019s confirmations and said they have \u201cdistinguished records of public service and will be valuable assets to the FCC in the years to come.\u00a0Their experience at the FCC makes them particularly well-suited to hit the ground running.\u201d Pai, chosen by Trump in January to head the agency, also has said he wants to dismantle other significant regulations as part of a sweeping review he said would remove barriers to business and modernize rules. Pai also plans significant changes to local TV ownership limits and plans other changes to media regulations. Democrats insisted Republicans had agreed in 2015 to reconfirm Rosenworcel as part of a deal to confirm FCC Commissioner Mike O\u2019Rielly. Republicans denied there was a deal but the standoff had delayed consideration of telecommunications legislation in the Senate. Under Pai, the FCC chose not to review AT&T Inc\u2019s planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc.  The FCC is currently reviewing Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc\u2019s proposed $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co, one of the largest U.S. TV station operators.  ",

        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China s prosecutor began on Monday formal legal proceedings against disgraced senior politician Sun Zhengcai, once considered a contender for top leadership, who has been accused of corruption and other crimes. Sun was abruptly removed from his post as party chief of the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing - one of China s most important cities - in July and replaced by Chen Miner, who is close to President Xi Jinping.  Later that month, he was put under investigation and in September, the party announced he would be prosecuted for corruption. Sun was accused of leaking secrets, bribery and abusing his power. In a brief statement, the prosecutor said that it had begun proceedings against Sun for suspected bribery and had approved the taking of  coercive measures  against him, a Chinese legal term that generally refers to detention. The case is proceeding, it added, without giving any other details. Sun was expelled from parliament last month, removing his immunity from prosecution that he had enjoyed as a member of that body. Chongqing is perhaps best known outside China for its association with Bo Xilai, another disgraced former party boss of the city. He, too, was once a contender for top leadership. He was jailed for life in 2013 after a dramatic corruption scandal. It has not been possible to reach Sun or a representative for comment since he was put under investigation. It s unclear if he has been allowed to retain a lawyer. The next likely step against Sun will be to put him on trial, where he is certain to be found guilty as the legal system is controlled by the ruling Communist Party which will not challenge the party s accusations against him.

China will open still wider and its development will deliver even greater benefits to the rest of the world,  Xi told the APEC leaders.

        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China s capital unveiled the  shining example  of its 80 billion yuan ( 9.1 billion) new airport on Monday, tipped to become one of the world s largest when it opens in October 2019 amid a massive infrastructure drive overseen by President Xi Jinping.   Representatives showed off the sprawling skeleton of  Beijing New Airport , which is made up of 1.6 million cubic meters of concrete, 52,000 tonnes of steel and spans a total 47 sq km (18 sq miles), including runways.  It is expected to serve an initial 45 million passengers a year with an eventual capacity of 100 million, putting it on par with Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.   Lined up together there s roughly 5 km of gates,  said project spokesman Zhu Wenxin.  It s a shining example of China s national production capacity.   Updates on the airport come as the ruling Communist Party is set to open its 19th congress later this week, a twice-a-decade leadership event where Xi will consolidate power and emphasize successful projects and policy from his first five years. The project, which broke ground in 2014, is one of the region s largest infrastructure investments under Xi s rule, which has been plagued by fears of slowing economic growth, offset slightly by a construction spree. China has sought to boost its profile as both an aviation hub and a manufacturer in recent years. The country s first home-grown passenger jet, the C919, lifted off on its maiden flight in May, edging into a multibillion-dollar market currently dominated by Boeing Co and Airbus SE. Situated 67 km south of Beijing, the airport technically falls in neighboring Hebei province, though it will eventually constitute its own development zone. It will relieve pressure on Beijing s existing international airport, to the northeast of Beijing and currently the world s second largest by passenger volume, which opened a new terminal worth $3.6 billion ( 2.7 billion) in 2008 ahead of the Beijing Summer Olympics.  The existing airport will continue to operate major international flights, though a third smaller domestic airport in the city s south will close in coming years.   Two of China s three major airlines, China Eastern Airlines Corp and China Southern Airlines Co, will relocate to the airport on completion, accounting for roughly four-fifths of the new airport s total traffic. The airport will be connected to Beijing by a high speed train with a top speed of 350 km an hour, as well as an inter-city train and a major expressway.  Original plans for the airport were made by French airports operator Aeroports de Paris, though third-party improvements to the original version make the final design  wholly domestic , said Zhu.  It s like a large flower, but made of steel,  said one construction worker on the site, who declined to share his name because he was not authorized to speak to press. ",

ARD said Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, a member of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), decided to drop an appeal filed just days ago, allow the ruling to take effect, following intense criticism by top SPD leaders.  The ruling was the first to deal with the right of under-age migrants to bring their families to Germany and could set a new precedent, ARD reported.  The foreign ministry had no immediate comment on the issue, but Gabriel told the broadcaster:  We know that it is bad, of course, when minors are here without their parents. It s a good thing that we now have clarity.  The ministry s reversal on the issue comes as Gabriel s party prepares to enter talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives about continuing the  grand coalition  that has ruled Germany for the past four years.  Migration - and the issue of allowing migrants to bring family members to Germany - could be a key topic in the coalition talks, which are due to begin on Jan. 7. Merkel had failed to reach agreement with two smaller parties. The case in question centers on a Syrian youth who arrived in Germany in the summer of 2015 with an older cousin, and was granted only  subsidiary protection  rather than full asylum. In 2016, the government had decided to suspend family re-unifications for two years for migrants with  subsidiary protection , which is granted to people who are not considered as being persecuted individually but in whose home country there is war, torture or other inhumane treatment. The court said that rejecting the family reunification in this case violated child welfare protections guaranteed under the European human rights convention and the U.N. Refugee Convention. ",

        "title": "Catalan leader under pressure to drop independence",
        "text": "BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia s secessionist leader faced increased pressure on Monday to abandon plans to declare independence from Spain, with France and Germany expressing support for the country s unity. The Madrid government, grappling with Spain s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981, said it would respond immediately to any such unilateral declaration.  A week after a vote on independence which the government did its utmost to thwart, the tension also took its toll on the business climate of Spain s wealthiest region. Three more Catalonia-based companies joined a business exodus from the region that has gathered steam since the Oct. 1 referendum. Property group Inmobiliaria Colonial (COL.MC) and infrastructure firm Abertis (ABE.MC) both decided to relocate their head offices to Madrid and telecoms firm Cellnex (CLNX.MC) said it would do the same for as long as political uncertainty in Catalonia continued. Publishing house Grupo Planeta said it would move its registered office from Barcelona to Madrid if the Catalan parliament unilaterally declared independence. Spain s finance minister said it was the Catalan government s fault the companies were leaving.  Regional leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the regional parliament on Tuesday afternoon and Madrid is worried it will vote for a unilateral declaration of independence.   Catalan officials say people voted overwhelmingly for secession in the Oct. 1 referendum, which had been declared illegal by the government. Some 900 people were injured on polling day when police fired rubber bullets and stormed crowds with truncheons to disrupt the voting. The issue has deeply divided the northeastern region as well as the Spanish nation. Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated against breaking away in Barcelona at the weekend. They say the referendum did not show the true will of the region because those who want to stay in Spain mainly boycotted it. Buoyed by the show of support, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamar a said on Monday:  I m calling on the sensible people in the Catalan government ... don t jump off the edge because you ll take the people with you.    If there is a unilateral declaration of independence there will be decisions made to restore law and democracy,  she told COPE radio station. Underlining conflicting pressures on Puigdemont, the small, anti-capitalist Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP) party, which has an outsized influence on his government, said the outcome of the vote must be applied.  We don t want to hold up the declaration of the Catalan republic,  CUP lawmaker Benet Salellas told a news conference. European heavyweights Germany and France weighed in against a split. German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Saturday, stressing her support for Spain s unity but encouraging dialogue, her spokesman said. France said it would not recognize Catalonia if the region unilaterally declared independence. If secession were recognized it would lead to Catalonia s automatic exit from the European Union, a French junior minister said.  This crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of Spanish politics,  France s European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said. The European Union has shown no interest in an independent Catalonia, despite an appeal by Puigdemont for Brussels to mediate in the crisis. Under Catalonia s referendum law, deemed unconstitutional by Madrid, a vote for independence in the assembly on Tuesday would start a six-month process envisaging divorce talks with Spain before regional elections and a final act of separation. Rajoy gained some political cover on Monday for the so-called  nuclear option  of removing Catalonia s government and calling new regional elections. Opposition Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez said he would  support the response of the rule of law in the face of any attempt to break social harmony , but stopped short of explicitly saying his party would back dissolving the regional parliament. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau advised Puigdemont against proclaiming independence on the basis of the referendum results and she urged Rajoy to rule out suspending Catalonia s autonomy. Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.  The crisis has reopened old divisions in a nation where the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism. A spokesman for the ruling People s Party (PP) invoked the memory of former Catalan leader Lluis Companys, who was arrested for declaring independence in 1934 and later executed.    We hope they don t declare anything tomorrow, because anyone doing so might end up like him 83 years ago, in prison,  Pablo Casado told a news conference in Madrid.  Many moderate Spaniards, including in Catalonia, oppose a breakaway. Regional authorities say about 90 percent of votes in the referendum were for secession, but turnout was only 43 percent. Sunday's anti-independence demonstration helped calm financial markets, as did credit rating agencies Moody's and DBRS which said they expected Spain to remain united. Spanish borrowing costs fell to a one-week low and the main share index .IBEX touched a week high. Puigdemont appeared resolute on Sunday, saying the  referendum law called for a declaration of independence in the event of a  yes  vote.  We will apply what the law says,  he told TV3. Catalonia s High Court asked for more security, specifically drafting in the national police, who were called in to stop the referendum when the Catalan police force failed to act. Puigdemont said on Sunday he had not been in contact with the Madrid government for some time because it refused to discuss independence.   What is happening in Catalonia is real, whether they like it or not. Millions of people have voted, who want to decide. We have to talk about this,  he said. Rajoy has said repeatedly he will not talk to the Catalan leaders unless they drop their plans to declare independence. ",

        "title": "Chinese fans prepare to welcome rich, powerful, 'free-spirit' Trump",
        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - He may be a divisive figure back home, but U.S. President Donald Trump will be landing in friendly territory when he arrives in Beijing on Wednesday, judging by Chinese social media. On platforms such as the Twitter-like Sina Weibo, Trump s Chinese supporters, who admire his business success and a free-wheeling style unconstrained by political correctness, are far more prominent than detractors. While no comprehensive survey has been done to assess the size and intensity of Trump s popularity in China, several pundits suggest he has broad and vocal support.  Chinese people are impressed that he is extremely rich, he loves things splendid and magnificent, and he loves to show off. Not every billionaire is like that,  said Yin Hao, who translates American news and comedy clips for his nearly one million followers on Weibo.     Yin said his translated Trump-related video clips sometimes attract thousands of comments, where some supporters engage in name-calling and invective in defending the president.  They will keep posting comments to defend Trump, mock his opponents under all news clips that involve Trump, and rebuke any comments that are not in favor of Trump,  Yin said. Chen Jibing, a Shanghai-based political commentator, said Trump s Chinese fan base is different than that for previous foreign leaders such as his predecessor, Barack Obama, and for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who enjoyed widespread but tepid support.  Chinese Trump fans are seriously and truly invested, and you had better not make light of offending them,  Chen wrote in a social media post to his millions of followers. While Trump encountered protests during his visits to Japan and South Korea on the first two legs of his 12-day Asian tour, such scenes are unlikely in China, which tightly controls public gatherings, with media and the internet subject to censorship. China s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said Trump will receive a  state visit-plus  experience in Beijing. He is expected to go to the Forbidden City and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops, though China has released few other details. Trump s popularity in China largely comes from his disdain for political correctness and defiance of traditional liberal western views, which many Chinese consider elitist and unrealistic, Chen said. His criticism of the U.S. trade deficit with China, for example, is seen by many in the country as standard U.S. political talk, some pundits say.     In China, realists hold a deep-rooted belief that the rule of the jungle means the strong prey on the weak,  Chen said.  For them, the world is not split into right and wrong, good or evil, it is only success or failure, the powerful and the weak.   Factual errors or gaffes by Trump tend to be ignored by his Chinese fans or explained away as harmless mistakes made by a leader who writes his own rules. In Japan on Monday, Trump told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the Japanese economy was not performing as well as the United States  and appeared to mistakenly say that Japan s economy was the world s second-largest. It is actually third, after China s. An editor at a major state publication told Reuters was inclined to be forgiving about Trump s remark to Abe:  He s a free spirit. No one can tell him what to do.    Many on Chinese social media see Trump as a figure of fun.  Rather than being a president, Trump is more like a comedian!  one Weibo user wrote. In a country where parents are traditionally judged by the success of their children, Trump scores extra points for his daughter Ivanka, a businesswoman and currently advisor to President Trump, and her Mandarin-speaking children. One Chinese state publication said that all five of Trump s children are a testament to his character.  You can tell what parents are like through their childrens  success. Trump s five children are all excellent, it means he is a very successful father,  the China Education Daily said on its social media account. Ivanka Trump is sometimes referred to as  goddess  on Chinese social media, where some were upset that the first daughter would not be accompanying her father to Beijing.  SAD! Ivanka is not coming to China,  said Jiang Xiaofeng, a journalist with Phoenix TV on Sina Weibo, appropriating one of Donald Trump s favorite Twitter exclamations.  ",

        "text": "PHOENIX (Reuters) - The Democratic National Committee will file a federal lawsuit over the actions of Arizona election officials during the presidential primary that caused long waits at the polls and critics said disenfranchised voters, especially minorities.   Officials said the lawsuit, to be filed in U.S. District Court in Arizona on Friday, will target the decision to sharply reduce polling locations in Maricopa County, which caused up to five-hour waits for voters casting ballots in the March 22 primary. The lawsuit will also question the state\u2019s \u201carbitrary rejection of provisional ballots at alarming rates,\u201d with a large number coming from minority voters, according to a DNC statement. \u201cRepublicans are using every tool, every legal loophole and every fear tactic they can think of to take aim at voting rights wherever they can,\u201d the DNC chair, U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, said in a statement.  Joining the suit will be the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Arizona Democratic Party, former Navajo Nation leader Peterson Zah, the Ann Kirkpatrick for Senate campaign and affected voters, the statement said. The Democratic nominating contest for the Nov. 8 presidential election was won by Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders. Their campaigns both said they would join the lawsuit. Named as defendants in the legal action are Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors and Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell. A spokesman for the secretary of state declined to comment on the specifics of the case, saying: \u201cThe secretary welcomes any inquiry.\u201d  A spokeswoman for Purcell declined to comment but told CNN last week there were no intentional efforts to keep people from voting. The election became mired in controversy from the outset as county voters spent hours to vote at one of 60 polling sites, a reduction from 200 sites in 2012. Officials said the move was an effort to cut costs. County officials immediately took the blame for the decision, saying they misjudged voter turnout based on recent history and increasing mail-in votes.  The election, called unacceptable by the state\u2019s governor and a fiasco by the Phoenix mayor, has prompted questions by the U.S. Department of Justice over its handling by county officials.  The county, Arizona\u2019s most populous, has said it will comply with an April 22 request for information from the head of the voting section of the department\u2019s civil rights division.

        "title": "Chinese academics prod Beijing to consider North Korea contingencies",
        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese academics are publicly broaching the idea that China and the United States should share plans on how to deal with a  potential conflict on the Korean Peninsula, a sign some say of how North Korea s weapons test may be making Beijing more open to the once taboo subject. Chinese officials have rebuffed top U.S. military brass for years in their efforts to share contingencies for war or regime collapse in Pyongyang, suspicious over Washington s intentions and fearful that such engagement could further alienate North Korea, their once steadfast wartime ally. Jia Qingguo, the dean of the School of International Studies at China s elite Peking University and a respected advisor to Chinese leaders, said in an article this week that with the chances of war increasing daily, it might be time for China to  prepare for the worst .  When war becomes a real possibility, China must be prepared. And, with this in mind, China must be more willing to consider talks with concerned countries on contingency plans,  Jia wrote in an article first published on the online East Asia Forum run out of Australian National University. Given recent developments,  Beijing may have no better choice than to start talking with Washington and Seoul , Jia said. Ties between China and North Korea have deteriorated sharply in recent years, to the point some diplomats and experts fear Beijing may become, like Washington, a target of its neighbor s ire. Jia s comments, at the forefront of what is still a sensitive debate in China, were made before North Korea on Friday fired a missile that flew over Japan s northern Hokkaido far out into the Pacific Ocean.  That test came after the U.N. Security Council s latest round of sanctions on Monday banning North Korea s textile exports and capping fuel supplies in response to Pyongyang s accelerated effort to target the United States with a powerful, nuclear-tipped missile. Xie Tao, associate dean at the School of English and International Studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said Chinese academics in years past would typically only express their opinions on whether China should be sharing plans with Washington behind closed doors.  Now you can get all sorts of people from the left and right and they are allowed to make their views public,  Xie told Reuters.  You could interpret that as a signal that the Chinese government is perhaps willing now to consider, if not actually join up to, contingency plans,  Xie said.  My sense is that there must be some in-depth discussion about what could potentially happen if there is a collapse or internal chaos   how Beijing and Washington should respond to this.  During a trip to China in August, Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended Chinese military drills at China s Northern Theater Command in the city of Shenyang, which covers China s border with North Korea.  Some analysts perceived that as China opening a crack in the door to its own preparations, but neither side are showing their cards to the public. Dunford said in Beijing during that visit that despite Washington s urgings the  conditions aren t set for such a detailed conversation  between the two militaries.  U.S. military officials have privately voiced frustration that previous channels established for direct military communications line are essentially unstaffed on the Chinese side. Dunford said creating a round-the-clock  responsive  communications link that could be used in a crisis was a top priority for military ties.

        "title": "Factbox: Why the Zika virus is causing alarm",
        "text": "Global health officials are racing to better understand the Zika virus behind a major outbreak that began in Brazil last year and has spread to many countries in the Americas.  The following are some questions and answers about the virus and current outbreak: How do people become infected? Zika is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same type that spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said Aedes mosquitoes are found in all countries in the Americas except Canada and continental Chile, and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where Aedes mosquitoes are found. How do you treat Zika? There is no treatment or vaccine for Zika infection. Companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Zika, but the World Health Organization (WHO) had said early in 2016 that it would take at least 18 months to start large-scale clinical trials of potential preventative shots. A vaccine is not expected to be ready for widespread use for at least two or three years. U.S. government researchers said they started their first clinical trial of a Zika vaccine. How dangerous is it? The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that infection with the Zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies. The CDC said now that the causal relationship has been established, several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years. According to the World Health Organization, there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems. In addition, the agency said it could cause Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis. Conclusive proof of the damage caused by Zika may take months or years. Brazil reports the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly at more than 1,700 as doctors and Brazilian health officials find that some suspected cases of microcephaly are not the disorder. Suspected ones under investigation had declined to 3,257. Brazil registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus from February until April 2. Current research in Brazil indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks. Recent studies have shown evidence of Zika in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal brain tissue. What are the symptoms of Zika infection?     People infected with Zika may have a mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days. But as many as 80 percent of people infected never develop symptoms. The symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito. How can Zika be contained? Efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets. U.S. and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to Latin American and Caribbean countries where they may be exposed to Zika. How widespread is the outbreak? Active Zika outbreaks have been reported in at least 54 countries or territories, most of them in the Americas, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brazil has been the country most affected. (1.usa.gov/1ovAJyh) Africa (1): Cape Verde  Americas (45): Anguilla, Antigua, Argentina, Aruba, Barbados, Barbuda, Belize, Bolivia, Bonaire, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cura\u00e7ao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saba, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelmy, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Eustatius, St. Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Cacos, U.S. Virgin Islands and Venezuela. Oceania/Pacific Islands (8): American Samoa, Fiji, Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga.  What is the history of the Zika virus? The Zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations. Outbreaks of Zika have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Southern Asia and the Western Pacific. The virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in 1952 in Uganda and Tanzania, according to the WHO.  Can Zika be transmitted through sexual contact? The World Health Organization (WHO) said sexual transmission is \u201crelatively common\u201d and has advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks of Zika virus. It also  advised women living in areas where the virus is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant. The U.S. CDC is investigating about a dozen cases of possible sexual transmission. Those cases involved possible transmission of the virus from men to their sex partners. But the CDC issued updated recommendations for preventing and testing for Zika infection on July 25, warning that the virus can be transmitted through unprotected sex with an infected female partner. A reported case of female-to-male sexual transmission in New York City, and limited human and non-human primate data indicating that Zika virus RNA can be detected in vaginal secretions, led to the new warning, the agency said. CDC\u2019s expanded warnings on sexual exposure to Zika now  caution against sex without a condom or other barrier method of protection with any person, male or female, who has traveled to or lives in an area with Zika, including female to female transmission with a pregnant partner. British health officials reported Zika was found in a man\u2019s semen two months after he was infected, suggesting the virus may linger in semen long after infection symptoms fade. The PAHO said Zika can be transmitted through blood, but this is an infrequent transmission mechanism. There is no evidence Zika can be transmitted to babies through breast milk. The WHO has identified Zika cases in Argentina, Chile, France, Italy and New Zealand as likely caused by sexual transmission.  What other complications are associated with Zika? Zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders, including serious brain and spinal cord infections. The long-term health consequences of Zika infection are unclear. Other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how Zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue. ",

        "text": "HANOI (Reuters) - In a telephone call, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump told Vietnam\u2019s prime minister he wanted to further strengthen fast-warming ties between the two countries, the government of the Southeast Asian nation said on Thursday. Vietnam has advanced ties with the United States to a new level under the Obama administration as it faces down communist neighbor China\u2019s challenge to its territorial claims in the busy waterway of the South China Sea.    During Wednesday\u2019s conversation, Vietnamese premier Nguyen Xuan Phuc congratulated Trump on his election win and stressed the importance of maintaining friendship and cooperation. \u201cPresident-elect Trump spoke highly of the achievements of Vietnam, as well as the positive developments in bilateral ties,\u201d Vietnam\u2019s government said on its news website. \u201cHe also asserted his wish to cooperate with Vietnam to accelerate the relationship between the two countries.\u201d Trump has had conversations with several leaders of countries locked in maritime disputes with China, among them Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan. His trade platform runs counter to Vietnam\u2019s interests, however, with his opposition to a Trans-Pacific Partnership proving a major setback for Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest exporter to the United States. Trump and Phuc discussed ways to promote economic ties, trade and investment, the government added. In a statement, Trump\u2019s transition team confirmed the conversation, saying the two men \u201cdiscussed a range of shared\u00a0interests\u00a0and agreed to work together to continue strengthening the\u00a0relationship between the two nations\u201d. Just days after Trump\u2019s win, Phuc told parliament that ratification of the TPP would be shelved because of political changes in the United States, but Vietnam still wanted good relations with Washington.    In a separate development, a U.S. guided-missile destroyer, the Mustin, visited Cam Ranh international port on Thursday in a routine technical stop, the U.S. embassy said.  The ship\u2019s visit was \u201can example of the depth of our comprehensive partnership and the importance of strengthening our civilian and military ties,\u201d said U.S. Ambassador Ted Osius. Vietnam has expressed support for the United States to maintain its security presence in Asia. Washington fully lifted a U.S. lethal arms embargo on Vietnam in May, allowing closer defense links and some joint military exercises. ",

        "title": "China says its people have more civil, political rights than ever before",
        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Friday that its people today enjoy the greatest level of political and civil rights ever, in a report issued just days after the European Union and United States expressed extreme concern over a deterioration in human rights in China. In the last five years, Chinese president Xi Jinping has presided over what rights groups decry as an elevated crackdown on the country s rights activists and lawyers, with dozens arrested and hundreds detained. Ahead of Human Rights Day last Sunday, the European Union and the United States released statements saying they were  extremely concerned  about a deterioration of human rights in China, citing measures such as internet restrictions and detentions of lawyers.  Chinese citizens have never before enjoyed as ample economic, social, cultural, as well as civil and political rights, as they do today,  the State Council, China s cabinet, said in an annual white paper.         The paper heralded a new era where greater legal protection ensures human rights in China, citing as evidence the ruling Communist Party s recent establishment of a central leadership group to guide legal reform. Rights group says the lack of an independent judiciary to keep a check on the ruling party leads to abuse of rights. China rejects criticisms of its human rights record, saying that the critics place too much emphasis on political and civil rights, without recognizing the social and economic freedoms being provided to its citizens. Diplomats from liberal democracies say that the Chinese definition is overly broad and ignores aspects like free speech that are essential to the accepted definition of human rights used by the United Nations. China considers its human rights successes to include, for example, using law to control infringement on the health and property rights of its citizens by closing down polluting companies, according to the report. Controversial legislation on spying, counter-espionage and internet security, as well as others in a series of new laws to bolster China s national security, are also cited as helping to protect citizen s security and property. The paper further says that China is actively working to promote human rights overseas and to build a international legal system to protect them. Up to August 2017, 36,000 Chinese military peacekeepers have been sent abroad to take part in UN peacekeeping operations and now have a standing force of 8,000 troops, the paper said. ",

        "title": "Russian opposition leader's fraud conviction arbitrary, Europe's top rights court says",
        "text": "STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - Europe s top human rights court ruled on Tuesday that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny s conviction for fraud in 2014 had been  arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable  and ordered Russia to pay him compensation.  We have won. Thanks everyone for support,  tweeted Navalny, a campaigner against corruption among Russia s elite who hopes to run against Vladimir Putin in a March election. Putin is widely expected to seek and win a fourth term as president.  Russian authorities have three months to decide whether to appeal against the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), the TASS news agency cited Russia s deputy justice minister and ECHR representative Mikhail Galperin as saying.  We proved that this case was a fabricated one, and that this ugly buffoonery in the court room in 2014 had nothing to do with a fair legal proceeding,  Navalny wrote on his website, www.navalny.com, after the court announced its ruling. A suspended jail sentence in a separate case   which Navalny says was politically motivated   may still bar him from running for president. The Strasbourg-based ECHR said Navalny and his brother Oleg s convictions for fraud and money laundering were based on an unforeseeable application of criminal law and that the proceedings were arbitrary and unfair.  I am glad that justice was done,  Navalny wrote.  He said the case against him had been staged to thwart his anti-corruption and political activities through the pressure put on him and his family.  When thieves and swindlers in power declare that I cannot run (for president) because of  the law ,  the sentence , because (I am)  a criminal  and  recidivist , we can show them with confidence what they will never have   a decision by a true, fair court,  he wrote.  It is clearly written there that the law and the right are on our side. It s them who are criminals, not me.  Navalny and his brother were convicted in December 2014 of money laundering and defrauding their business partners. Navalny was given a suspended sentence of 3-1/2 years and his brother a prison sentence of the same length. The Navalnys lodged a complaint with the ECHR in January 2015. The ECHR ruled that Russia must pay Navalny and his brother 10,000 euros ($12,000) each for non-pecuniary damage, plus costs and expenses of 45,000 euros for Alexei and 10,971 euros and 460,000 roubles ($8,000) for Oleg. In another case which Navalny says was a Kremlin attempt to prevent him standing for election, a Russian court in February found him guilty of embezzlement in relation to a timber firm called Kirovles and gave him a five-year suspended sentence. It was the second time the case had been heard, after the ECHR said Navalny s right to a fair hearing had been violated and ordered a retrial. ",

After listening to one veteran speak at length about his experience as a \u201cNavajo code talker\u201d during the war, Trump heaped praise on the veterans and said he would not give prepared remarks himself. \u201cYou were here long before any of us were here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAlthough we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago. They call her Pocahontas.\u201d Trump repeatedly referred to Warren as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d the name of a famous 17th-century Native American, during his presidential campaign in a mocking reference to Warren\u2019s having said in the past that she had Native American ancestry. Warren, one of the Senate\u2019s most prominent liberal Democrats, is a noted legal scholar who taught at Harvard Law School and served as an adviser to former President Barack Obama before she was elected to the Senate in 2012. \u201cIt is deeply unfortunate that the president of the United States cannot even make it through a ceremony honoring these heroes without having to throw out a racial slur,\u201d Warren said on MSNBC. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders disputed the characterization of Trump\u2019s remark as a racial slur. \u201cI think what most people find offensive is Senator Warren lying about her heritage to advance her career,\u201d Sanders told reporters. Jefferson Keel, president of the National Congress of American Indians, questioned the \u201cuse of the name Pocahontas as a slur ... Once again, we call upon the president to refrain from using her name in a way that denigrates her legacy.\u201d   Trump\u2019s comment immediately trended on social media. The word \u201cPocahontas\u201d appeared 12 times on Twitter every second, according to social media analytics company Zoomph. Trump\u2019s knock at Warren came as his administration is embroiled in controversy over the Consumer Financial Protection Board, which Warren helped develop before entering politics.  The agency, set up to protect Americans from abusive lending practices after the financial crisis, has been under attack by Trump since he took office in January. On Friday, Trump named his budget director as the interim head of the agency, after its outgoing chief named someone else to the job, setting up a court battle. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will meet for the first time on Tuesday with Speaker Paul Ryan, the top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, to discuss budget priorities and ways to work together this year, the White House said on Friday. The get-together with Ryan, which also will include Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, will provide a gauge of how much or how little legislative common ground the three leaders share as Obama completes his final year in office. \u201cWe certainly believe that there are areas of cooperation for the year ahead,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. It will be Obama\u2019s first formal face-to-face meeting with Ryan since he was elected speaker three months ago.  \u201cWhile the House is focused on a bold agenda for 2017, the speaker appreciates the opportunity to see if we can find any areas of common ground in the year ahead,\u201d Doug Andres, a spokesman for Ryan, said. During a closed-door meeting on Thursday with Democratic lawmakers, Obama said he does not expect Congress to get much done this year, according to an aide who was in the room. The White House has said there are only a few items on Obama\u2019s legislative wish-list that have any chance of passing through the Republican-controlled Congress. They include reforming mandatory minimum prison sentences for non-violent drug offenses and taking steps to address an epidemic of heroin addiction and prescription drug abuse. Obama also wants Congress to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, but he faces resistance from Democratic lawmakers concerned about the TPP\u2019s impact on jobs and the environment. The White House announced on Friday that Obama\u2019s top legislative aide Katie Beirne Fallon, who was popular among Republicans and Democrats alike on Capitol Hill, is leaving after helping Obama secure enough votes for fast-track trade negotiating authority, the Iran nuclear deal and a budget deal. Fallon will be replaced by her deputy Amy Rosenbaum, a former aide to House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. Obama\u2019s meeting with Republicans comes one week before Obama delivers his final budget proposal to Congress. It also comes as Obama tries to make good on a pledge he made during his 2008 campaign to close the U.S. detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama is set to deliver a plan to Congress about closing the prison that will include measures to house a small number of detainees in facilities in the United States.

        "title": "In shakeup, Trump to set up 'war room' to repel attacks over Russia probe",
        "text": "BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Once U.S. President Donald Trump returns from his overseas trip, the White House plans to launch its most aggressive effort yet to push back against allegations involving Russia and his presidential campaign, tackling head-on a scandal that has threatened to consume his young presidency. Trump\u2019s advisers are planning to establish a \u201cwar room\u201d to combat mounting questions about communication between Russia and his presidential campaign before and after November\u2019s presidential election, while bringing new aides into the White House, administration officials and persons close to Trump told Reuters. The strategic shake-up comes as Republicans in Washington increasingly have fretted that the probe, continued chaos in the West Wing and Trump\u2019s steady slide in opinion polls will derail the president\u2019s drive to reform healthcare, cut taxes and rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure. Upon Trump\u2019s return, the administration will add experienced political professionals, including Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, and possibly more lawyers to handle the Russia probe, which has gained new urgency since the Justice Department appointed a special counsel to head the investigation, the sources said. Beyond pushing back at suggestions that Moscow is unduly influencing Trump\u2019s administration, the messaging effort will also focus on advancing Trump\u2019s stalled policy agenda and likely involve more trips out of Washington that will feature the kind of raucous rallies that were the hallmark of Trump\u2019s campaign. A person in regular touch with the White House said it needed a different structure to focus on the \u201cnew reality\u201d that there would be continued leaks to the media from the law enforcement and intelligence communities, leaks that have increased in frequency since Trump fired former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey on May 9. \u201cSince the firing of Comey, that really exposed the fact that the White House in its current structure ... is not prepared for really a one-front war, let alone a two-front war,\u201d the person said. \u201cThey need to have a structure in place that allows them to stay focused\u201d while \u201calso truly fighting back on these attacks and these leaks.\u201d The White House declined to comment on plans for a \u201cwar room\u201d but said Trump will be looking to expand on momentum it believes it has built up during the president\u2019s trip to Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Europe.\u00a0A White House official confirmed plans to hold more rallies. Trump returns to Washington on Saturday from his first trip abroad as president. \u201cThe president has had an incredibly successful trip overseas and the White House looks forward to continuing an aggressive messaging strategy to highlight his agenda when we return to D.C.,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Trump, will be involved in the new strategic messaging operation, as will Steve Bannon, another top adviser who specializes in managing Trump\u2019s populist appeal and shaping his political image, the sources said. Bannon and Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, have been laying the groundwork for the plan this week, they added. On Thursday, NBC News and the Washington Post reported that Kushner, who held several meetings with Russian officials following the election, is a focus of the probe, making him the first current White House official to be caught up in it, although Kushner, who is Trump\u2019s son-in-law, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, is also expected to be part of the effort. Lewandowski, who has been seen in the White House recently, could join the administration as early as next week, a source close to him said. Lewandowski was fired by Trump in June 2016 over concerns that he was not experienced enough to oversee the general election fight against Democrat Hillary Clinton, but has remained a trusted adviser to Trump and a steadfast defender of the president on news programs. This month, the Justice Department named Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as an independent special counsel in the probe. Trump has been frustrated of late that his communications team hasn\u2019t done a more effective job at making the case that he isn\u2019t implicated in the Russia probe and highlighting his administration\u2019s successes, sources close to the president said. The White House declined to comment on the president\u2019s frustrations. Another Republican close to the White House said the new team is taking a page out of former President Bill Clinton\u2019s playbook. When Clinton faced impeachment in the late 1990s, he assembled a crisis-management operation that dealt with fallout from his affair with Monica Lewinsky while allowing the rest of the White House to deal with day-to-day policy matters.  \u201cThe goal of the White House is to try and contain the crisis and media coverage of the special counsel,\u201d the Republican said. Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media and a Trump friend, said he expects the president will travel more when he returns from overseas and encouraged the White House to focus on issues that pump up his base voters. \u201cFrom my perspective, I think the president should be doing the stuff that he does best, which is talking about his agenda: jobs, trade and security,\u201d Ruddy said.  Trump has scheduled a political rally for next week in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The White House said other similar events are in the planning stages. Republicans in Congress are aching for Trump to leave the distraction of the Russia probe aside and focus on legislation and nominating officials to fill the hundreds of vacant slots across the administration.  \u201cWhat we really want to be able to do is tend to our business,\u201d Mike Rounds, a Republican Senator from South Dakota, told Reuters. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a healthcare bill we\u2019re working on. We\u2019ve got tax reform that we think is important.\u201d Some of Trump\u2019s donors, too, say they are concerned. Stanley Hubbard, a billionaire radio mogul from Minnesota, said he worries that the White House continues to be distracted by the Russia scandal, but laid some of the blame on Trump himself.  \u201cHe talks when he shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. Former U.S. House Speaker John Boehner said this week that Trump\u2019s time in office has been a \u201ccomplete disaster\u201d aside from foreign affairs. Boehner, a fellow Republican, told an energy conference he supported efforts to \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of any potential interactions between Trump associates and the Russian government but described any calls to impeach Trump as the purview of \u201cthe crazy left-wing Democratic colleagues of mine.\u201d ",

        "title": "Trump stands by Obama wiretap charge, shrugs off row with Britain",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump stood by unproven claims on Friday that the Obama administration tapped his phones during the 2016 White House race and shrugged off a dispute with Britain over the notion their spy agency had a hand in it. British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s spokesman earlier in the day dismissed the charge against Britain\u2019s GCHQ spy agency as \u201cridiculous\u201d and said the White House had promised not to repeat it. But at a news conference Trump brushed aside a question about whether it was a mistake to accuse British intelligence of eavesdropping. \u201cWe said nothing. All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn\u2019t make an opinion on it,\u201d Trump said. He was referring to Fox News analyst Andrew Napolitano who on Tuesday accused Britain\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) intelligence agency of having helped Obama, a Democrat, wiretap Trump, a Republican.  White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Thursday quoted Napolitano\u2019s comments about GCHQ during a testy briefing with reporters. But speaking at the White House news conference, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, at his side, Trump distanced himself. \u201cThat was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox, and so you shouldn\u2019t be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox. OK?\u201d Trump said while standing by his initial charge that the previous U.S. administration eavesdropped on him. \u201cAs far as wiretapping, I guess by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps,\u201d he said to Merkel.  U.S. ties with Germany were frayed by news reports in 2013 citing leaked intelligence documents that Washington had bugged Merkel\u2019s mobile phone. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  said British officials had voiced concern to senior Trump aides but the official declined to explicitly apologize for Spicer\u2019s citation of the Fox News allegations. The Republican Trump, president since Jan. 20, tweeted this month that his Democratic predecessor had wiretapped him during the late stages of the 2016 campaign. Trump offered no evidence, and an Obama spokesman has said the claim is \u201csimply false\u201d. Leaders of both major parties in Congress have joined a growing chorus disputing it.  On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said it had responded to a request by committees in Congress for documents that could shed light on Trump\u2019s claim. A government source, who requested anonymity when discussing sensitive information, said an initial examination indicated it contained no evidence to support Trump\u2019s charge.  On the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d program, Napolitano, a political commentator and former New Jersey judge, said that rather than ordering U.S. agencies to spy on Trump, Obama had obtained transcripts of Trump\u2019s conversations from GCHQ so there were \u201cno American fingerprints\u201d on it. Late on Friday, Fox News anchor Shepard Smith said: \u201cFox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano\u2019s commentary. Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now president of the United States was surveilled at any time in any way, full stop.\u201d  Dominic Grieve, chairman of the British Parliament\u2019s Intelligence and Security Committee, said a U.S. president cannot task the GCHQ to intercept an individual\u2019s communications. In a rare public statement, the GCHQ, Britain\u2019s equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency which monitors overseas electronic communications, said the claims should be ignored. Reuters reported earlier this week that an unidentified British security official had denied the allegations about Trump. GCHQ, based in western England, is one of three main British spy agencies alongside the MI6 Secret Intelligence Service and the MI5 Security Service. ",

        "title": "U.S. Congress plans self-driving car legislation to speed rollout",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is working on national self-driving vehicle legislation that could replace state-by state rules and make it easier for automakers to test and deploy the technology, senior U.S. House and Senate lawmakers told Reuters on Tuesday. The chairman of the influential House Energy and Commerce Committee said he planned to unveil a package of legislation to overhaul federal rules governing self-driving vehicles. \u201cWe\u2019re getting very close. I think it\u2019s a good package. We\u2019ve put a lot of work into it,\u201d Representative Greg Walden of Oregon said in an interview, adding that there was \u201cgood bipartisan agreeement\u201d and he hoped to unveil and take up the package in the next month or two. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, is also working on a legislative self-driving proposal with Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet but we are getting closer,\u201d Thune said.  Thune and Walden spoke to Reuters on Tuesday after getting a ride in a self-driving Audi, a unit of Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE). Companies such as Alphabet Inc and Ford Motor Co are aggressively pursuing automated technologies and want unified federal regulations to replace outdated rules and make it simpler to develop and eventually sell the technology across the country. This spring, Republican staff drafted a summary of 16 potential legislative proposals on federal reforms and regulations that they circulated to automakers and which was seen by Reuters.  Among proposals under consideration is one to allow the U.S. Transportation Department to exempt up to 100,000 autonomous vehicles from current safety standards, which were written on the assumption responsibility for a car\u2019s operation rested with the human driver. The existing motor vehicle safety standards bar the sale of vehicles without steering wheels and gas pedals, for example. Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo unit has called for those rules  be changed. Another proposal would prohibit a state from restricting testing by a manufacturer of up to 250 vehicles and comes as automakers have sparred with California over revisions to its self-driving car testing rules.  Thune said he planned to hold a hearing on June 14 about self-driving car issues but did not put a specific timetable on introducing legislation. He said he wanted to avoid a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of regulations from 50 different states on self-driving cars and look at cybersecurity and other issues. \u201cThe key thing is to make sure we stay in the lead on the innovation that there aren\u2019t unnecessary roadblocks in the way, balancing that with safety,\u201d Walden said. On Monday, the U.S. Transportation Department said it would unveil revised self-driving guidelines within the next few months, responding to automakers\u2019 calls for regulations to sanction costly efforts to put autonomous vehicles on the road. The voluntary guidelines would provide direction to states on self-driving cars as Congress works to set more permanent rules to oversee autonomous vehicles. But legislation might not be approved this year and states and automakers are eager for guidance from regulators in the interim. Vehicle crashes annually kill more than 35,000 people on U.S. roads and injure 2.4 million. Walden said the goal was to get self-driving cars on the roads in big numbers so in a generation people would say: \u201c\u2018What a bunch of barbarians - they drove themselves? Are you kidding me? And look at how many died every year and they thought that was acceptable?\u2019\u201d ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Makan Delrahim, who was chosen by President Donald Trump to be the top U.S. antitrust regulator, said on Wednesday that he would maintain independence from the White House in enforcing antitrust law. The Senate must still vote to confirm Delrahim. In a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee overshadowed by repercussions over Trump\u2019s firing of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, Delrahim reiterated that he would recuse himself from a fight over whether health insurer Anthem may merge with rival Cigna. Delrahim had worked for Anthem as a lobbyist when he was with the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP. Obama\u2019s Justice Department sued to stop the deal, and the case is currently under appeal. Asked what he would do if the White House wanted to discuss a deal being considered by the division, Delrahim said antitrust enforcement was law enforcement. \u201cThe independence of the decisions made in prosecuting and reviewing mergers as well as other conduct is a serious one that should be free from any political influence,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be free if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed.\u201d Delrahim currently works in the White House as deputy assistant and deputy counsel to the president. If confirmed as expected, Delrahim\u2019s antitrust division would review corporate mergers at a time when many investors and corporate executives are anticipating a more relaxed view of deal-making. Former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration faced a large number of megadeals in what one enforcer called a \u201cmerger tsunami\u201d and blocked many of them. Antitrust experts who have followed Delrahim\u2019s career expect him to follow in the footsteps of a former boss, Hewitt Pate, who was assistant attorney general for antitrust from 2003 to 2005. Delrahim was Pate\u2019s deputy, specializing in international antitrust. Under Pate, the division was criticized for allowing too many deals, but it sued to stop US Airways from merging with United Airlines and blocked a deal to combine DirecTV and EchoStar. It tried but failed to stop Oracle Corp from buying PeopleSoft. If confirmed, Delrahim would oversee the Justice Department\u2019s assessment of AT&T\u2019s Inc plan to buy Time Warner Inc, the owner of HBO, Warner Brothers and news network CNN.  The department is reviewing major transactions in seeds and agricultural chemicals, like the mergers of Dow Chemical Co and Dupont, and of Bayer and Monsanto. Those proposed deals, along with ChemChina\u2019s purchase of Syngenta, would consolidate six agricultural chemical companies into three. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two months after signing it, President Donald Trump has not begun enforcing a law imposing new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea, Senators John McCain and Ben Cardin said in a letter seen by Reuters on Friday. Also, with just two days to go, his administration has not provided information related to Russia\u2019s defense and intelligence sectors required under the measure by Sunday, they said. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment on the letter from McCain, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. Later on Friday, the White House issued a presidential memorandum taking the first step toward implementation by designating different agencies to start the process putting the law into effect. Trump grudgingly signed the \u201cCountering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act\u201d on Aug. 2 after Congress overwhelmingly approved the measure despite Trump\u2019s reservations about how it might affect his desire for improved relations with Moscow. The White House had hedged for weeks, as the legislation worked its way through Congress, over whether the president would sign it or use his veto power. Although his fellow Republicans control Congress, it passed both the Senate and House of Representatives by near-unanimous margins large enough to override a veto. Trump\u2019s opposition to the law had raised questions about how enthusiastically his administration would enforce it. \u201cCongress\u2019 swift and united action, and your signature, sent a strong message to our allies and adversaries alike, and particularly to those such as Russia, who have sought to undermine our democracy,\u201d said the letter, dated Thursday. \u201cNow, as critical deadlines are approaching, it is imperative that your Administration implement the law to its fullest extent to uphold and protect American interests,\u201d it said. The law imposed stiff new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea over issues including Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election, which Russia denies, as well as Iran\u2019s ballistic missiles program and North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons development. The administration in particular opposed a provision that would not let Trump, or any president, ease or lift sanctions on Russia without Congress\u2019 approval. The letter also noted the Oct. 1 deadline for the administration to issue \u201cregulations or other guidance\u201d to identify anyone who is operating on behalf of the Russian defense and intelligence sectors for potential sanctions.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House officials said on Friday they did not know yet whether President Donald Trump would seek to block former FBI Director James Comey from testifying to Congress next week, a move that could spark a political backlash. \u201cI have not spoken to counsel yet. I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to respond,\u201d White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters. Comey was leading a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into alleged Russian meddling in last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by Trump\u2019s campaign when the president fired him last month. Critics have charged that Trump was seeking to hinder the FBI\u2019s investigation by dismissing Comey. The former FBI chief is due to testify on Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee as part of its own Russia-related investigation, and his remarks could cause problems for the Republican president. Comey is widely expected to be asked about conversations in which the president reportedly pressured him to drop an investigation into Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, whose ties to Russia are under scrutiny. Critics have said that such pressure could potentially amount to obstruction of justice. Presidents can assert executive privilege to prevent government employees from sharing information. However, legal experts say it is not clear whether certain conversations between Trump and Comey that the president has talked about publicly would be covered, and any effort to block Comey, who is now a private citizen, from testifying could be challenged in court. Democratic lawmakers sent White House counsel Donald McGahn a letter warning that invoking executive privilege \u201cwould be seen as an effort to obstruct the truth from both Congress and the American people.\u201d  In an interview with ABC News, White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway appeared to indicate the president would allow Comey to testify. \u201cWe\u2019ll be watching with the rest of the world when Director Comey testifies,\u201d she said. But asked directly whether Trump would invoke executive privilege on Comey\u2019s testimony, she added: \u201cThe president will make that decision.\u201d Amid a political firestorm touched off by Comey\u2019s firing, the Justice Department appointed a special counsel last month to take the lead on the Russia investigation. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded the Russian government sought to influence the U.S. election in Trump\u2019s favor, a charge Russia has denied. Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, said on Thursday some Russians may have acted on their own. Trump, who has raised doubts about the U.S. agencies\u2019 findings and denounced the continuing Russia probes, has denied any collusion. ",

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warns failure to curb North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile development could lead to \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d while China and Russia rebuke Washington for its threat of force. Trump signs a bill approved by the Republican-led Congress to avert a U.S. government shutdown and give lawmakers another week to work out federal spending through Sept. 30, with tricky issues like defense spending still unresolved. Trump pledges to uphold Americans\u2019 right to possess guns in a speech that he uses to revisit some 2016 election campaign themes from his vow to build a border wall to dismissing Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren as \u201cPocahontas.\u201d Trump tells Reuters he will either renegotiate or terminate what he calls a \u201chorrible\u201d free trade deal with South Korea and says Seoul should pay for a U.S. anti-missile system he prices at $1 billion. A 5-year-old U.S.-South Korean trade deal could be improved to increase access for American vehicles and deter currency manipulation but changes will not necessarily shrink the U.S. trade deficit with the Asian export powerhouse.

A U.S. appeals court grants a Trump administration request to put on hold a legal challenge by industry and a group of states to Obama administration regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants, rules Trump is moving to undo.

Russia has denied meddling in the U.S. election, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. U.S. congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller are investigating the allegations.     The Federal Election Commission last week sought public comment on possible regulatory changes, and the commission is considering holding a public hearing, with Facebook and other tech companies as invited witnesses.  Facebook has said it is working with U.S. authorities who are investigating alleged Russian meddling and also taking steps, such as removing fake accounts, to prevent manipulation of its platform.

        "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Reuters) - Work to avert the problems caused by climate change should not be a partisan issue, outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry told students at an elite U.S. engineering school on Monday, in one of his final speeches as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. Kerry noted U.S. officials from military and intelligence leaders to the mayors of coastal cities agree the problem of rising sea levels and erratic rainfall is one that they want to take action on, and he urged the incoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump to tackle head on. Trump, a New York real estate developer who has never held elected office, has described climate change as a hoax and vowed to pull the United States out of the deal negotiated in Paris in 2015 to cut global greenhouse gas emissions. But in an interview with the New York Times in November, Trump said he was keeping an open mind on whether to pull out of the accord. \u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate about the policies that our President-elect and his Secretary of State will choose to pursue, but I will tell you this ... some issues look a lot different when you\u2019re actually in office compared to when you\u2019re on the campaign trail,\u201d Kerry said at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.  \u201cThe truth is that climate change shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue. It\u2019s an issue that all of us should care about, regardless of political affiliation.\u201d The U.S. Senate this week is due to begin the process of confirming Trump\u2019s political appointments, including proposed Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, who has repeatedly challenged the agency\u2019s authority in the courts. Many Republicans in Congress argue environmental regulations slow business growth and job creation, both expected to be top priorities for the Trump administration. Kerry referenced a U.S. intelligence report published on Monday that listed climate change among the factors that could raise the risk of conflict between nations. Obama on Monday echoed the message in an article published in Science magazine.  Kerry called on researchers and students at MIT to keep up their work on improving energy efficiency and inventing new energy sources, regardless of government policies. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be innovators, researchers, entrepreneurs, and business leaders ... who will continue to create the technological advances that forever revolutionize the way we power our world,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cEvery person in this room \u2013 indeed, every person on the planet \u2013 has an interest in making sure that transition happens as quickly as possible.\u201d ",

        "title": "Democrats rising? Early statehouse wins test new faces",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Democrats desperate to rebuild after losing the White House last year have scored a string of election victories for statehouse seats, testing a new generation of candidates and activists eager to resist President Donald Trump\u2019s conservative agenda. From New Hampshire to Oklahoma, Democrats have flipped eight Republican-held seats in special legislative elections, having spent millions of dollars on low-turnout contests mostly being fought over local issues. The wins showcase how Democrats want to fight back after losing to Trump and hitting historic lows in statehouses. But the party faces challenges carrying this momentum into the 2018 midterm elections when thousands of seats are at stake, interviews with nearly two dozen Democratic leaders, campaigns and other political experts show. \u201cCan we recruit enough capable candidates, and can we run enough modern races?\u201d asked Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic political strategist. He said the party must test its future leaders in real time. \u201cAre they ready? The answer is: We don\u2019t know.\u201d In November, Democrats will get an early read.  One critical test is in Washington state, where first-time candidate Manka Dhingra is running for an up-for-grabs senate seat in Seattle\u2019s suburbs. A victory on Nov. 7 would give Democrats full control of the state. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A prosecutor and school parent volunteer, Dhingra is a Sikh Indian American whose political awakening began with businessman Trump\u2019s surprise election victory over experienced politician Hillary Clinton. Still, Dhingra steers clear of mentioning the president in her pitch to swing voters. \u201cThe Trump reaction, the way it works is by invigorating volunteers,\u201d Dhingra said. \u201cThere are a lot of people, like myself, who decided we cannot be bystanders.\u201d Nearly 2,000 volunteers have signed up through her campaign website alone, evidence of what the party calls unprecedented interest in legislative contests.  An August primary, where Dhingra finished 10 points ahead of her Republican competitor, had a relatively robust turnout, including nearly 6,000 voters who normally skip primaries. Outside of Washington state, however, a few Democratic wins  will do little to change the political map going into the 2018 midterm elections. Republicans control 26 state governments and two-thirds of legislative chambers. Democrats hemorrhaged power at the state level during President Barack Obama\u2019s eight years in office with their attention on national elections. Now Democrats see the states as critical for rebuilding, and an opportunity to advance legislation pushing back against Trump\u2019s agenda of gutting Democratic health care reforms and environmental protections and cracking down on immigration. The party plans to recruit hundreds of thousands of volunteers to contact more than 30 million voters - double their outreach in statehouse contests in the 2016 presidential cycle.  \u201cBecause of the gridlock in Washington, people are turning to statehouses for security from Donald Trump,\u201d said Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. But the party\u2019s many inexperienced candidates must beat battle-tested incumbents in elections next year with greater voter turnout. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf the Democrats have every bit of momentum and the wildest day they could think of, they may take us from super majorities to majorities,\u201d said David Avella, chairman of the Republican group GOPAC. \u201cBut we will still have majorities.\u201d Democrats have flipped legislative seats in Florida, Oklahoma, New Hampshire and New York in 2017. Republicans picked up an uncontested seat in Louisiana. In Oklahoma, where Trump won 65 percent of the vote in the 2016 general election, the Democrats flipped three seats in districts he carried. Candidates doubled down on local issues, such as a budget crisis forcing four-day school weeks. They had a chance to \u201crepresent themselves as real people that weren\u2019t actually attached to Nancy Pelosi, or Hillary Clinton, or Barack Obama,\u201d said Anna Langthorn, Oklahoma Democratic Party chairwoman. Some of the special elections success reflects startup progressive groups rallying voters. But they have yet to figure out how to expand their scope for 2018. Chris Walsh, a cofounder of Flippable, which is working to win back state governments, went to Florida last month to help Democrat Annette Taddeo beat a Republican former legislator who once competed on Trump\u2019s reality TV show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d \u201cThere is a lot of knowledge out there that is siloed,\u201d Walsh said, adding the party could help by sharing information such as district voting data with new groups.  This year\u2019s most revealing contests will come in a statewide election in Virginia, where Democrats face a long-shot bid in November to pick up 17 seats and take back the House of Delegates. In a show of enthusiasm to rebuild, the party is fielding a ticket that is more than 50 percent larger than two years ago. Yet fewer than one in four of the mostly women vying for Republican-held seats have raised more money than their competitors, Virginia Public Access Project data showed. Republicans are also ramping up in defense. They anticipate state contests will be central to Democratic efforts in 2018, given their longer odds of reclaiming the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Democrats are trying to probe for the weakest link, and they are looking for that at the state level,\u201d said Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee. \u201cIt is our job to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d ",

        "title": "Factbox: Trump's government shutdown threat, looming debt ceiling",
        "text": "(Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was willing to shut down the government to get funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, complicating two must-pass measures Congress will take up in September: a spending package and raising the debt ceiling. Here is what you need to know about both, and the potential for a shutdown of the U.S. government: Congress must pass annual spending bills around the end of the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30 to fund much of the U.S. government. When disagreements prevent that, which is frequent, lawmakers often pass a temporary bill extending existing spending levels with no changes for days, weeks or months, while they work on a longer-lasting deal. When they cannot agree on either a new spending plan or a short-term extension, the government shuts down. That has happened many times since the 1970s, usually for a few days, and can rattle markets. Congress will return from its long summer recess on Sept. 5. At the time, it will have only about 12 working days to approve spending measures to keep the government open. If spending measures are not passed before Oct. 1, portions of the government will begin to shut down and non-essential employees will go without pay until an agreement is reached. The government most recently shut down for about two weeks in October 2013 over funding for former President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law. There were three shutdowns in the 1990s, the longest lasting 21 days. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were 14 shutdowns, some partial and most lasting only a few days. The \u201cdebt ceiling\u201d is a legislative limit on how much money the federal government can borrow through debt issued by the U.S. Treasury. Once the limit is reached, Congress must raise it or the government cannot continue borrowing money and would default, or be unable to pay its bills. The Treasury has said it wants Congress to increase the debt ceiling by Sept. 29, although default likely could be staved off until mid-October, thanks to \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d the Treasury put in place in March to delay a debt reckoning.   Legislation to raise the debt limit will need to be adopted, at the very latest, by early to mid-October. If the debt ceiling is not raised, the government would not be able to borrow more money or pay its bills, including payments on its debts, which could hurt the U.S. credit rating. Political gridlock has never led to the United States reaching its debt ceiling and its bills going unpaid, but there have been close calls. An August 2011 standoff cost the country its top-notch bond rating from the credit rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s and caused the most jarring two weeks in financial markets since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. The two move on separate tracks, but are likely to get tangled together, with Republican opponents of a debt ceiling increase likely demanding federal spending cuts. Some analysts say Congress may try to tackle both issues at the same time. Both the spending and debt ceiling bills can pass the Republican-led House of Representatives by a simple majority vote, but will need 60 votes to pass the Senate, where Republicans hold 52 of 100 seats, meaning they will need some Democratic support.  Trump made his U.S.-Mexico border wall a central promise of his 2016 presidential campaign. He also promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, but Mexico has steadfastly refused and Trump has largely stopped talking about that pledge. Conservative House Republicans agree with the Republican president on the need for a wall and say border-wall funding should be a priority in any spending legislation. Some of them have already indicated they are willing to shut down the government to get it. Moderate Republicans have called a shutdown unwise and Republican leaders are determined to prevent one, fearing it would worsen doubts about the party\u2019s ability to govern. Democrats are uniformly opposed to Trump\u2019s wall and say the responsibility for a shutdown would rest solely with Republicans. The Trump administration reversed course earlier this month and said it would back a \u201cclean\u201d raising of the debt ceiling, meaning it would not be tied to other policy measures. Democrats and moderate Republicans also support a clean debt-ceiling increase. But conservative Republicans, especially in the House, often use debt-ceiling legislation to insist on changes to spending, making them opposed to a clean bill. ",

        "title": "Trump warns of government shutdown threat ahead of meeting with lawmakers",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday again raised the possibility of a U.S. government shutdown - blaming Democrats for that possible outcome - one day before he is due to host Republican and Democratic congressional leaders for talks on spending bills. Trump and Congress are facing a deadline of Friday at midnight to pass fresh spending legislation. If they cannot agree on the terms, parts of the federal government could shut down. Late on Wednesday, a bill advanced in the House of Representatives to extend current federal funding through Dec. 22, with the chamber expected to take up the bill on Thursday. If that measure clears the House and Senate, as expected, major fights are in the offing over the next funding bill, which could fund the government until sometime in January. Trump\u2019s warning about a shutdown came as conservative House members pushed for increases in military spending along with either a freeze or reduction in domestic programs. Their bid is likely to be rejected by Democrats, who make up a minority in Congress, and could further complicate months of behind-the-scenes negotiations by congressional leaders aimed at figuring out government spending through the end of this fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2018. While the House potentially could pass upcoming spending bills without any Democratic support, that tactic would not work in the Senate where procedural rules give Democrats bargaining power. As a condition of backing new spending, many Democrats have demanded legislative protections for the nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought into the United States as children. Trump pushed back, saying it could set the stage for impasse. \u201cThe Democrats are really looking at something that is very dangerous for our country,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cThey are looking at shutting down.\u201d House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi countered in a tweet: \u201cPresident Trump is the only person talking about a government shutdown. Democrats are hopeful the president will be open to an agreement to address the urgent needs of the American people and keep government open.\u201d The infighting came as Republican congressional leaders labored to demonstrate that they can govern and spare the country the chaos of a government shutdown at Christmas time that likely would not sit well with voters. A partial government shutdown would leave \u201cessential\u201d services operating, but could disrupt programs ranging from the operation of national parks to educational programs and scientific research. A Politico/Morning Consult opinion poll found that 63 percent of voters want Congress to avoid any shutdown, with 18 percent in favor if it helps lawmakers achieve policy goals. In October 2013, conservative Republicans used the need to pass a funding bill to try to force repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. They failed but in the process forced a 17-day disruption of many federal agency activities. The end-of-year fight over appropriations, which should have been settled nine weeks ago, is attracting a series of controversial add-ons from both Republicans and Democrats. Republicans want to add as much as tens of billions of dollars to military spending this year and impose new work requirements for some recipients of Medicaid benefits, the healthcare program for the poor and disabled. Democrats want to attach the immigration measure and a restoration of Obamacare subsidy payments for low-income people that Trump terminated. Both parties seek additional disaster aid for Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida and other states. Republican Representatives Mark Meadows, who heads the House Freedom Caucus, and Representative Mark Walker, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, are touting the effort to pump up Pentagon spending without any increases to non-defense programs. But Democrats have argued that inaction on the non-defense side of the ledger would usher in a new round of automatic spending cuts for those programs next month, short-changing programs that fight opioid addiction, fund medical research, veterans programs and an array of other activities.

        "title": "Trump adviser joined key party meeting on Ukraine",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A foreign policy adviser to U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump confirmed his attendance at a meeting last month during which the Republican Party agreed to watered-down language in its support of Ukraine. J. D. Gordon, the adviser who previously served as a Pentagon spokesman, said that while he was present during the meeting at the Republican National Convention, he sat at a side table with staff and was not among the delegates charged with shaping the Ukraine platform. But one delegate in attendance, Diana Denman, said Gordon told her he was going to speak with Trump during the debate over the platform\u2019s language on Ukraine, saying she believed Trump\u2019s campaign played a direct role in softening the party\u2019s support for Ukraine at a time of heightened tensions with Russia. The Trump campaign has denied it played any role in the weakening of the party\u2019s position regarding Ukraine. Gordon called Denman\u2019s version of events \u201cinaccurate.\u201d  Stephen Yates, co-chair of the national security subcommittee, confirmed that Trump campaign members were present at the meeting where Ukraine language for the RNC platform was discussed. But he said only delegates participated in the debate and denied the Trump campaign played any role in softening the Ukraine language. The details of the meeting in Cleveland have attracted scrutiny and raised questions about the Trump campaign\u2019s stance toward Russia. Trump has said he would seek to build a closer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, praising him as a stronger leader than U.S. President Barack Obama. In the last month, Trump has also suggested he might not defend NATO allies if they did not spend more on defense, appeared to invite Russia to hack the emails of Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton and suggested he might accept Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Denman, a member of the platform committee\u2019s national security subcommittee, said she proposed language that supported \u201cproviding lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine\u2019s armed forces and greater coordination with NATO on defense planning.\u201d That phrase was eventually changed to remove the reference to \u201clethal defensive weapons.\u201d In the end, the platform, which serves as a largely symbolic statement of the party\u2019s priorities, criticizes the Obama administration for encouraging a \u201cresurgent Russia\u201d and supports continued sanctions on Moscow and \u201cappropriate assistance to the armed forces of the Ukraine\u201d without specifying what that would involve. Yates said Denman could have reintroduced the amendment in the full committee meeting if she felt strong-armed in subcommittee. \u201cI don\u2019t have particular sympathy for delegates who chose not to avail themselves of the opportunity in full committee, and then start spinning yarn about how this came about,\u201d he said. Denman said she stands by her account. Russia on Thursday announced it would conduct war games in the Black Sea, a day after Putin accused Ukraine of trying to provoke a conflict over Crimea. ",

        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will not meet President Vladimir Putin when he visits Moscow on Wednesday, a move that could point to tensions over a U.S. missile attack on a Syrian air base last week. John Kerry, Tillerson\u2019s predecessor, often met Putin as well as the Russian foreign minister when he visited Moscow, and Putin granted several audiences to the Texan when he ran oil major Exxon Mobil before taking his current job. Putin even personally awarded Tillerson a top Russian state award \u2014 the Order of Friendship \u2014 in 2013, and it was widely expected that the former oilman would meet Putin on what is his first trip to Russia as secretary of state. But Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Monday that no such meeting was planned, suggesting Tillerson will follow strict diplomatic protocol and only meet his direct counterpart, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. \u201cWe have not announced any such meetings and right now there is no meeting with Tillerson in the president\u2019s diary,\u201d Peskov told reporters on a conference call. He did not say why Putin was not planning to receive Tillerson. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian military base last week in retaliation for what Washington and its allies say was a poisonous gas attack in which scores of civilians were killed. Moscow says there is no proof that the Syrian military carried out the attack, and called the U.S. missile strike an act of aggression that violates international law.   Tillerson\u2019s visit is being seen as an early test of whether Trump\u2019s new administration can use any momentum generated by striking the Syrian base to craft and execute a strategy to end the war there. Even before Trump ordered the strike in retaliation for a nerve gas attack, Tillerson\u2019s visit was certain to be dominated by thorny issues. Those include alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Washington\u2019s accusation that Russia is violating an important arms control treaty, and trying to bridge differences on how to conduct the fight against Islamic State. Syria, ironically, was one of the few areas where analysts believed Moscow and Washington might be able to find common ground. Peskov, Putin\u2019s spokesman, said on Monday that the U.S. strikes had shown Washington\u2019s total unwillingness to cooperate on Syria. Reacting to media reports that Tillerson would use his visit to press Moscow to back away from supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Russia\u2019s biggest Middle East ally, Peskov signaled that was a non-starter. \u201cReturning to pseudo-attempts to resolve the crisis by repeating mantras that Assad must step down cannot help sort things out.\u201d ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Friday named 39 Russian defense- and intelligence-related entities under a new sanctions law, belatedly taking a step to enforce legislation passed overwhelmingly by Congress. The law, which President Donald Trump signed on Aug. 2, requires sanctions on individuals who engage in \u201ca significant transaction\u201d with the Russian entities. Friday\u2019s action does not itself impose new sanctions, and determinations will be made on a case by case basis, State Department officials said. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have complained that Trump has been tardy in enforcing the law, which required the list of Russian entities be ready by Oct. 1. The list includes major Russian arms makers as well as Rosoboronexport, the state-run Russian arms exporter. Also listed is the St. Petersburg-based Special Technology Center, which former President Barack Obama sanctioned in December, saying it played a role in Moscow\u2019s hacking and other interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russia has denied such meddling. State Department officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, indicated the Trump administration would move carefully in imposing sanctions and dealing with issues such as U.S. allies who buy Russian-made weaponry or spare parts. \u201cThere is a significance threshold that would exclude certain things that are less than significant,\u201d one official said. \u201cObviously we\u2019re going to consider the totality of circumstances.\u201d State Department guidance released on Friday says that in determining whether a transaction is \u201csignificant,\u201d officials would weigh its impact on U.S. national security; its size and scope; and the importance of the deal to Russia\u2019s defense and intelligence sector. The law requires Trump to impose sanctions by Jan. 29 on transactions that are found to meet the definition and which took place after he signed the legislation in August. \u201cWe\u2019ll be implementing the sanctions legislation robustly, in keeping with our understanding of Congress\u2019 intent and the facts that precipitated that legislation, including interference in our election,\u201d a second State Department official said. The same official did not dispute a report that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had eliminated a department office charged with coordinating economic sanctions. The office traditionally had been led by a senior U.S. diplomat. The official added that individuals throughout the department work on sanctions and that coordination of such work would continue. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. Senate were dealt another blow in their effort to repeal Obamacare on Friday when the keeper of the Senate\u2019s rules said certain provisions in their healthcare bill, such as defunding Planned Parenthood, could not be included. The Senate parliamentarian determined some provisions in the Better Care Reconciliation Act violate the Byrd Rule that requires backers to be able to muster 60 votes, according to a memo posted on the Senate Committee on the Budget website. Republicans, who control the Senate with a slim 52-seat majority, are unlikely to be able to round up that many votes for key provisions in the bill to repeal former President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare.     Affected would be the provision to defund Planned Parenthood, two provisions to prevent certain tax credits from being used to purchase health insurance that covers abortion, and a provision stating that beginning in 2020 states no longer have to cover essential health benefits in their Medicaid alternative benefit plans. Some provisions were not subject to the Byrd Rule, according to the parliamentarian, including a provision allowing states the option to impose work requirements on Medicaid enrollees who are not disabled, elderly or pregnant, and a proposal to repeal cost-sharing subsidies. Other provisions were still under review, including a proposal to allow insurers to charge older Americans more than younger people, a provision to allow small businesses to establish \u201cassociation health plans\u201d that could be sold across state lines and the option for states to receive Medicaid \u201cblock grant\u201d lump sums instead of per capita cap payments.

A White House budget official said on Monday that Trump would seek to boost military spending by $54 billion and cut the same amount from non-defense spending, including a large reduction in foreign aid.

        "title": "Supreme Court's recent unity faces looming test",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the U.S. Supreme Court navigated a difficult period in which it was short one member for more than a year, justices from across the ideological spectrum often managed to find common ground. That sense of unity promises to be soon put to the test. The nine-justice court ended its 2016-2017 term on Monday with a flurry of rulings. When it resumes work in October, its recently restored conservative majority could become more assertive as the justices tackle big cases on whether the U.S. Constitution lets businesses refuse to serve gay couples for religious reasons, presidential powers and manipulating electoral district boundaries for partisan gain. Neil Gorsuch, Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s appointee, joined the court in April, giving conservatives a 5-4 majority. Gorsuch already has established himself as among the most conservative and outspoken justices even before beginning his first full term.  \u201cWe will certainly see more cases where they are sharply divided,\u201d Chicago-Kent College of Law professor Carolyn Shapiro said. While partisan tensions in Washington have deepened since Trump took office in January, the Supreme Court largely remained above the fray. In the 14 months that the court operated with only eight justices following Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death and was divided equally between liberals and conservative, it showed greater unanimity in its decisions than in recent years. During that time, the justices often sidestepped major rulings on divisive issues, resolving several cases narrowly and trying to avoid 4-4 votes that would leave legal questions unresolved.  The court even avoided a sharp ideological split in its decision on Monday on how to handle Trump\u2019s contentious order banning people from six Muslim majority countries from entering the United States. The four liberal justices were silent as the court allowed parts of the order to go into effect and agreed to decide the legality of the policy in its next term. The court already has agreed to hear several major cases in which the justices are likely to be divided on ideological lines, including one on the conflict between gay rights and religious freedom concerning a Christian baker from Colorado who refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple, citing his religious beliefs. The justices will also weigh whether state legislative districts violate constitutional protections if they are drawn purely to gain partisan advantage in a case involving a Republican-configured electoral map in Wisconsin that could have major consequences for U.S. elections. The travel ban case, Trump\u2019s first big Supreme Court battle, is a major test of presidential powers, with Trump\u2019s administration arguing that the judiciary should show deference to the president on national security matters. In the term that just ended, the court was able to decide all but two of the cases it heard. On Monday, the justices ordered that those cases, both on immigration-related issues, be re-argued in its next term, when Gorsuch would be able to participate. The action suggests the court was divided 4-4 along ideological grounds on those cases. A review of rulings from the 2016-2017 term compared with previous years shows a higher rate of unanimity, likely prompted by the greater need for compromise without a decisive ninth vote. In 69 cases in which the court issued decisions on the merits, there were no dissenting votes in 41 of them, or 59 percent, according to Kedar Bhatia, who compiles court statistics for the SCOTUSblog website. That compares with 44 percent in the court\u2019s previous term and 40 percent in the one prior to that.  \u201cWith only eight members, I think the court was trying harder to achieve as much agreement as possible, both in the close cases and in the not-so-close ones,\u201d said Kannon Shanmugam, a lawyer who regularly argues before the court. While they were shorthanded, the justices took up fewer cases that were likely to divide them ideologically. For example, they took six cases on patent protections, a higher-than-normal number, on an issue in which they usually are unanimous. ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s campaign defended comments he made on combat veterans and mental health on Monday, after some said his remarks implied service members diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were weak. At an event with veterans in Herndon, Virginia, Trump called for better mental health services for those returning from combat, saying that while many are \u201cstrong,\u201d others \u201ccan\u2019t handle\u201d what they have seen on the battlefield. The response struck some as insulting to veterans struggling with PTSD, as the Republican candidate works to motivate traditionally conservative military voters to support him in the Nov. 8 presidential election. Retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, a Trump adviser on military issues, said in a written statement that the candidate\u2019s comments were taken out of context \u201cin order to deceive voters and veterans.\u201d Marine Staff Sergeant Chad Robichaux, whose question at the event prompted Trump\u2019s statement, said the critical reaction was \u201csickening\u201d and accused others of manipulating Trump\u2019s words. \u201cI took his comments to be thoughtful and understanding of the struggles many veterans have,\u201d said Robichaux, an Afghanistan combat veteran who has been diagnosed with PTSD. Trump made his remarks at an event hosted by a political action committee called Retired American Warriors. Trump has cast himself a champion of veterans during his campaign and in July pledged to reform federal programs for war veterans. He attended a military preparatory school but did not serve in the U.S. military.

Seventy-three percent of the 978 people surveyed said Macron defended the country s interests well, a 5 percent rise from November. The jump in popularity also comes at a time when the French right is more fractured than at almost any point in the modern-day Fifth Republic, leaving opposition to Macron negligible. On the negative side, 57 percent of people said they believed that Macron was not in tune with the concerns of the French. The poll, carried out between December 1-2, said that some 42 percent of people saw the far-left Insoumise party as the main opposition to Macron compared to just 22 percent for the conservative The Republicans and 21 percent for the far-right National Front.

The comments can be found at the following web sites: here and here Here is a selection of some of their suggestions: * GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING RULE - Modify the U.S. Clean Air Act\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Reporting rule to create incentives for carbon capture and storage technology, in which carbon dioxide emissions are captured and stored underground. * STACK TESTING - Eliminate redundant stack testing currently required under parts of the U.S. Clean Air Act. * ONCE IN-ALWAYS IN - Eliminate a provision of the U.S. Clean Air Act that requires a major source of emissions to always be treated as a major source, even if it later adds technology to reduce those emissions. This change was also requested by other groups, including the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute. * NEW SOURCE REVIEW - Modify the New Source Review permitting process required under the U.S. Clean Air Act to eliminate the need to consider emissions increases from non-modified affected emission units at a plant, and allow \u201cproject netting\u201d that accounts for emissions reductions elsewhere at a plant. * NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS - Review an EPA decision to tighten ozone standards in a way that would likely expose more company facilities to tougher Clean Air Act rules. * RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD - Ensure average mandated ethanol content in gasoline does not exceed 9.7 percent of projected U.S. demand. * RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD - Ensure EPA continues to boost the mandated volumes of biofuels in gasoline and other road fuels. * AIR PERMITS: Reduce the burden of air and ozone permitting regulation to make it easier to greenlight projects. * EPA TRANSPARENCY: Increase the transparency of the science EPA relies upon in its rule-making. * NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: \u201cStreamline specific NSPS and NESHAP regulations to eliminate redundant requirements, conflicts between rules, and undue complexity, resulting in practical and understandable regulations without reduced protection of the environment.\u201d * NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: Review rules seeking to limit fugitive emissions from oil and gas installations. * NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS: Like AFPM and others, IPAA wants a review of planned tightening of ozone standards that could ramp up regulatory burdens.   * MORE COLLABORATIVE ENFORCEMENT: \u201cEPA needs to thoroughly review and revise its federal enforcement process. It needs to create an enforcement program that treats the regulated community with fairness, respect and dignity.\u201d * NEW SOURCE REVIEW: \u201cThere continues to be a need for NSR reforms that simplify and streamline permitting.\u201d * NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS: Review various aspects of ozone standards and enforcement to ease regulatory burdens.  * GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING RULE - Require less frequent, and less arduous reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. * NEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: Reconsider aspects of this regulation, including those requiring a New Source Review permit for a plant undergoing any modification - \u201can enormous additional environmental review process that stifles modernization and efficiency upgrades.\u201d * FINANCIAL ASSURANCE FOR HARD ROCK MINING: Eliminate EPA rule that would require an increase in funds available to reclaim post-mining sites. * ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT: Overturn \u201cmisuse of the Endangered Species Act which has put 10 million acres across a few western states off limits from mining.\u201d ",

The latest order sought a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Trump\u2019s administration has said it would appeal after a federal judge struck down parts of the ban on the day it was set to go into effect. ",

        "text": "GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Militia fighters in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo attacked a U.N. peacekeeping base on Friday, triggering clashes that left two of the fighters dead and two peacekeepers slightly wounded, the U.N. mission said. Thirty-four rebels from a Mai-Mai militia have been killed in fighting with Congo s army in the past week, local army spokesman Jules Ngongo said, a spike in violence he attributed to an army crackdown on the militia s harassment of local residents. Friday s attack, in which two rebels were also wounded, was a rare frontal assault on U.N. forces charged with protecting civilians in Congo s east, where dozens of armed groups exploit mineral resources and prey on local residents.  Very early this morning, about 30 Mai-Mai attacked,  mission spokeswoman Florence Marchal told Reuters, adding that U.N. forces drove off the assailants. It was not immediately clear which Mai-Mai group attacked nor what their objective was. The Mai-Mai comprise a number of armed bands that originally formed to resist Rwandan invasions in the 1990s. They have since morphed into a wide variety of ethnic-based militia, smuggling networks and protection rackets. Congo s mineral-rich eastern borderlands are a tinderbox of ethnic tensions and for more than two decades have been racked by violence that has often spilled across the country s borders. President Joseph Kabila s refusal to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December has fueled further unrest in the country s east, where wars between 1996-2003 killed millions, and center, where an insurgency against the central government has killed thousands since last August. Last week, U.N. forces in east Congo s South Kivu province intervened with helicopters and heavy machine guns to help beat back an advance by a separate rebel group on the strategic city of Uvira. The U.N. mission in Congo, known as MONUSCO, is the world s largest with some 18,000 uniformed personnel and a more than $1 billion annual budget.  ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday approved an agreement between the U.S. Justice Department and Ferguson, Missouri, to reform the city\u2019s police department, a pact prompted by the 2014 shooting of an unarmed black teenager that sparked violent protests. U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry of Missouri\u2019s Eastern District approved the 129-page accord, which also outlines the revamping of the St. Louis suburb\u2019s municipal law code. The Justice Department and Ferguson recognize \u201cthat the ability of a police department to protect the community it serves is only as strong as the relationship it has with that community,\u201d the consent decree signed by Perry said. The agreement requires Ferguson police officers to undergo bias-awareness training and the department must implement an accountability system. The city also agreed that police must ensure that stop, search and arrest practices do not discriminate on the basis of race or other factors protected under law. The largely black community of Ferguson erupted into violent protests in 2014 after a grand jury chose not to indict white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of unarmed 18-year-old African-American Michael Brown. The city council in Ferguson approved the agreement in March after receiving assurances from the Justice Department that it would work with Ferguson to ensure it would not cripple city finances. A number of U.S. cities have entered into police reform pacts, including Seattle, Washington and Albuquerque, New Mexico. The decree came the day that a white St. Louis police officer shot and killed a black carjacking suspect about 10 miles (16 km) southeast of Ferguson. St. Louis Metropolitan Police Chief Sam Dotson told reporters the suspect pointed a gun at officers and one opened fire. No officers were injured and there was no dash camera in the police cruiser, he said. ",

        "text": " NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly half of American adults said the Republican healthcare reform measure is \u201cnot an improvement\u201d over Obamacare, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday.  The Republican bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which is up for a vote in the House of Representatives later on Friday, is expected to cut the federal deficit while greatly increasing the number of Americans without health insurance.  Democratic leaders are unified against the bill while some conservative Republicans have criticized it for not doing enough to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, the measure familiarly known as Obamacare which was passed in 2010 and was the signature domestic achievement of former President Barack Obama.  According to the March 13-23 poll, 49 percent of American adults said the AHCA was \u201cnot an improvement\u201d over Obamacare, which helped about 20 million people get insurance coverage. Another 33 percent said the Republican bill was \u201can improvement\u201d over Obamacare, and the remaining 18 percent did not know.  The responses were largely split along party lines. Some 19 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of Republicans said the AHCA was better than Obamacare, while 73 percent of Democrats and 22 percent of Republicans said it was not an improvement.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It first asked if people were familiar with the Republican reform. Those who said they were familiar were then asked whether they thought it was an improvement.  Altogether, some 1,741 people responded to both questions. This includes 673 Republicans and 829 Democrats. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 4 percentage points for the responses from Democrats and the Republicans.  \u00a0(See a graphic of what Americans think of the GOP healthcare plan here: here)  ",

Queen Elizabeth s grandson Harry, 33, fifth-in-line to the throne, and U.S. actress Markle, 36, previously best known for her leading role in U.S. legal drama  Suits , announced their engagement on Monday, igniting a transatlantic media frenzy. In the central English city of Nottingham, the pair, both wearing long navy overcoats, greeted hundreds of smiling well-wishers, some waving British and U.S. flags.  We love Harry, and Meghan - she looks beautiful doesn t she?  Betty Parker, 78, told Reuters as she waited to meet the couple.  We re so happy for them both,  Mary Cooper, 60, said.  We always come and see him whenever he comes here and it s lovely that he keeps coming to Nottingham and has sort of adopted this city.  The couple were visiting a charity fair to mark World Aids Day, an event particularly symbolic for Harry whose late mother Princess Diana is credited with playing an important role in breaking down the stigma that was attached to the disease.    The event, held by the Terrence Higgins Trust, remembers lives lost to HIV and marks the progress made in fighting it. Harry has become a prominent campaigner on the issue, following in the footsteps of Diana who opened Britain s first HIV/AIDS unit in London in 1987 and confronted stigma by kissing an AIDS patient during a hospital visit.  They are so wonderful together, and you can clearly see that there is an immense amount of love and adoration for each other from the personal point of view of course but also for the work that each other are involved in,  said HIV campaigner Chris O Hanlon, who met the couple at the event.     Afterwards, the couple went to Nottingham Academy to meet headteachers from local schools and hear about the Full Effect programme, an initiative supported by the charity of Harry, his elder brother Prince William and William s wife Kate, which seeks to deter children from becoming involved in violence. Markle, who has been a campaigner for several causes including work as a U.N women s advocate, is to give up her previous charity roles as she begins life in Britain s royal family, Harry s spokesman said on Tuesday. She was also keen to travel around Britain to get to know the country that will become her home as she intends to become a British citizen, the spokesman added.  The couple, who became engaged earlier this month at the cottage they share in the grounds of Kensington Palace in central London, are to be married next May in St George s Chapel at Windsor Castle, the family home of British kings and queens for almost 1,000 years.  This is good. I m excited to have some Americans in the royal family,  U.S. student Mark Arnold, who is studying at Nottingham University, told Reuters.  It s really nice, I m excited.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer on Tuesday denied that he or Trump colluded with Russia to interfere in last year\u2019s presidential election, and said such charges were meant to discredit Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cI emphatically state that I had nothing to do with any Russian involvement in our electoral process,\u201d Michael Cohen said in a statement prepared for a scheduled meeting with Senate Intelligence Committee investigators that was ultimately postponed. \u201cGiven my own proximity to the president of the United States as a candidate, let me also say that I never saw anything - not a hint of anything - that demonstrated his involvement in Russian interference in our election or any form of Russia collusion,\u201d Cohen said. After the statement was reported by media organizations on Tuesday morning, Cohen and his attorney, Stephen Ryan, traveled to Capitol Hill for a closed-door interview with Intelligence Committee investigators - but were told that the committee had decided to postpone the meeting. The Senate committee, as well as other congressional panels and special counsel Robert Mueller, are investigating Russia\u2019s reported interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump or his top aides colluded with Moscow. Cohen\u2019s name surfaced in a dossier, compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, that reported Cohen played an important role in liaison with the Russian government and secretly met with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016. The Steele dossier, Cohen said in his statement, is \u201criddled with falsehoods and intentionally salacious allegations.\u201d \u201cI have never in my life been to Prague or to anywhere in the Czech Republic,\u201d he said. Current and former U.S. intelligence officials have said that while they cannot verify all the details in the Steele dossier, neither have they debunked it entirely. It was not immediately clear why Cohen\u2019s meeting with Senate investigators was postponed. \u201cThe committee has chosen to postpone today\u2019s interview and we will come back for a voluntary interview whenever we can to meet with them,\u201d Ryan told reporters. \u201cMr. Cohen will continue to co-operate.\u201d Cohen said in his statement that the collusion charges are meant to discredit Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cI\u2019m also certain that there are some in this country who do not care about the facts, but simply want to politicize this issue, choosing to presume guilt - rather than presuming innocence - so as to discredit our lawfully elected president in the public eye,\u201d he said.

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A wealthy Turkish gold trader charged in the United States with violating U.S. sanctions against Iran sought support from and invoked the name of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to advance his business, U.S. prosecutors said. The allegations against the trader, Reza Zarrab, had been detailed in a Monday federal court filing in Manhattan, but the Turkish lira fell more than 1 percent against the U.S. dollar after Bloomberg News reported the filing on Friday. Erdogan has not been accused of wrongdoing, but the case has complicated the U.S. relationship with Turkey, a crucial Middle East ally.  Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Zarrab, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Turkish government officials could not immediately be reached. Prosecutors accused the Iranian-born Zarrab and co-conspirators of handling hundreds of millions of dollars for Iran s government and Iranian entities from 2010 to 2015, in a scheme to evade U.S. actions. Nine people have been criminally charged, but only Zarrab and a banker from Turkey s Halkbank, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, are in U.S. custody. A trial is scheduled for Nov. 27. But in a filing late Friday, Atilla s lawyers requested a delay to January 2018, citing the amount of work still be done,  much of it  in Turkey, and the difficulty of trial preparation with Atilla housed in a Manhattan jail.  In Monday s filing, prosecutors said  the government anticipates that the evidence introduced at trial will show that Turkish government and banking officials were integral to the sanctions evasion scheme.  The filing detailed recorded phone conversations and documents that according to prosecutors suggest Zarrab was looking out for Erdogan s interests. It said one call occurred on April 16, 2013, when Zarrab spoke with another defendant about his efforts to buy a bank to establish a conduit for Iranian transactions. Prosecutors said Zarrab and Erdogan, then Turkey s prime minister, had spoken four days earlier at a wedding.  I explained it that day at the wedding,  Zarrab told the co-defendant, according to prosecutors.  I will go back and will say, Mr. Prime Minister, if you approve, give me a license, I will go though BDDK (the Turkish bank regulator) even if I bought the bank anyway.  In a separate filing, Atilla s lawyers have said Zarrab has  essentially not participated  in the case and that Atilla might be the only defendant appearing at trial. This raised speculation that Zarrab might be preparing a guilty plea or to cooperate, or that charges against him may change. The case is U.S. v.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s first budget proposal will spare big social welfare programs such as Social Security and Medicare from any cuts, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview broadcast on Sunday. Mnuchin said Trump would also use a major policy speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night to preview some elements of his sweeping plans to cut taxes for the middle class, simplify the tax system and make American companies more globally competitive with lower rates and changes to encourage U.S. manufacturing. Speaking on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d program, Mnuchin, who has acknowledged that tax reform is his top policy priority, said the budget plan would not seek cuts to federal benefits programs known as \u201centitlements.\u201d \u201cWe are not touching those now. So don\u2019t expect to see that as part of this budget, OK,\u201d Mnuchin said of the programs, according to a transcript provided by Fox. \u201cWe are very focused on other aspects and that\u2019s what\u2019s very important to us.\u00a0And that\u2019s the president\u2019s priority.\u201d Trump during his election campaign promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare healthcare for seniors nor Medicaid healthcare for the poor. Preservation of these programs, coupled with a middle-class tax cut, would aid the retirees and working class Americans who make up a significant portion of Trump\u2019s political base. In a transcript of the Fox News Channel interview, Mnuchin said Trump will be \u201ctouching on tax reform\u201d in his speech. Mnuchin said the plan would cut the number of tax brackets and \u201ccreate a level playing field for U.S. companies to be able to compete in the world.\u201d But Wall Street, which has sent stocks to record highs on anticipation of Trump\u2019s tax cut plans, has grown impatient and could react negatively to a lack of substantive details about the plan in Trump\u2019s speech, financial analysts said.    With both chambers of the U.S. Congress in Republican hands, Trump has the potential to enact major elements of his legislative agenda.  But divisions with the Republican Party over the approach on Obamacare and taxes could prove to be an obstacle. Some Republican lawmakers have urged Trump to lay out more specifics on his policy plans, saying that more White House engagement is needed to build momentum in Congress for his agenda. Mnuchin offered little new information and said key tax plan  elements were not yet settled. He said Trump was looking at a \u201creciprocal tax\u201d that would help create more trade parity with other countries. Trump administration officials have complained that many countries charge value-added taxes on imports while exempting exports from taxation. But Mnuchin again said he was still \u201cstudying very carefully\u201d a House Republican border tax adjustment plan that would levy a 20 percent tax on imports to encourage more U.S.-based production and exports. That plan aims to raise more than $1 trillion in revenue over a decade to offset lower tax rates for businesses. \u201cThere are certain aspects that the president likes about the concept of a border-adjusted tax, there are certain aspects that he\u2019s very concerned about,\u201d Mnuchin said.  He added that the Trump administration would work with the House of Representatives and Senate to craft \u201ca combined plan that takes the best of all of this when we bring it forward.\u201d In a comment suggesting that Trump\u2019s budget and tax plans may use aggressive revenue assumptions, Mnuchin said the administration \u201cfundamentally believes in dynamic scoring,\u201d a budget calculation method that assumes that a lower tax burden boosts revenues by encouraging economic activity.

        "text": "CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The city of Cleveland and the American Civil Liberties Union on Friday settled a federal lawsuit over free speech limits outside the Republican National Convention next month, setting the stage for lively demonstrations during Donald Trump\u2019s big moment. The city had been seeking a restricted zone of 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) around the Quicken Loans Arena, site of the convention, where free speech and mobility would be limited. That prompted an ACLU lawsuit on behalf of three protest groups that argued the so-called event zone was too large and the security regulations too strict. Details of the new event zone and protest rules were not immediately available. \u201cToday, counsel advised me that the case is settled and that they will execute a settlement agreement expeditiously,\u201d U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster said in a statement. Another judge on Thursday had struck down Cleveland\u2019s plan for placing limits on protests, issuing a preliminary injunction in favor of the ACLU and referring the case to Polster for mediation. Trump is expected to become the Republican Party\u2019s official nominee for president at the July 18-21 convention, which will attract protesters for various causes who plan to demonstrate outside. Trump campaign events have drawn large and raucous demonstrations with some resulting in clashes between the candidate\u2019s supporters and opponents. The plaintiffs in the Cleveland lawsuit are Citizens for Trump, a Texas-based group that supports the wealthy businessman\u2019s campaign; Organize Ohio, a liberal activist group; and Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, a charitable organization. Citizens for Trump anticipates 104 cars and trucks, 100 motorcycles, four horses and at least 5,000 people to participate in its event, while Organize Ohio expects 3,000 to 5,000 marchers, the ACLU said.

        "text": "EDMONTON, Alberta (Reuters) - The Somali immigrant charged with attempted murder in connection with a weekend vehicle and knife attack in Edmonton, Alberta, was detained in the United States pending deportation before claiming refugee status in Canada, U.S. officials said on Tuesday. Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, 30, is accused of running down a police officer with his car on Saturday night and then stabbing him repeatedly. Police said he fled before driving a U-Haul truck into four pedestrians during an attempt to evade capture. Sharif was in custody in the United States for about four months in the summer and autumn of 2011, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokeswoman Lauren Mack said in a statement.  He was ordered deported to Somalia but released on an  order of supervision  on Nov. 23, 2011. Sharif did not appear for a scheduled meeting in January 2012, and efforts to locate him  were not successful,  the statement said. Sharif  had no known criminal history at the time of his encounters with ICE,  the ICE statement added. Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Sharif made a refugee claim at a Canadian border crossing in 2012 and obtained refugee status later that year. In 2015, a complaint led police to probe Sharif s alleged extremist ideology, but officers found no grounds for criminal charges after what the Royal Canadian Mounted Police described as an  exhaustive investigation.  Goodale said on Monday it would be wrong to blame the attack on any shortcomings in Canada s immigration and refugee vetting system. Sharif, who faces 11 charges including five counts of attempted murder, appeared via video in an Edmonton court on Tuesday wearing an orange jail uniform. He had a Somali interpreter, although he did not speak. He occasionally looked down or clasped his hands in front of him and still bore facial bruises that police say he sustained while evading capture.  A community leader, Mahamad Accord, who did not speak to Sharif but learned about him from the local Somali community, said Sharif was from a Somali ethnic minority and little known in the community. Edmonton police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Sharif s lawyer, Chady Moustarah, said he had stepped in on short notice to help someone without representation but that the accused would have to find another lawyer going forward. Sharif remains in custody until his  next court appearance, scheduled for Nov. 14. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller pushed back on Sunday against Paul Manafort\u2019s efforts to avoid house arrest, arguing that President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager needed to further detail the finances behind his proposed $12 million bail agreement. In a court memorandum, Mueller and his attorneys argued that the court should only agree to a bail agreement if Manafort fully explains his finances to the court. Prosecutors said his team had not been able to substantiate the value of one of the three properties, as well as several life insurance policies, Manafort wants to pledge for bail. Manafort, who ran Trump\u2019s presidential campaign for several months last year, and associate Richard Gates pleaded not guilty last week to a 12-count indictment by a federal grand jury. They face charges including conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine\u2019s former pro-Russian government. The two are currently under house arrest, and prosecutors have argued they could pose a flight risk. The charges are part of Mueller\u2019s investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 election in Trump\u2019s favor and potential collusion by Trump associates, allegations that Moscow and the Republican president deny. In a Saturday court filing, Manafort offered to limit his travel and pledged life insurance worth about $4.5 million as well as about $8 million in real estate assets, including a property on Fifth Avenue in New York that was identified by some media outlets as an apartment in Trump Tower. But prosecutors said they needed an independent appraisal of that Fifth Avenue property, since Manafort was claiming a fair-market value of the unit that appeared to exceed other outside estimates. Prosecutors also argued they needed time to talk to Manafort\u2019s insurance company about his policies. The prosecutors noted that Manafort would be required to forfeit one of those policies, worth $2.6 million, should he be convicted, creating additional questions about its value in a potential bail agreement. In the document, Mueller said his team was in talks with Manafort\u2019s counsel about striking a bail agreement but that Manafort had not provided enough detail yet on his finances. \u201cThose discussions are best described as ongoing, and the government is not prepared to consent to a change in the current conditions of release at least until Manafort provides a full accounting of his net worth and the value of the assets that he proposes to pledge,\u201d Mueller said in the court memorandum. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said on Thursday that initial bail terms would remain in place and set a bail hearing for Monday to consider changes. ",

        "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court on Thursday acquitted a former telecoms minister, politicians and business executives of graft and money laundering charges in the grant of telecoms licenses due to lack of evidence in one of the country s biggest corruption scandals. The case relates to alleged below-market-price sale of lucrative telecoms permits bundled with airwaves in 2008, which a federal auditor said may have cost the government as much as $28 billion in lost revenue. A special court convened by the federal investigator was called to give its verdict on the accused, including former telecoms minister A. Raja.  The prosecution has miserably failed to prove its charge,  defense lawyer Vijay Aggarwal told reporters, citing the judge s ruling. Shares of companies affected by the case rose after the verdict, with Reliance Communications Ltd gaining as much as 13.3 percent, DB Realty jumping nearly 20 percent and SUN TV Networks Ltd rising as much as 6.8 percent. The scandal dented the fortunes of then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his government, which oversaw the sale of the licenses at below-market prices, and triggered street protests. It was one of the several scandals that emerged during Singh s second term, hobbling policymaking and diverting the government s attention away from pushing forward crucial economic reforms. The uncertainty hurt business sentiment in Asia s third-biggest economy, and led to questions about the government s efforts to crack down on corruption. In 2012, the Supreme Court ordered 122 licenses held by eight operators to be revoked, declaring the licenses illegal and the process  wholly arbitrary, capricious and contrary to public interest .

        "title": "Brutal Myanmar army operation aimed at preventing Rohingya return: U.N",
        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - Myanmar security forces have brutally driven out half a million Muslim Rohingya from northern Rakhine state, torching their homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning, the U.N. human rights office said on Wednesday. Jyoti Sanghera, head of the Asia and Pacific region of the U.N. human rights office, called on Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi to  stop the violence  and voiced fear that if the stateless Rohingya refugees return from Bangladesh they may be interned.  If villages have been completely destroyed and livelihood possibilities have been destroyed, what we fear is that they may be incarcerated or detained in camps,  she told a news briefing. U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman is due to visit Myanmar on Friday, said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric.  In a report based on 65 interviews with Rohingya who have arrived in Bangladesh in the past month, the U.N. human rights office said that  clearance operations  had begun before insurgent attacks on police posts on Aug. 25 and included killings, torture and rape of children. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein - who has described the government operations as  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing  - said in a statement that the actions appeared to be  a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return .  Credible information indicates that the Myanmar security forces purposely destroyed the property of the Rohingyas, scorched their dwellings and entire villages in northern Rakhine State, not only to drive the population out in droves but also to prevent the fleeing Rohingya victims from returning to their homes,  the report said. It said the destruction by security forces, often joined by mobs of armed Rakhine Buddhists, of houses, fields, food stocks, crops, and livestock made the possibility of Rohingya returning to normal lives in northern Rakhine  almost impossible . The campaign was  well-organized, coordinated and systematic  and began with Rohingya men under 40 being arrested a month earlier, creating a  climate of fear and intimidation .  We are not in a position to make a finding of genocide or not, but this should in no way detract from the seriousness of the situation which the Rohingya population is currently facing,  said Thomas Hunecke, who led the team that went to Cox s Bazar, Bangladesh, from Sept. 14-24. It was  highly likely  that Myanmar security forces planted landmines along the border in recent weeks to prevent Rohingya from returning, he said, citing doctors treating injuries. Despite growing international condemnation of the crisis, the military campaign is popular in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and for Muslims in general, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged. Myanmar on Tuesday launched its first bid to improve relations between Buddhists and Muslims since the eruption of deadly violence inflamed the communal tension and triggered an exodus of some 520,000 Muslims to Bangladesh. But the U.N. s Sanghera, noting that 11,000 Rohingya crossed into Bangladesh on Monday alone, said:  Clearly it seems that some level of eviction, displacement, forced movement and violence may be continuing.  The U.N. experts documented Myanmar security forces  firing indiscriminately at Rohingya villagers, injuring and killing other innocent victims, setting houses on fire .  Almost all testimonies indicated that people were shot at close range and in the back while they tried to flee in panic,  the report said.  The U.N. report quoted a 12-year-old girl from Rathedaung township as saying the security forces had surrounded her house and started shooting.  It was a situation of panic   they shot my sister in front of me. She was only seven years old. She cried and told me to run. I tried to protect her and care for her, but we had no medical assistance on the hillside and she was bleeding so much that after one day she died. I buried her myself.  The girl did not know what happened to her mother and four brothers, nor her father jailed a month earlier.  The United Nations said on Wednesday that its current top official in Myanmar, Renata Lok-Dessallien, would finish her nearly four-year assignment at the end of October. Myanmar is stalling on accepting a plan by the U.N. to upgrade the U.N. country head to the more powerful rank of assistant secretary-general (ASG) when Lok-Dessallien leaves. Thaung Tun, Suu Kyi s national security adviser, told Reuters earlier this month that the U.N.  must treat us equally,  adding that:  We ll be fine with anybody if all member states have an ASG assigned. Not just us.  ",

        "title": "Thai junta leader, backers fuel suspicions of plans to stay in power",
        "text": "BANGKOK (Reuters) - In his dark suit, Thai junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha cut an incongruous figure guiding a rice tractor across a muddy paddy field in front of cameras and watching villagers. The prime minister s latest photo opportunity won applause from farmers watching in straw hats and his visit to Suphan Buri on Monday brought a call from a local political bigwig for him to stay in power for another decade. Political activities in Thailand have been suspended since Prayuth s 2014 coup, but Thai politicians are asking whether what looks like campaigning is exactly what it seems. The trips to the countryside, a new Facebook account and a chorus of political groups offering support are raising suspicions of a plan to keep Prayuth in power even if long-promised elections happen next year.  It s not beyond expectations that he is out campaigning in the provinces to prepare to become prime minister again,  said Chaturon Chaisang, a leader of the Pheu Thai party, which under various names has won every election for a generation. Since August, Prayuth has visited six provinces, including places traditionally considered important battlegrounds for elections. Such trips with his cabinet will now be monthly. In the previous three years, he had only taken two such trips outside Bangkok.  I am not here to make people love me, but I want everyone to love the country,  Prayuth, 63, told farmers in Suphan Buri, 100 km (60 miles) north of Bangkok.  Said 60-year-old farmer Samruay Tongpratet:  If the prime minister can truly help the poor then he can stay as long as he wants.   Prayuth s office declined to comment on any plan to keep him in power.  Politics will not resume until well after the cremation next month of the revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died last October, and the subsequent coronation of his son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn.  In the meantime, Prayuth has the field to himself.   That s why he needed to hold these mobile cabinet meetings in the provinces, act more like a politician, hold rallies, and meet the people,  said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University, noting the signs that Prayuth wants to stay longer.  Last month, Prayuth set up a Facebook page with pictures of him walking with his arm around a farmer s shoulder and giving alms to monks. It now has nearly 11,000 likes. A poll in June showed that 53 percent of Thais would like Prayuth to serve another term. Although Thailand s economic growth lags other countries in Southeast Asia and dissent is strongly repressed, surveys show that Prayuth s backers welcome the stability since the coup. Whether that calm survives electioneering is another question after over a decade of turmoil between colour-coded factions that Prayuth said he sought to end with his coup. On one side is the  yellow  Democrat Party, which is popular with middle-class voters and has strong support in Bangkok and parts of the south. On the other side is the  red  movement of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose parties appeal to poorer voters, particularly in the populous northeast. Thaksin s sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, was overthrown by Prayuth in the 2014 coup and last month fled Thailand ahead of a verdict in a corruption trial - eliminating a charismatic party figurehead who might also have rallied opposition to Prayuth. Although he cannot technically stand for election because he would have needed to resign by July, a new constitution drawn up at the junta s behest does offer him a route.  He could be chosen as an  outside prime minister  - foreseen under the constitution if the winning party fails to get enough votes for its candidate in the 500-member lower house of parliament. In such a case, the upper house would also have a say - its 250 members will be picked by the military. Prayuth would still need support from at least half the lower house, however. Although neither of Thailand s two main political parties has said it would endorse him, smaller players are mobilizing. Paiboon Nititawan, a former member of a now-defunct reform council, has set up an office for a new People s Reform Party to back Prayuth.  Suchart Chantharachotikul, a classmate of Prayuth from military school, told Reuters he is coordinating smaller parties to form a grouping to back the junta leader.   Prayuth s military government isn t perfect, but they took care of problems like unrest. It wouldn t be so strange if he stays on for another four years,  Suchart said. A composer of sentimental ballads, Prayuth has dropped hints in his music of a longer term political future. His latest song,  Bridge , repeats a message that he will stay as long as it takes to steer Thailand through troubled waters.  My two hands won t let you go,  says one refrain. ",

Girling, who like Ashworth and Fox opposed Brexit during last year s referendum, defended her decision to vote with the overwhelming majority in Strasbourg on Tuesday on a non-binding resolution which urged EU leaders not to accept London s request for talks on post-Brexit trade without further concessions.  I did not vote to prevent trade talks,  she said, noting she called for such negotiations. However, she said in a statement that it was  patently obvious  that the EU s test of  sufficient progress  on key divorce issues were not yet met.  Her vote, she said, put the interests of her constituents over party discipline and referred to support on the far-right for Britain to walk out without a deal:  I have never agreed to silently acquiesce as our country heads towards a cliff edge,  she said, describing that as  wanton economic self-harm .  May, who also opposed Brexit, is battling to contain in-fighting over approaches to Brexit and threats to her leadership after an uncertain party conference performance last week. Her Brexit minister David Davis is due back in Brussels this week for further talks. The party statement said Davis had written to leaders of the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties to complain after most British MEPs voted with the majority. He urged Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to suspend most of his MEPs. ",

        "text": "ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The United States is considering how to pressure South Sudan s President Salva Kiir into peace, but withdrawing aid may not work, U.S. envoy to the United Nations Nikki Haley said ahead of a visit to South Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia on Tuesday.  Haley plans to visit Gambella in western Ethiopia, where nearly 350,000 refugees have flooded across the border from South Sudan since the country spiraled into civil war in 2013, just two years after it gained independence from Sudan.   You have to really think hard before you pull U.S. aid because President Kiir doesn t care,  Haley said.  He doesn t care if his people suffer and that s the concern we have as we don t know that will make a difference.   That s a conversation we will have and we will try and see exactly what will move President Kiir so that he does ... start to really look at creating a safe position for his people,  she told reporters in Addis Ababa late on Monday. Haley will this week be the most senior member of U.S. President Donald Trump s administration to visit South Sudan, where she is due to meet with Kiir. But first, she will see how the conflict has threatened to spillover through deadly cross-border raids into Gambella, Ethiopia by gunmen from South Sudan.  Trump s new aid administrator, Mark Green, visited South Sudan last month, telling Kiir that Washington was reviewing its policy toward his government. He called on Kiir to end the violence and implement a  real  ceasefire.  The war in South Sudan was sparked by a feud between Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar. It has plunged parts of the world s youngest nation into famine and forced a third of the population - some 4 million people - to flee their homes. Machar fled and is now being held in South Africa to stop him stirring up trouble, sources told Reuters in December.  A fragile peace deal broke down last year amid gun battles between soldiers and rebels in the capital Juba. International efforts to bring warring sides to new talks have not succeeded.  We can t see any more deaths, we can t see anymore famine, we ve got to start seeing the situation start to get better and I think that the pressure is only going to continue until President Kiir makes a difference,  Haley said.  The Trump administration last month imposed sanctions on two senior South Sudanese officials and the former army chief for their role in the conflict, atrocities against civilians and attacks against international missions in South Sudan.

        "text": "(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration on Wednesday: A crisis over the relationship between Trump\u2019s aides and Russia deepens as a growing number of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans demand expanded congressional inquiries into the matter. The Trump administration offers the job of national security adviser to U.S. Vice Admiral Robert Harward, sources say, but it is not clear if he accepted. The Kremlin says U.S. media reports about Russian intelligence connections to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign are groundless. Russia also says it will not return Crimea to Ukraine or discuss the matter with foreign partners after the White House says Trump expects the annexed Black Sea peninsula to be  returned. Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, withdraws his name from consideration amid concerns that he could not garner enough Senate votes to be confirmed.     Trump\u2019s choice of Representative Mick Mulvaney to become White House budget director on Wednesday appears to pick up enough Republican votes to vault him into the job. Trump drops U.S. insistence on a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a long-standing bedrock of Middle East policy, even as he urges Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to curb settlement construction. Trump says tax code revisions are a critical way to boost the nation\u2019s economy as he kicks off a White House meeting with chief executive officers of Target Corp, Best Buy Co Inc and six other major retailers. Trump\u2019s defense secretary seeks to reassure NATO of steadfast U.S. support at talks in Brussels as nervous European allies try to look past the president\u2019s rhetoric and the turmoil within his administration. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is heading to Bonn to interact with counterparts from the Group of 20 top economies at a time many are wondering how strongly Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d message will reshape U.S. foreign policy. Vice President Mike Pence also is bound for Europe this week to meet with allies seeking clarity on the administration\u2019s foreign policy strategy and its stance toward Russia. Staff at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have been told that Trump is preparing a handful of executive orders to reshape the agency, to be signed once a new administrator is confirmed, two sources say. The Trump administration proposes changes to the Obamacare individual insurance market that insurers welcome as a good start but that others say could raise consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket cost. ",

        "title": "Exclusive: Atlantic City emergency fiscal management costs top $2.6 million",
        "text": "(Reuters) - New Jersey taxpayers will owe $2.62 million for roughly a year\u2019s worth of work by a team of professionals called in to help turn around the distressed gambling hub Atlantic City, according to invoices obtained and compiled by Reuters. It is not clear what taxpayers have to show for it. Despite the work by a state-appointed emergency manager and the law and accounting firms he hired, so little progress has been made in reversing the seaside resort\u2019s fortunes that lawmakers are now considering a full takeover of city operations. Reuters reported in September that the amount was $2.15 million, but invoice reports since then for additional work by restructuring lawyers at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom have pushed the total up by 20 percent. Reuters obtained the documents through a public records request. Governor Chris Christie appointed Kevin Lavin as emergency manager on Jan. 22, 2015. Since then, Lavin\u2019s team has produced one report, in March.  The Press of Atlantic City this month obtained a non-public  draft of a follow-up report. A spokesman for Lavin told Reuters last week that a report is expected \u201cwithin the coming weeks.\u201d Four of the city\u2019s eight casinos closed in 2014, pummeled by  competition from neighboring states. That contributed to a 70 percent reduction in the city\u2019s property tax base, to a projected $6 billion this year from $20.5 billion in 2010.  Lavin and his team - including Skadden, Ernst & Young LLP [ERNY.UL], and mediator Donald Steckroth - were to review and propose solutions to the city\u2019s immediate fiscal crisis, suggest possible longer-term fixes and negotiate with labor unions. Separately, the state had already appointed a monitor and had to approve the city\u2019s budget and hiring. But lawmakers are seeking an even firmer grasp. On Tuesday, they introduced legislation that would strip Atlantic City\u2019s elected officials of most of their control, except for the ability to file for municipal bankruptcy. \u201cYou can\u2019t justify a $262 million budget for 40,000 people. It\u2019s obscene,\u201d Senate President Steve Sweeney, a co-sponsor of the bill, said earlier this week. \u201c(The mayor and city council) need to make the tough decisions now.\u201d Mayor Don Guardian and city council members denounced the takeover proposal. Guardian said on Wednesday the city trimmed $14 million from its 2015 budget and expects to cut $16 million more this year. ",

        "text": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional panel has warned of an \u201calarming\u201d rise in China\u2019s interference in Hong Kong, noting fears over the former British colony\u2019s continued role as a global financial hub. In its annual report to Congress on Wednesday, the bipartisan U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission highlights the \u201cchilling\u201d abduction and detention of five booksellers based in Hong Kong as well as pressure on media and academic freedoms. Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement that ensures its freedoms, independent legal system and wide-ranging autonomy remain intact. The commission, in a detailed 33-page section, urges a fresh probe from the State Department into Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and freedoms, as well as continued congressional oversight. \u201cHong Kong\u2019s traditional standing as a global financial hub has significant economic implications for the United States, as U.S. trade and investment ties with Hong Kong are substantial,\u201d the report notes. It says the booksellers\u2019 detentions - including two foreign nationals and one who was abducted inside Hong Kong - broadened domestic fears of mainland encroachment and sparked a record turnout in September\u2019s legislative election. \u201cThis incident has threatened the maintenance of the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 framework and led some observers to question Hong Kong\u2019s status as a leading global financial hub,\u201d the report warns. \u201cThe election took place against the backdrop of an alarming rise in mainland interference in Hong Kong.\u201d U.S. senators Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton also introduced a bill that would freeze U.S.-based assets and ban U.S. entry of those responsible for the \u201csurveillance, abduction, detention, or forced confessions of certain booksellers and journalists in Hong Kong\u201d, according to a statement on Rubio\u2019s senate website. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Hong Kong was an internal matter for China and no foreign country had the right to interfere. \u201cIn order to try to split the country, some forces have openly sought foreign support,\u201d Geng told a daily news briefing. \u201cThose who attempt to use foreign forces to achieve their own political goals will not succeed.\u201d The report comes amid deepening concerns in Beijing over a fledgling independence movement in the city. The High Court this week backed a government demand to bar two recently elected lawmakers, who insulted China when taking their oath of office, from the legislature. In a statement after the report\u2019s release, the Hong Kong government said the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle was being implemented successfully, as was the city\u2019s role as a global commercial hub. It also urged foreign parties not to interfere. The booksellers were involved in the production and sale of gossipy political titles banned in mainland China but freely available in Hong Kong. Their plight fueled Western governments\u2019 concerns and sparked formal diplomatic protests. One of the five men, Swedish passport holder Gui Minhai, who disappeared from the Thai resort of Pattaya last October, is the only one still in detention in China. Another, Lam Wing-kee, returned to Hong Kong in June, saying he had been held captive by Chinese agents for eight months.  The report places the worsening climate in the city in the context of China\u2019s broader disregard for international legal agreements and norms on issues such as the South China Sea and Taiwan. ",

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a deputy White House press secretary, said congressional investigations into possible Russian hacking of Democratic groups would have to run their course before Sessions needed to decide whether to step aside from the FBI probes. Sessions was a top adviser to President Donald Trump, a Republican, during the 2016 presidential campaign.  \u201cI wasn\u2019t saying that he shouldn\u2019t recuse himself or that he should,\u201d Sanders told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cMy point is I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.

President Barack Obama, a Democrat, expelled Russian diplomats in retaliation in December.  Moscow has denied the accusations. The FBI is investigating alleged Russian election-related hacking and financial transactions by Russian people and companies believed to have links to associates of Trump, according to current and former government officials. Trump has dismissed the controversy about ties between his aides and Russia as a \u201cruse\u201d perpetrated by a hostile news media. \u201cRussia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday.

        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump was poised on Tuesday to nominate Washington lawyer Marvin Kaplan to the National Labor Relations Board, nudging the agency toward a Republican majority that could overturn a series of decisions that have riled businesses. Late on Monday, the White House issued a statement saying Trump had selected Kaplan, a fellow Republican currently with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, to one of the board\u2019s five seats. After Trump officially names him, he must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  The NLRB, which oversees union elections and disputes between workers, unions, and employers, has been controlled by Democrats for nearly a decade, and they currently have a 2-1 majority with two vacancies. The board, when fully stocked, includes three members from the president\u2019s party and two from the opposing party. Under Trump, lawyers and business groups expect the board to roll back a series of policy changes adopted during the administration of former President Barack Obama.  Chief among those was a 2015 decision that expanded the circumstances in which a company is considered a \u201cjoint employer\u201d liable for legal violations by contractors, staffing agencies, and franchisees.  The NLRB is also expected to revisit new rules designed to speed up the union election process that business groups say favor unions, and decisions allowing workers to use company email accounts to organize and to picket on employers\u2019 private property. Kaplan, who did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, previously worked for Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives crafting employment-related legislation, including a bill that would undo the new union election rules.

(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told residents of Flint, Michigan, on Thursday their \u201chorrific\u201d water contamination crisis should be a wake-up call about the country\u2019s crumbling infrastructure and required an emergency response. \u201cIf there is any silver lining out of this tragedy, it is my hope that the American people will look at Flint and say, \u2018never again,\u2019\u201d Sanders said on his first campaign visit to the city, where a cost-saving decision to switch the water supply has led to a public health crisis from lead contamination. \u201cWe are looking at children being poisoned - if that is not an emergency, I just don\u2019t know what an emergency is,\u201d Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, told about 300 people jammed into a Flint church for a meeting that at times featured a freewheeling exchange with shouting residents. Sanders, who has made his call for a $1 trillion investment in U.S. infrastructure a key part of his campaign agenda, said Flint\u2019s water crisis illustrated the need for a long-term commitment to rebuilding dilapidated water systems across the country. \u201cWhile Flint may be the canary in the coal mine, there are a lot of other canaries all around the country. The truth is our infrastructure is collapsing,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI hope that out of the tragedy will come fundamental changes.\u201d Sanders\u2019 Democratic campaign rival, Hillary Clinton, visited the predominantly black city weeks ago and frequently highlights the crisis as an example of racial inequity as the two candidates vie for African-American support. Sanders has called for the resignation of Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, and met recently with some Flint activists during a visit to Michigan. He told the Flint crowd that hearing their stories of suffering was \u201chorrific.\u201d \u201cClearly this is part of a long-term trend of starving communities of color,\u201d he said. The crisis was triggered when a city manager installed by Snyder switched the city\u2019s water supply from Lake Michigan to the nearby Flint River. The change corroded Flint\u2019s aging pipes and released lead and other toxins into the water supply. President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency in Flint in January, authorizing federal emergency management officials to coordinate relief efforts. Lawmakers in Congress have wrestled with the size of a federal funding package to replace aging pipes. Sanders and Clinton will return to Flint on March 6 for their next nationally televised debate ahead of the Michigan primary on March 8.

        "text": "BUKAVU, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Naval boats fended off attacks by rebels on Lake Tanganyika in the east of Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday as heavy fighting spread close to the lakeside city of Uvira, sources in the area said.     Fighting between the Mai-Mai Yakutumba militia and Congo government forces broke out at the weekend on the outskirts of Uvira, close to the Burundi border. Unrest has mounted across Congo since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down when his mandate expired last December.   Since 5 a.m. (0300 GMT) there has been an exchange of gunfire between the army and the Mai-Mai in Uvira,  said Lubungula Dem s M Sato, a member of a peacebuilding advocacy group in Uvira, the second largest city in South Kivu province.  Congo s navy also repelled an attack by five rebel boats on the lake, military spokesman Louis-Claude Tshimwanga said, adding that the navy had sunk one of them and that government forces remained in control of Uvira.  Lake Tanganyika is hundreds of kilometers (miles) long and also borders Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia. Mai-Mai Yakutumba, formed in 2007 by local militiamen opposed to integration in Congo s national army, has well-established gold smuggling networks on the lake. In an audio statement this week that was shared on social media, its leader William Yakutumba said his forces were rebelling against Kabila s mismanagement of the country s natural resources and failure to quit power last year. Militiamen believed to be aligned with Yakutumba in a coalition opposed to the Kinshasa government also clashed on Thursday with army troops in Kasongo in neighboring Maniema province, said Modeste Shabani, the director of a local radio station.  Meanwhile, the Congolese army s chief of staff, Didier Etumba, arrived in South Kivu s capital of Bukavu in the afternoon en route for Uvira, a Reuters witness said. Congo s mineral-rich eastern borderlands are a tinderbox of ethnic tensions and for more than two decades have been racked by violence that has often spilled across the country s borders. The region is the world s biggest source of coltan, used in mobile phones and other electronic products. Operations at Banro Corp s Namoya gold mine near the border between Maniema and South Kivu remained suspended for a fourth day on Thursday due to nearby militia activity, Banro vice president Desire Sangare told Reuters. The company s mines in the two provinces have been hit by a series of attacks and kidnappings in recent months. Congo s U.N. peacekeeping mission, MONUSCO, said it had deployed troops around Uvira to protect civilians although the recent elimination of a 100-person riverine unit as part of sweeping budget cuts across U.N. missions limited its options.   I urge the armed groups to immediately cease this hostility including all forms of violence against constituted authority and innocent civilians,  MONUSCO head Maman Sidikou said in a statement.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Monday to confirm Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, one of the U.S. politicians most closely acquainted with China, as President Donald Trump\u2019s ambassador to Beijing. One of Branstad\u2019s first challenges will be pushing China to take a harder line against North Korea, which said Monday it successfully tested what it called an intermediate-range ballistic missile, although U.S. officials and experts questioned the extent of the country\u2019s progress. Branstad assured lawmakers during his confirmation hearing he would take a firm line with the Chinese government on issues from North Korea to trade disputes and human rights, despite years working closely with Chinese officials. Branstad said his long ties would help him push Beijing on difficult topics, including North Korea and thorny trade issues. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called Branstad, 70, an \u201cold friend\u201d after decades of dealings on agricultural trade during his long career in politics in Iowa, an important farming state. The vote was 82-13, with all 13 of the votes against the Republican president\u2019s nominee coming from Democrats. Speaking in  Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Branstad had worked hard to push relations between Chinese and U.S. regions and China hoped he could play an even more positive role in increasing understanding and promoting relations once he takes office. The United States has been trying to persuade China to agree to new sanctions on North Korea, which has conducted dozens of missile firings and tested two nuclear bombs since the beginning of 2016. Trump has warned that a \u201cmajor, major conflict\u201d with North Korea is possible over its weapons programs, although U.S. officials say tougher sanctions, not military force, are the preferred option. Branstad\u2019s move to Beijing will end his 22-year-long tenure as Iowa\u2019s governor. The longest serving state governor in U.S. history, Branstad is currently serving his sixth nonconsecutive four-year term. He is due to be replaced in Des Moines by Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds, who would be the state\u2019s first woman governor. ",

        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The collapse of German Chancellor Angela Merkel s talks to form a three-way coalition government is  bad news for Europe  given the leading role of the European Union s biggest member state, the Dutch foreign minister said on Monday.  Germany s political crisis was weighing on the euro and European shares after the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) unexpectedly pulled out on Sunday from weeks of talks with Merkel s conservatives and the ecologist Greens.  It s bad news for Europe that the government in Germany will take a little longer,  new Dutch Foreign Minister Halbe Zijlstra said on arrival for talks with EU peers in Brussels.  Germany is a very influential country within the EU so if they don t have a government and therefore don t have a mandate it ll be very hard for them to take positions.  Germany s outgoing EU Minister Michael Roth, a member of the Social Democrats who are not in talks on forming a new Merkel government, said:  We all have an interest in getting a mandate so that we are able to take care fully of business in Europe.   We have never had such a situation in Germany. So, given the collapse of these exploratory talks, we will need to assess the situation and decide accordingly.  The spokesman for the EU s executive arm in Brussels stressed the need for stability in Germany, as did an official in French President Emmanuel Macron s office.  We are confident that the German constitutional process will provide the basis for the stability and continuity that has been a trademark of German politics and we hope this time will not be different,  said the European Commission s Margaritis Schinas. While some in Germany spoke of a possible new election, Zijlstra said that was a bad idea and noted that the Dutch government took seven months to form, which meant German parties could still return to talks after a pause. Foreign Minister Didier Reynders of Belgium, which was without a government for 18 months after an election, sought to strike a lighter tone on Germany.  In Belgium we have a tradition to do that, sometimes it s very long,  Reynders told reporters. Zijlstra did not think the situation in Germany affected the Brexit talks specifically for now, as the EU was  waiting for a substantial offer from the British  on the exit bill. Both Roth and Reynders agreed London must make a move on the money now. Arriving at the same talks, the Czech Republic s EU minister, Ales Chmelar, said:  We are hopeful that we will have a strong government in Germany sooner rather than later.  ",

        "title": "Democrats skip Trump meeting, raising risk of government shutdown",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic leaders in Congress skipped a meeting with President Donald Trump on Tuesday that was to have focused on the budget, raising the risk of a government shutdown next month with both sides far apart on the terms of an agreement. After Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi informed Trump they would not attend the meeting at the White House, the president and Republican congressional leaders went ahead with the talks without them. Trump left empty seats on either side of him, with name cards for Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, and Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives. He also criticized them as the cameras rolled during a picture-taking session. \u201cWe have a lot of differences,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo they\u2019ve decided not to show up. They\u2019ve been all talk and they\u2019ve been no action and now it\u2019s even worse. Now it\u2019s not even talk.\u201d Schumer and Pelosi said they pulled out of the meeting because of a tweet Trump sent earlier in the day attacking them as weak on illegal immigration and bent on raising taxes. \u201cI don\u2019t see a deal!\u201d the Republican president wrote on Twitter. Pelosi tweeted after Trump\u2019s White House session that \u201chis empty chair photo opp showed he\u2019s more interested in stunts than in addressing the needs of the American people. Poor Ryan and McConnell relegated to props. Sad!\u201d she added, referring to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, Trump said he would \u201cabsolutely blame the Democrats\u201d if a government shutdown takes place. A Dec. 8 deadline is looming for passing a spending measure needed to fund a wide range of federal government programs.Although Republicans control both chambers of the U.S. Congress, their leaders will likely need to rely on at least some Democratic votes to pass the measure. Democrats have said they will demand help for the \u201cDreamers\u201d - young people brought to the United States illegally as children - as part of their price for providing votes on the budget measure. But Trump said in a tweet late on Tuesday: \u201cI ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big. They can\u2019t now threaten a shutdown to get their demands.\u201d Congress has three choices: approve a massive bill for more than $1 trillion to keep the government operating through Sept. 30, 2018; pass a shorter extension of current funding to buy more time; or fail to pass anything and risk a partial government shutdown. On Capitol Hill, Schumer said he and Pelosi believed the best path forward would be to negotiate with Republican leaders in Congress instead of going to the White House for a \u201cshow meeting.\u201d ",

        "title": "'Fierce and formidable' Dlamini-Zuma eyes South Africa's presidency",
        "text": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is a fierce campaigner against racial inequality whose hostility to big business has rattled investors in South Africa. She is also one of two front runners to be the country s next president. The 68-year-old is vying to succeed her ex-husband, President Jacob Zuma, as leader of the ruling African National Congress at a party vote this weekend, an outcome that would make her favorite for the presidency after a parliamentary election due in 2019. A medical doctor and former chair of the Commission of the African Union, a pan-continental grouping, Dlamini-Zuma has pledged during her campaign to  radically  tackle the racial inequality that persists in South Africa 23 years after the end of white minority rule. Backers of her main rival, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, say she is peddling populist rhetoric and would rule in the mould of her former husband, whose decade in power has been plagued by corruption scandals. Dlamini-Zuma declined to be interviewed for this story. The choice between Dlamini-Zuma and Ramaphosa will influence South Africa s economic policy trajectory, as well the country s role in Africa and beyond. Graphic: ANC election in South Africa - here Graphic: South African economy - here Investors are worried by Dlamini-Zuma s hostility toward international companies, which she says form part of a  white monopoly capital  cabal dominating South Africa s wealth.  A Dlamini-Zuma victory would signal a sharp rhetorical shift toward more leftist economic policy,  said John Ashbourne, an Africa-focused economist at Capital Economics.  A further credit ratings downgrade would be almost inevitable.  Yet Dlamini-Zuma s supporters point to a commitment to changing the lives of South Africa s black majority. Lynne Jones, a psychiatrist and author who lived with Dlamini-Zuma when they were students together in the English city of Bristol in the 1970s, says her determination to fight injustice is rooted in her own personal story. Jones remembers a day four decades ago when Dlamini-Zuma lay on her bed and wept after being forced to miss her brother s funeral because the apartheid-era security services had hounded her out of South Africa.  She was fiercely intelligent and determined,  said Jones.  Here was someone who had put their whole life on the line and given up home and family for what they believed. It was eye-opening.  The race between Ramaphosa, a unionist-turned-millionaire businessman, and Dlamini-Zuma is too close to call, political analysts say. Her campaign team told Reuters in written comments it was confident she would be elected ANC leader. Ramaphosa, who is popular among swathes of the ANC disillusioned with Zuma, is promising to end corruption, boost a flatlining economy and deliver jobs to the poor in a country where more than a quarter of the population is unemployed. Dlamini-Zuma, by contrast, is an African nationalist and has the support of the influential ANC youth and women s leagues, which both tend to support socialist policies. Known for her fierce temper and hostility toward the West, she was described in one 2001 U.S. diplomatic cable on WikiLeaks as a  truculent and petulant foreign minister . Another cable to Washington suggested she could be charming.  Belying her reputation as fierce and formidable, the Minister was soft spoken and smiling in this meeting - articulate but gentle, candid but warm,  Donald Gips, then U.S. ambassador to South Africa, wrote in 2010.     The most common criticism of Dlamini-Zuma is that she is beholden to Zuma and his powerful patronage network. Zuma has publicly endorsed her.  She is bold and you can t fool her. She is someone you can trust,  Zuma told a rally recently.     The couple met in Swaziland in the 1980s, when they were both in the ANC underground. They were married for more than a decade and have four children together. In a rare interview last month, Dlamini-Zuma challenged her opponents to find any evidence of corruption in her long political career.  I don t loot government coffers. I ve never done so, and I will not do so,  she told ANN7 television. But for some senior figures in the ANC, she has not done enough to distance herself from the corruption scandals that have dogged President Zuma.  She has not said anything on  state capture ,  ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu told Reuters, using a South African term to describe private interests unduly controlling government funds. Dlamini-Zuma says accusations that she is piggy-backing off Zuma are  insulting  given her career, first as a doctor to ANC leaders fighting apartheid and then as a cabinet minister under every South African president since 1994. As health minister in Nelson Mandela s cabinet, she laid the foundations for free public healthcare for the poor, took a hard line on smoking and made medicines more accessible. As foreign minister she fostered friendships with African countries and emerging economies like China, even when this angered the West. But she also made errors of judgment. In 1996, Dlamini-Zuma awarded a contract for more than $3 million to a friend for a play, Sarafina II, to raise awareness about AIDS and was later found to have ignored tender rules.  Political analyst Ralph Mathekga said that paled in comparison to recent government malpractice. He said:  14 million rand in the Sarafina scandal now seems like peanuts when compared with the looting under Zuma.  ",

        "title": "U.S. puts more pressure on Pakistan to help with Afghan war",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States suggested on Tuesday it could cut U.S. aid to Pakistan or downgrade Islamabad\u2019s status as a major non-NATO ally to pressure the South Asian nation to do more to help it with the war in Afghanistan. A day after President Donald Trump committed to an open-ended conflict in Afghanistan and singled out Pakistan for harboring Afghan Taliban insurgents and other militants, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington\u2019s relationship with Pakistan would depend on its help against terrorism. \u201cWe are going to be conditioning our support for Pakistan and our relationship with them on them delivering results in this area,\u201d Tillerson told reporters.  U.S. officials are frustrated by what they see as Pakistan\u2019s reluctance to act against groups such as the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network that they believe exploit safe haven on Pakistani soil to launch attacks on neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan denies it harbors militants fighting U.S. and Afghan government forces in Afghanistan. Tillerson said the United States could consider withdrawing Pakistan\u2019s status as a major non-NATO ally, which provides limited benefits such as giving Pakistan faster access to surplus U.S. military hardware, if cooperation did not improve. \u201cWe have some leverage that\u2019s been discussed in terms of the amount of aid and military assistance we give them, their status as non-NATO alliance partner - all of that can be put on the table,\u201d he said. In a televised speech on Monday offering few specifics, Trump promised a stepped-up military campaign against Taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the U.S.-backed Afghan government and he singled out Pakistan for harboring militants. U.S.-backed Afghan forces overthrew the Taliban\u2019s hard-line Islamist government in late 2001 because it sheltered al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, architect of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington that year.  U.S. forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three American presidents. About 2,400 U.S. troops have died there in America\u2019s longest military conflict.   (For a graphic on U.S. troops and contractors in Afghanistan click tmsnrt.rs/2xm6CxQ)  The Afghan government welcomed Trump\u2019s speech, but the Taliban said it would make the country a \u201cgraveyard for the American empire.\u201d     Successive U.S. administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear-armed Pakistan, which has a porous border with Afghanistan. Washington fumes about inaction against the Taliban, but Pakistan has cooperated on other U.S. counterterrorism efforts, including against al Qaeda and Islamic State militants. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry said it was \u201cdisappointing that the US policy statement ignores the enormous sacrifices rendered by the Pakistani nation\u201d in fighting terrorism.  \u201cAs a matter of policy, Pakistan does not allow use of its territory against any country,\u201d it said.      A senior U.S. official said on Tuesday significant measures were under consideration, including possibly sanctioning Pakistani officials with ties to extremist organizations. Trump also called for Pakistan\u2019s great rival India to play a bigger role in Afghanistan, a prospect that will ring alarm bells for Pakistan\u2019s generals.     \u201cTrump\u2019s policy of engaging India and threatening action may actually constrain Pakistan and lead to the opposite of what he wants,\u201d said Zahid Hussain, a Pakistani security analyst. The United States has little choice but to use Pakistani roads and air corridors to resupply its troops in landlocked Afghanistan, giving Islamabad considerable leverage. U.S. officials fret that if Pakistan becomes an active foe, it could further destabilize Afghanistan and endanger U.S. soldiers.     Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday he was awaiting a plan from the U.S. military\u2019s chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, before deciding how many more troops to send to Afghanistan. \u201cWhen he brings that to me, I will determine how many more we need to send in,\u201d Mattis told reporters in Baghdad. \u201cIt may or may not be the number that is bandied about.\u201d U.S. officials have said Trump has given Mattis authority to send about 4,000 additional troops to add to the roughly 8,400 already in Afghanistan. The U.S. Air Force may intensify its strikes in Afghanistan and expand training of the Afghan air force following Trump\u2019s decision, its top general told Reuters on Tuesday. Most U.S. troops in Afghanistan work with a NATO-led training and advising mission, with the rest part of a counterterrorism force that mostly targets pockets of al Qaeda and Islamic State fighters.

        "title": "'Nowhere to hide': North Korean missiles spur anxiety in Japan fishing town",
        "text": "ERIMO, Japan (Reuters) - Ever since North Korea lobbed two missiles far above this windswept fishing town on Japan s northern island of Hokkaido, seaweed farmer Mitsuyo Kawamura says she s been on edge.  Now when I hear a loud sound, I look outside, I look out at the ocean,  68-year-old Kawamura said from her seaside cottage in Erimo, where she lays out long dark strands of kombu seaweed on stones to dry in the sun.  I feel anxious, like I never know when it will come again.  As Japan prepares to vote in Sunday s national election,   Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called North Korea s escalating threats   it also conducted a sixth nuclear test last month   a  national crisis  that only he can lead Japan through. Yet the missiles that flew over Erimo on Aug. 29 and Sept. 15 created an eerie threat: No one saw or heard them. They streaked by several hundred kilometers above land, too high to see with the naked eye, before splashing into the Pacific more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) to the east.  Warnings of the missiles spread through sirens and government-issued  J-alerts  on millions of cell phones throughout Japan, jolting some out of sleep. Kawamura has since stocked up on extra food and keeps the radio on to listen for more warnings. Like many residents here   and across Japan   she feels helpless, unsure of how to protect herself.  When it s launched, it could land here just moments later,  she said.  There s nowhere to hide.  Abe s rhetoric has grown harsher as North Korea has threatened to  sink  Japan and seems intent on developing nuclear warheads that can reach the U.S. mainland. He has repeatedly backed U.S. President Donald Trump s  all-options-on-the-table  stance and says now is not the time for dialogue.  They promised in 1994 and again in 2005 that they would abandon their nuclear program. But they have broken their word and developed nuclear devices and missiles,  Abe said at a campaign rally last week.  We re not going to be deceived anymore.  To protect itself, Japan has deployed 34 Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries around the country, including one in Hokkaido, and Aegis defense systems on several destroyers. U.S. forces in Japan also have ballistic missile defense equipment that can   if all goes well   take out a missile in mid-flight. The rockets thrust tiny Erimo, population 4,850, into the global spotlight. Maps on TV broadcasts showed the missiles  flight paths over nearby Cape Erimo, a jagged point that juts into the Pacific where seals frolic. At the town s docks, where fishermen sorted through the morning s haul of salmon, tossing them into vats of ice water, strong support for Abe was mixed with worries that he s too strident, putting Japan at risk.  Right now, no one s better than Abe,  said Satoru Narita, a 72-year-old fisherman. If anything, Japan has been too passive, said 23-year-old Ryosuke Kinoshita, who supports Abe s ruling Liberal Democratic Party.  Next time they launch one, I d almost like to see us fire one back,  he said.  We can t live in peace and safety.  But Haruki Suminoya, head of Erimo s fishing union, cautioned that being overly aggressive could provoke North Korea  into lashing out.  Abe s approach is too strong, too hardline,  he said.  A more restrained approach is better.  The recent war of words between Trump and North Korea unsettled many residents, who pointed out they were a much closer target than the United States. While pressure was needed toward North Korea, being too tough could be disastrous, said Mayor Masaki Ohnishi.  If North Korea does something serious, Japan is within shooting range.  So far, it seems that Abe is winning over voters. Nationwide polls show the LDP is headed for a big win this weekend. Erimo residents were divided on Abe s signature policy of  revising Japan s war-renouncing constitution to clarify the status of the country s military. Critics worry that it could lead to an expanded role for the armed forces overseas and entangle it in U.S.-led conflicts. But Shinto priest Hirotaka Tezuka, 39, said the constitution had grown outdated.  We need a constitution that s better suited to the present era.  Yoshihiro Naito, 77, opposed the idea.  The commitment we ve made not to wage war has kept Japan safe.  He plans to vote for an opposition party because he thinks Abe and the LDP have become too powerful.  Town officials said they have not taken any particular precautionary steps following the recent missile launches, nor do they plan any  duck and cover  drills that have been held elsewhere. The town has loud speakers on 50 tall poles to broadcast warnings for tsunamis, typhoons   and now missiles. In recent months, they have installed wireless units in 1,500 of the 2,200 homes so people can hear them when they are indoors.  Erimo also has emergency stocks of food, water and other supplies, the mayor said. That s particularly important for Erimo because it is linked to the rest of Hokkaido by only one coast-hugging road, which gets closed several times a year due to heavy rains or massive waves. Local fishermen are nervous about North Korea s warning that it might conduct a hydrogen bomb test over the Pacific, which they worry would contaminate the water like the Fukushima nuclear disaster did in 2011.  The radiation would make all the fish inedible,  said Narita, the elderly fisherman.  Like in Fukushima, we couldn t do our jobs.  The town s dwindling fishing industry has already been hit hard by a plunge in the salmon catch as well as by a dearth of youngsters to take over the trade. When young people move away to cities such as Sapporo, Hokkaido s capital, sometimes their parents follow them, residents said. Erimo s population, which peaked above 9,000 in the 1960s, has fallen to nearly half that level.  We re a fishing town,  said Naito,  so if we can t catch fish any more, we re finished.  ",

        "title": "Trudeau sees no flood of Americans to Canada if Trump wins",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday joked that he is not expecting an influx of unhappy Americans across the border if firebrand Republican Donald Trump becomes president. As Trump\u2019s popularity builds in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, Internet search providers have noted a spike in queries from Americans about moving to Canada.  Trudeau told students on the third day of an official visit to the United States, however, that the idea of emigration by voters who feared ending up on the losing side was common during U.S. election campaigns. \u201cIf over the past decades that had been the case, we\u2019d have more people in Canada than in the United States ... It becomes an easy thing to cry out,\u201d he said during a discussion at Washington\u2019s American University. Canada\u2019s population is just over a tenth the size of that of the United States. Trudeau said Canadians and Americans continually crossed the border to live in the other country. \u201cThat\u2019s just the nature of our friendship and relationship and to link it too much to politics is humorous ... There will always be flows back and forth and one must never fret or be disappointed with that,\u201d he said. Migration data from after Republican George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 election and 2004 re-election - other times when some liberal Americans pledged to move to Canada in protest \u2013 suggests few followed up on their promise. Trudeau, whose Liberals took power in Canada last November, had previously largely avoided questions about the consequences of a Trump victory, saying he will work with whomever wins. Earlier this week he said he would neither fight Trump nor support him but understood his appeal for people fed up with politics. Trudeau made his comments a day after talks at the White House that set the seal on better ties with the United States. Trudeau and President Barack Obama agreed joint steps to combat climate change and make it easier for people and goods to flow back and forth across their countries\u2019 long border. Trump has in the past mused about tearing up the North American Free Trade Agreement, which could cripple the Canadian economy. Keeping good relations with the United States is critical for Canada, which sends 75 percent of its exports to its southern neighbor. ",

        "title": "Powerful Koch brothers rebuff big donors' calls to back Trump for White House",
        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (Reuters) - The billionaire industrialist Koch brothers rejected pressure over the weekend from dozens of big donors in their sprawling political network to back U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, saying that their money was better spent trying to influence congressional races. The rejection deprives Trump, a New York businessman who has never previously run for elected office, of a major source of fundraising and reflects how his unorthodox White House bid has sparked some disarray among fundraisers who would normally be squarely behind a Republican nominee. The Kochs, with a nearly $300 million political warchest,  have earned a reputation as powerful allies in Republican politics.  Charles Koch, the dominant player in his political partnership with brother David Koch, told attendees at a bi-annual donor retreat at a luxury resort in Colorado Springs, Colorado: \u201cAt this point, I can\u2019t support either candidate\u201d for the White House.  He said network\u2019s mandate was to shore up \u201cthe country\u2019s financial future and eliminate corporate welfare,\u201d a reference to government subsidies provided to some industries. \u201cBut since it appears that neither presidential candidate is likely to support us in these efforts, we are focused on maximizing the number of principled leaders in the House and Senate who will,\u201d he said.  Trump\u2019s protectionist stances and pledges to review free trade agreements and to get tough on immigration have clashed with the Kochs\u2019 free-market political philosophy. Charles Koch has described as a \u201ca blood libel\u201d the idea he would instead support Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election. A group of wealthy Republican donors, who paid the minimum $100,000 per year to be members of the 700-strong Koch network, had been urging the brothers to step off the sidelines of the election and back Trump. The donors argued that if Trump is elected, the Koch network would want to have influence on his emerging policies and cabinet picks, and to have access to a Trump administration. Over cocktails on the patio overlooking the Rocky Mountains, in private meetings and on text message threads, some donors voiced their concern that if the Kochs alienate Trump, \u201cit could hurt us down the road.\u201d\u00a0  Some suggested that some donors could leave the Koch network over the decision not to back Trump. Oil magnate Harold Hamm, a leading candidate to serve as Trump\u2019s energy secretary, did not attend the weekend gathering. Other donors who had been at the forefront of a movement to urge the Kochs to get on board with Trump, like billionaire broadcasting magnate Stanley Hubbard, said that in a private meeting with Charles, they had now been convinced that the Kochs were \u201cdoing the right thing.\u201d   Trump has shown no hesitation in spurning the Kochs. On Friday, he tweeted that he had turned down an invitation to meet with the brothers. Koch insiders quickly disputed that characterization, saying an invite was never extended.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nonetheless, the Koch brothers also did not act to stop Trump from beating 16 presidential rivals and winning the party nomination. During the primary contests, many Koch donors were urging the brothers to perform a \u201cTrump Intervention,\u201d whereby the brothers would leverage their political operation to support Trump\u2019s rivals. The Kochs refused. Trump officially accepted the Republican nomination in Cleveland last month, with a speech that painted a bleak picture of rising crime at home and increasing threats from overseas. The top Koch official on criminal justice reform, Mark Holden, said the speech was inaccurate. \u201cWe are safer (now),\u201d he said. ",

        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - A break-in at the U.N. human rights office in Burundi s capital may have been an attempt to smear the government, a  presidential aide told reporters on Friday in Geneva. U.N. staff in Burundi filed a complaint with police after a group of armed men broke into the office in Bujumbura at around 2.30 a.m. on Wednesday, a U.N. spokeswoman said.  Nobody was hurt and there was no damage in the attack, which came a week after a U.N. human rights inquiry said Burundian officials at the highest level should be held accountable for crimes against humanity. Willy Nyamitwe, senior communications officer in the office of the president, said the two guards at the office had been arrested and it was probably not a simple burglary.  What the police have already said is apparently there was no attack coming from the outside, which certainly means the guards would seem to be complicit. But ... we should wait for the final conclusions of this investigation.  Nyamitwe is expected to respond to the allegations at the U.N. Human Rights Council next week. Burundi has rejected the findings of the U.N. inquiry, which Nyamitwe said was a puppet of the European Union. U.N. human rights spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell called for an investigation of the break-in that complied with international legal procedures. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted nearly unanimously on Thursday for legislation to impose new sanctions on Russia and force President Donald Trump to get Congress\u2019 approval before easing any existing sanctions on Russia. In a move that could complicate U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s desire for warmer relations with Moscow, the Senate backed the measure by 98-2. Republican Senator Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, were the only two \u201cno\u201d votes. The measure is intended to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, its annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region and support for Syria\u2019s government in the six-year-long civil war. If passed in the House of Representatives and signed into law by Trump, it would put into law sanctions previously established via former President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders, including some on Russian energy projects. The legislation also allows new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways and targets Russians guilty of conducting cyber attacks or supplying weapons to Syria\u2019s government. \u201cThe legislation sends a very, very strong signal to Russia, the nefarious activities they\u2019ve been involved in,\u201d Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said as lawmakers debated the measure. If the measure became law, it could complicate relations with some countries in Europe. Germany and Austria said the new punitive measures could expose European companies involved in projects in Russia to fines. The legislation sets up a review process that would require Trump to get Congress\u2019 approval before taking any action to ease, suspend or lift any sanctions on Russia. Trump was especially effusive about Russian president Vladimir Putin during the 2016 U.S. election campaign, though his openness to closer ties to Moscow has tempered somewhat, with his administration on the defensive over investigations into Russian meddling in the election. Putin dismissed the proposed sanctions, saying they reflected an internal political struggle in the United States, and that Washington\u2019s policy of imposing sanctions on Moscow had always been to try to contain Russia. The bill also includes new sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile program and other activities not related to the international nuclear agreement reached with the United States and other world powers. To become law, the legislation must pass the House of Representatives and be signed by Trump. House aides said they expected the chamber would begin to debate the measure in coming weeks.  However, they could not predict if it would come up for a final vote before lawmakers leave Washington at the end of July for their summer recess. Senior aides told Reuters they expected some sanctions package would eventually pass, but they expected the measure would be changed in the House. The Trump administration has pushed back against the bill, and his fellow Republicans hold a commanding 238- to 193-seat majority in the chamber. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson questioned the legislation on Wednesday, urging Congress to ensure that any sanctions package \u201callows the president to have the flexibility to adjust sanctions to meet the needs of what is always an evolving diplomatic situation.\u201d Previously, U.S. energy sanctions had only targeted Russia\u2019s future high-tech energy projects, such as drilling for oil in the Arctic, fracking and offshore drilling. They blocked U.S. companies such as Exxon Mobil, where Tillerson was chairman, from investing in such projects. The new bill would slap sanctions on companies in other countries looking to invest in those projects in the absence of U.S. companies, a practice known as backfilling. Also included for the first time are discretionary measures the Trump administration could impose on investments by companies in Western countries on Russia energy export pipelines to Europe. The Senate also voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to add provisions to the bill allowing the U.S. space agency NASA to continue using Russian-made rocket engines and the 100 senators voted unanimously for an amendment reaffirming the U.S. commitment to the NATO alliance.

        "title": "Trump leads Republican field nationally by more than 20 points: poll",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump has taken a more than 20-point lead over U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Republican race for the presidential nomination, bolstering his position ahead of the party\u2019s primary in South Carolina on Saturday, according to a national Reuters/Ipsos poll. Among Republicans, Trump, a billionaire businessman, drew 40 percent support in the poll conducted from Saturday to Wednesday, compared with 17 percent for Cruz, 11 percent for U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, 10 percent for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and 8 percent for former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. The results contrasted with those of a national poll conducted this week by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal that showed Trump dropping into a national dead heat with Cruz in the race for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. On the Democratic side, the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton maintaining about a 10-point national lead over U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont since last week\u2019s New Hampshire primary won by Sanders. The Republican results marked a nominal gain for Trump since his win in the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary, when he led Cruz by 18.4 points in the national rolling survey, although the increase remained within the poll\u2019s credibility interval. Since he announced his candidacy last summer, Trump has leveraged his celebrity and deep pockets to wage an unfiltered campaign that has upended the Republican primary. He has led the Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll since nearly the start of his campaign, topping Bush in late July. The Reuters/Ipsos poll also showed that either Clinton or Sanders would win a hypothetical general election contest with Trump. Clinton would likely win with 44 percent support,  compared with 37 percent for Trump. Sanders would likely win by 44 percent to 35 percent. The poll included responses from 476 registered Republicans and 543 registered Democrats. It had a credibility interval of about 5 percent.

        "text": "MOGADISHU (Reuters) - An air strike hit a village south of Somalia s capital Mogadishu on Wednesday and a local official said the attack targeted Islamist al Shabaab militants fighting to topple the country s central government. It was not immediately clear who had carried out the air strike but the United States frequently conducts such attacks  to bolster Somalia s army in its fight against al Shabaab.  A local government official told Reuters the strike occurred in Ilimey village, about 130 km (80 miles) southwest of Mogadishu. The area is mostly controlled by al Shabaab. The target, he said, was a car used by the militants to transport supplies to a squad preparing bombs.   The strike hit the car ... but we do not know details of casualties,  Ali Nur, deputy governor of Somalia s lower Shabelle region told Reuters. But Mohamed Abu Usama, al Shabaab s governor for the same region, denied that al Shabaab personnel had been attacked and instead said the strike had killed civilians.   The strike hit a makeshift tea shop and thus killed 7 civilians and injured three others,  he said. Somalia has been trapped in chaos and lawlessness since 1991 when dictator Siad Barre was toppled. Al Shabaab wants to topple the Western-backed central government and establish its own rule based on its strict interpretation of Islam s sharia law.   An African Union peace keeping force AMISOM pushed the group from Mogadishu and other former strongholds.  But the Islamists remain a formidable force, carrying out frequent bombings and other assaults on AMISOM, Somali army and civilian targets.  In October over 500 people died in one of Somalia s deadliest bombings when a truck bomb exploded outside a busy hotel at Mogadishu s K5 intersection lined with government offices, restaurants and kiosks. A second blast struck Medina district two hours later. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of Republican and Democratic U.S. senators introduced legislation on Wednesday that would provide an additional 2,500 visas for Afghans who have assisted U.S. forces by working as interpreters or in other support functions, often risking their lives. The U.S. State Department said last week it would soon run out of visas for the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program, designed to help bring to the United States those who have worked for the government during the decade and a half that U.S. forces have been engaged in the country. The U.S. embassy in Kabul has stopped scheduling interviews for applicants seeking a visa through the program. The bill was introduced by Republican Senators John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Thom Tillis, and Democrats Jack Reed, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, and Jeanne Shaheen. Tillis and Shaheen are also members of the panel. The four senators led efforts in the Senate to extend the Afghan SIV program last year. \u201cThis legislation would ensure the continuation of this vital Special Immigrant Visa program, and send a clear message that America will not turn its back on those \u2014 who at great personal risk \u2014 stand with us in the fight against terror,\u201d McCain said in a statement. The National Defense Authorization Act passed late last year added 1,500 visas to the program, while tightening requirements for eligibility. Shaheen\u2019s office said more than 10,000 applicants are still in the process of obtaining visas. The Afghan visa announcement came as U.S. officials prepared to implement President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, effective this week, that temporarily bans the admission of refugees and some travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. Afghanistan is not one of the six but some members of Congress have resisted expanding the SIV program out of concern that militants could use it to enter the United States. Supporters of the program dismiss the concerns, noting that  applicants are subjected to intense screening. ",

        "title": "Opposition wants Russian pressure for Syria deal within six months",
        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - Syria s opposition wants Russia and other states to put pressure on President Bashar al-Assad to engage in peace talks in Geneva to produce a political solution within six months, the chief of its delegation said at the start of negotiations on Wednesday.  We want more pressure on the regime to engage in the negotiation and continue in the negotiation to reach a political solution in six months, as (U.N. Security Council Resolution) 2254 says,  Nasr Hariri told Reuters.  Just speaking about a political transition without any advancement, we will lose our trust in the process and our people will lose their trust in us and in the process itself.  Hariri said Syria and its ally Iran wanted the fighting to continue until they could declare a military victory, and they were not abiding by agreements to de-escalate the fighting in areas such as Eastern Ghouta, a besieged rebel-held enclave.  If the situation continues as it is now I think there is great danger in these agreements.   Russia had arranged a pause in the fighting for Eastern Ghouta for two or three days, which showed Moscow had the power to ensure de-escalation agreements were respected, he said.  A war monitor and a witness said on Wednesday that heavy shelling hit Eastern Ghouta in spite of the start of the Russian-backed truce there. Syria s civil war is now in its seventh year and previous rounds of negotiations made virtually no progress, with no direct contact between the opposing delegations, who took turns to meet U.N. mediator Staffan de Mistura. The Syrian government delegation has always rejected the opposition s demand that Assad leave power, calling them  terrorists  who lacked the legitimacy to negotiate. The government s position on the battlefield has strengthened dramatically since Russia joined the war on Assad s behalf two years ago, raising speculation that the opposition could soften its negotiating stance. However, opposition delegates meeting last week issued a statement repeating their demand that Assad be excluded from any transitional government, a position which Damascus and its allies say is divorced from reality on the ground. De Mistura originally planned a round of 4-5 days but was now planning to continue until Dec. 15, Hariri said, adding that his team had come hoping for direct talks with the government delegation for the first time. Hariri said his opening words to government negotiator Bashar al-Ja afari would be:  I hope despite all of the crimes which have been done in Syria, I hope that the regime can come ready to put the people of Syria first.  De Mistura has asked both sides to come without preconditions. Hariri said the opposition had no preconditions, but planned to talk about Assad s future as part of the negotiations. The talks are meant to cover four major issues: elections, governance, the constitution and fighting terrorism. All four would be discussed, Hariri said, but it would not be possible to go straight into the core elements straightaway.   If we will speak about constitution or election under the current circumstances inside Syria with this kind of regime, I think it will be impossible,  he said. Among issues the opposition wanted to discuss at the outset were humanitarian aid and people detained by forces loyal to Assad. Hariri said detainees number more than 200,000. Syrian government negotiator Ja afari also met de Mistura on Wednesday but declined to speak to reporters afterwards. ",

        "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council urged the Myanmar government on Monday to  ensure no further excessive use of military force in Rakhine state,  where violence has forced more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee the Buddhist-majority Asian country. The United Nations has denounced the violence during the past 10 weeks as a classic example of ethnic cleansing. The Myanmar government has denied allegations of ethnic cleansing. To appease council veto powers Russia and China, Britain and France dropped a push for the Security Council to adopt a resolution on the situation and the 15-member body instead unanimously agreed on a formal statement. The council expressed  grave concern over reports of human rights violations and abuses in Rakhine State, including by the Myanmar security forces, in particular against persons belonging to the Rohingya community.   The Security Council calls upon the Government of Myanmar to ensure no further excessive use of military force in Rakhine State, to restore civilian administration and apply the rule of law, and to take immediate steps in accordance with their obligations and commitments to respect human rights,  it said.  Myanmar has been stung by international criticism for the way its security forces responded to attacks by Rohingya militants on 30 security posts. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since Aug. 25.   The Security Council stresses the primary responsibility of the Government of Myanmar to protect its population including through respect for the rule of law and the respect, promotion and protection of human rights,  the statement said. It stressed the importance of transparent investigations into allegations of human rights abuses and  in this regard, the Security Council calls upon the Government of Myanmar to cooperate with all relevant United Nations bodies, mechanisms and instruments.   Myanmar has refused entry to a U.N. panel that was tasked with investigating allegations of abuses after a smaller military counteroffensive launched in October 2016. Myanmar s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has pledged accountability for rights abuses and says Myanmar will accept back refugees who can prove they were residents of Myanmar. The Security Council said it was alarmed by the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Rakhine state and warned that the increasing number of refugees  has a destabilizing impact in the region.   The council demanded that the Myanmar government allow immediate, safe and unhindered humanitarian aid and media access. It asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to report back in 30 days on the situation. ",

        "title": "Seoul says North Korea puts Washington in range, but needs to prove critical technology",
        "text": "SEOUL/MOSCOW (Reuters) - North Korea s latest missile test puts Washington within range, but Pyongyang still needs to prove it has mastered critical missile technology, such as re-entry, terminal stage guidance and warhead activation, South Korea said on Friday. South Korea s Ministry of Defence said the Hwasong-15 missile tested on Wednesday was a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) which can fly over 13,000 km (8,080 miles), placing Washington within target range. The test prompted a warning from the United States that North Korea s leadership would be  utterly destroyed  if war were to break out, a statement that drew sharp criticism from Russia. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov termed the threat from U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley  a bloodthirsty tirade  and said military action against Pyongyang would be a big mistake, Russian news agencies reported.  We will do everything to ensure that (the use of force) doesn t happen so that the problem is decided only using peaceful and political-diplomatic means,  Lavrov said. Separately, Russian lawmakers just back from a visit to Pyongyang said North Korea was not prepared to disarm, and while it did not want nuclear war it was morally ready for it, Russia s RIA news agency reported. Pyongyang has said its Wednesday missile test was a  breakthrough  and leader Kim Jong Un said the country had  finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force.  After North Korea released video footage and photographs of Hwasong-15, U.S. based experts said it appeared North Korea was indeed capable of delivering a nuclear weapon anywhere in the United States and could only be two or three tests away from being combat ready. Yeo Suk-joo, South Korea s deputy minister of defense policy, told the South Korean parliament that North Korea still needed to prove some technologies, like re-entry, terminal stage guidance and warhead activation. Even so, South Korea s Unification Ministry said North Korea was likely to pause its missile tests for a number of reasons, including the northern hemisphere winter season.  For now if there are no sudden changes in situation or external factors, we feel there is a high chance North Korea will refrain from engaging in provocations for a while,  said Lee Yoo-jin, the ministry s deputy spokeswoman. North Korea is known to test fewer missiles in the fourth quarter of the year as troops are called to help with harvests, while the cold temperatures are a strain on the country s fuel supplies. This week s missile launch was the first in 75 days. South Korea Defence Minister Song Young-moo told parliament  he expected North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to use his New Year s Address to declare that North Korea had completed its weapons program. South Korean and U.S. officials say the Hwasong 15 is the most advanced missile North Korea has ever tested. Yeo told lawmakers the first stage engine of the missile featured a clustering of two engines from a smaller Hwasong-14 ICBM test-launched in July. He said the Hwasong-15 is two meters (six feet) longer than the Hwasong-14. He said the second-stage engine requires further analysis. Yeo said U.S. strategic assets would continue to be rotated on and near the Korean peninsula until the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea next February in a bid to deter further North Korean  provocations.  U.S. President Donald Trump has responded to the latest North Korean test with a fresh round of insults directed against Kim Jong Un, who he called  Little Rocket Man  and a  sick puppy.  Trump has vowed to respond with tougher sanctions, but his administration has warned that all options are on the table in dealing with North Korea, including military ones. North Korea has stuck to its effort to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States in spite of  years of international sanctions and condemnation. ",

        "title": "Factbox: Trump fills top jobs for his administration",
        "text": "(Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump will nominate high-frequency trading expert Vincent Viola to be secretary of the Army, a senior transition official said on Monday. Below is a list of Republican Trump\u2019s selections for top jobs in his administration. Senate confirmation is required for all the posts except national security adviser, White House chief of staff, White House director of the National Economic Council and White House strategist. Tillerson, 64, has spent his entire career at Exxon Mobil Corp, where he rose to serve as its chairman and CEO in 2006. A civil engineer by training, the Texan joined the world\u2019s largest energy company in 1975 and led several of its operations in the United States as well as in Yemen, Thailand and Russia. As Exxon\u2019s chief executive, he maintained close ties with Moscow and opposed U.S. sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Crimea. Mnuchin, 53, is a successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002. He assembled an investor group to buy a failed California mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as OneWest Bank and built it into Southern California\u2019s largest bank. Housing advocacy groups criticized the bank for its foreclosure practices, accusing it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Mattis is a retired Marine general known for his tough talk, distrust of Iran and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. A former leader of Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, Mattis, 66, is known by many U.S. forces by his nickname \u201cMad Dog.\u201d He was in 2005 rebuked for saying: \u201cIt\u2019s fun to shoot some people.\u201d Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump\u2019s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. Son of a country store owner, the Alabama senator and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  Zinke, 55, a first-term Republican representative and a member of the House subcommittee on natural resources, has voted for legislation that would weaken environmental safeguards on public lands. He has taken stances favoring coal, which suffered during the Obama administration. The League of Conservation Voters, which ranks lawmakers on their environmental record, gave Zinke an extremely low lifetime score of 3 percent. Ross, 79, heads the private equity firm W.L. Ross & Co and Forbes has pegged his net worth at about $2.9 billion. A staunch supporter of Trump, Ross helped shape the Trump campaign\u2019s views on trade policy. He blames the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which went into force in 1994, and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization, for causing massive U.S. factory job losses.               Puzder, chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc [APOLOT.UL], which runs the Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s fast-food chains, has been a vociferous critic of government regulation of the workplace and the National Labor Relations Board. Puzder, 66, has argued that higher minimum wages would hurt workers by forcing restaurants to close and praises the benefits of automation, so his appointment is likely to antagonize organized labor.  U.S. Representative Price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House Budget Committee. A representative from Georgia since 2005, Price has criticized Obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. He is opposed to abortion. Carson, 65, is a retired neurosurgeon who dropped out of the Republican presidential nominating race in March and threw his support to Trump. A popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, Carson previously indicated reluctance to take a position in the incoming administration because of his lack of experience in the federal government. Carson is the first African-American picked for a Cabinet spot by Trump. Chao, 63, was labor secretary under President George W. Bush for eight years and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. She is a director at Ingersoll Rand, News Corp and Vulcan Materials Co. She is married to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky. Perry, 66, adds to the list of oil drilling advocates skeptical about climate change who have been picked for senior positions in Trump\u2019s Cabinet. The selections have worried environmentalists but cheered an oil and gas industry eager for expansion. Perry, who also briefly ran in the 2016 presidential race, would be responsible for U.S. energy policy and oversee the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons program.  DeVos, 58, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for expansion of charter schools. The final leadership role of Kelly\u2019s 45-year military career was head of the U.S. Southern Command, responsible for U.S. military activities and relationships in Latin America and the Caribbean. The 66-year-old retired Marine general differed with Obama on key issues and has warned of vulnerabilities along the United States\u2019 southern border with Mexico. Recently re-elected to serve as Republican National Committee chairman, Priebus will give up his party post to join Trump in the White House, where the low-key Washington operative could help forge ties with Congress to advance Trump\u2019s agenda. Priebus, 44, was a steadfast supporter of Trump during the presidential campaign even as the party fractured amid the choice. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ADMINISTRATOR: SCOTT PRUITT An ardent opponent of President Barack Obama\u2019s measures to stem climate change, Oklahoma Attorney General Pruitt, 48, has enraged environmental activists. But he fits with the president-elect\u2019s promise to cut the agency back and eliminate regulation that he says is stifling oil and gas drilling. Pruitt became the top state prosecutor for Oklahoma, which has extensive oil reserves, in 2011 and has challenged the EPA multiple times since. U.S. Representative Mick Mulvaney, 49, a South Carolina Republican, is a fiscal conservative. He was an outspoken critic of former House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, who resigned in 2015 amid opposition from fellow Republicans who were members of the House Freedom Caucus. Mulvaney was first elected to Congress in 2010. Haley, 44, has been the Republican governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. The daughter of Indian immigrants, she led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman. McMahon, 68, is a co-founder and former chief executive of the professional wrestling franchise WWE, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut. She ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for a U.S. Senate seat in Connecticut in 2010 and 2012 and was an early supporter of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. U.S. Representative Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. government\u2019s sweeping collection of Americans\u2019 communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran.     Cohn, 56, president and chief operating officer of investment bank Goldman Sachs, had widely been considered heir apparent to Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of the Wall Street firm. Trump hammered Goldman and Blankfein during the presidential campaign, releasing a television ad that called Blankfein part of a \u201cglobal power structure\u201d that had robbed America\u2019s working class. Retired Lieutenant General Flynn, 57, was an early Trump supporter and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his Army career in 1981 and was deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under President Barack Obama but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obama\u2019s foreign policy. Viola, 60, is a West Point graduate and U.S. Army veteran who served in the 101st Airborne Division. He founded high-frequency trading firm Virtu Financial Inc and served as  chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where he began his financial services career. After the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, Viola helped found the Combating Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He is an owner of the Florida Panthers ice hockey team. CHIEF WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST, SENIOR COUNSELOR: STEVE BANNON The former head of the conservative website Breitbart News came aboard as Trump\u2019s campaign chairman in August. A rabble-rousing conservative media figure, he helped shift Breitbart into a forum for the alt-right, a loose confederation of those who reject mainstream politics and includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. His hiring signals Trump\u2019s dedication to operating outside the norms of Washington. As White House chief of staff, Bannon, 63, will serve as Trump\u2019s gatekeeper and agenda-setter. ",

        "title": "Jockeying for cash: North Korea allows racetrack gambling as sanctions bite",
        "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Punters in North Korea who once risked three years hard labor for gambling are now able to bet on local horse races as the isolated country scrambles to unearth new sources of hard currency amid intensifying international sanctions. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been building resorts, swimming pools and other luxurious leisure facilities in what experts say is a bid to capture some of the individual wealth generated by growing private markets for goods and services. A series of races took place at the Mirim Horse Riding Club, one of Kim s flagship leisure developments, near Pyongyang on Sunday, according to North Korea s official KCNA news agency. Race goers aged 12 or older were allowed to bet on jockeys in a raffle-type system, broadcaster Korean Central Television said on Friday ahead of the races. Pictures from KCNA showed hundreds of spectators watching and filming with their phones as a field of mostly white-grey horses and their riders stormed out of the starting gate. In the communist North, horses - especially white ones - have traditionally been a propaganda symbol associated with the ruling Kim family.       Kim has been pushing for vanity projects for a theme park, sky resort and the horse riding club for the sake of propping up the people s well-being but their real purpose was to earn foreign currency,  said Na Jeong-won, head of the North Korea Industry-Economy Research Institute in Seoul.  North Korea s access to foreign currency has been impacted by a series of international sanctions over its nuclear weapons program, including bans on key exports such as coal, textiles and seafood. Lee Sang-keun, a researcher at the Institute of Unification Studies of Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said the primary target for the leisure facilities is affluent North Koreans.   You may have ridiculed Kim Jong Un for constructing lavish facilities while struggling to feed the people, but those things are to make foreign currency, not from foreigners but from the well-offs inside North Korea because you have to pay in U.S. dollars or Chinese renminbi there,  said Lee.   Many North Koreans make lots of money from the market, dine at hamburger restaurants and go shopping, all of which help fatten regime coffers. That s part of the reason why the regime still has some financial latitude despite international sanctions.  North Korea has already been operating casinos for foreigners in Pyongyang and Rason, where it jointly runs a special economic zone with China. Last March, the government sent out investment proposals for new casinos in Namyang, near the border of China, and the Mount Kumkang region, home to a scenic tourist resort just north of the border with South Korea. The United Nations  latest round of sanctions, however, bans any further joint ventures with North Korean companies. Third generation leader Kim developed the Mirim riding club by transforming a military horseman training center in 2012 and visited the site several times until its formal unveiling a year later, KCNA has reported. The Mirim riding club has an indoor training facility, seven outdoor riding courses, a pavilion, restaurants and a sauna, as well as 120 horses including 67 famous Orlov Trotters from Russia, according to the website of Uri Tours, a U.S.-based agency specialized in guided trips through the North. The entrance fee is $35, which covers one-hour of horse riding with an instructor, riding gear and sauna.  The fee could be lower for North Koreans, reportedly at around $10 - still a hefty sum for many impoverished locals.  There seems to be growing demand for such leisure activities among North Koreans as the gap between the rich and the poor has been widening,  said Na. ",

        "text": "HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s stock market has shed $6 billion while its main index has slumped 40 percent since last Wednesday when the military seized power leading to the fall of Robert Mugabe, stock exchange data showed on Thursday. The main industrial index was at 315.12 points compared with 527.27 points on Wednesday last week when the military announced its takeover and put former president Mugabe under house arrest. On Thursday the index fell 4.4 percent. The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange had been on a rapid rise in the last two months, driven by investors seeking a safe haven for their investment amid fears of a return to hyperinflation in an economy suffering acute shortages of foreign exchange. But analysts said the market had entered a period of correction on investor optimism of a change in economic policy in a post-Mugabe era.  Market capitalization was $9 billion, down from $15 billion last week, bourse data showed. On the currency front, black market rates for buying cash dollars softened further on Thursday.  Buying $100 using electronic transfer cost $150, down from $180 last week. Some black market traders said they were not buying dollars at all, anticipating further softening of rates. Zimbabwe adopted the U.S. dollar in 2009, along with Britain s pound and the South African rand, to tame inflation that topped out at 500 billion percent.   The market is adjusting back to reality,  an analyst at a Harare-based asset management company said.  The gains that we had seen were being fueled by an outlook of a return to hyperinflation, continued isolation of Zimbabwe by international lenders as well as well as a depressed economic outlook.  An analyst at a local stockbrocking firm said Mnangagwa had hit the right notes with his speech on Wednesday. Mnangagwa said he wanted to grow the economy, create jobs and for Zimbabwe to re-engage the international community as the country has faced isolation since 1999 when it defaulted on its debt with the International Monetary Fund. Most of Zimbabwe s 13 million people remain poor and face currency shortages and sky-high unemployment, something Mnangagwa promised to address. ",

        "title": "'Made in Syria': Refugees in Germany drive exports from home",
        "text": "HAMBURG (Reuters) - Many Syrian refugees in Germany have resigned themselves to the reality that there will be no swift return to the land of their birth, where a civil war is nearing the start of its eighth year. They are starting to build new lives in their host country, driving up demand for  Made in Syria  goods there as they seek to soothe homesickness with a precious slice of their old lives. Products popular among the half a million Syrians, who mainly arrived over the last three years, range from nuts, sweets and sesame paste to clothes, vertical spinning grillers used to make shawarma meat in diners and hair removal wax.  People want the very same things they were used to in Syria,  said trader Anas Msouty, sitting in his dim underground office near Hamburg Port as workers sorted out parcels of baklawa sweets and clothes that had just arrived from Syria.  The German market is full of similar products from Turkey, but Syrians want Syrian (goods),  added the father-of-six, who had to abandon his Islamic women s clothing factory outside Damascus when he fled the country. Orders have grown 25-fold since Msouty set up his trading firm Sajeda three months after his arrival in Germany in early 2016. He now imports 25 tonnes of Syrian goods a month. He is not alone in capitalizing on this trend; dozens of Syrian restaurants, stores and supermarkets have sprung up in all major German cities over the past two years, with more opening every month. In Berlin alone, at least half a dozen new Syrian eateries and as many supermarkets have opened this year.  The rise in demand for Syrian goods is contributing to a gradual revival in Syrian exports to Germany, which has taken in more Syrian refugees than any other Western nation. Exports from Syria rose to 15.5 million euros ($17.9 million) in 2016 and totaled 8 million euros in the first five months of this year alone, according to official German data. This is still a far cry from the pre-war level when non-oil Syrian exports to Germany totaled around $100 million a year. More than 5 million Syrians - almost a quarter of the pre-war population - have fled the Middle Eastern nation, according to the United Nations. It is unclear how much support rising demand for Syrian goods among refugee populations in Germany and elsewhere may be having on Syria s shattered economy. Little data is available from the war zone. The revival in trade in Germany nonetheless appears to have coincided with a bottoming out of economic activity in Syria.  The World Bank estimates the country s gross domestic product contracted by an accumulated 61 percent in 2011-2015, but in 2016 it shrunk by only 2 percent, though it mainly puts the improvement down to a slowing in the population exodus. Msouty, who supplies Syrian individuals and businesses in Germany, said he was proud of his contribution to recovering Syrian exports, which he said is providing much-needed income to factory owners and workers in Syria.  We are resuscitating the Syrian economy,  he said.  In Berlin, the boulevard of Sonnenallee - dubbed  Arab Street  for its abundance of Arabic shop signs - has become one of the most popular shopping destinations and hangouts for the capital s Syrian refugees. It boasts three Syrian supermarkets, two Syrian restaurants and one Syrian sweet shop, which have all opened over the past two years.  This is just a smell of home,  said Houda Bayyad, a veiled young mother shopping at one of the supermarkets, which opened in recent weeks.  It doesn t solve our problems like learning German and finding a job. But it makes our life here easier,  said the 20-year-old, holding a jar of Makdous, a Syrian delicacy of baby aubergines stuffed with walnuts, garlic and sun-dried red peppers pickled in olive oil.  Most Syrian goods come from factories in areas under government control mainly in and around Damascus but also from Aleppo. Three companies in Damascus that supply Msouty with goods declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The products are transported in trucks through relatively safe areas under government control to the port of Latakia in northern Syria and loaded onto container ships bound for Hamburg. Other products come by plane via Beirut. This trade is proving indispensable for Syrians setting up  businesses in Germany.  Sweet shops, and coffee and nut roasters, need specialized machines to make sweet and salty delights such as baklawa and roasted kernels. They prefer to import equipment from Syria as it is cheaper than to buy them in Germany from European or Turkish manufacturers. Restaurateurs depend on specialty raw ingredients to recreate the flavors that Syrians crave. L Amira Falafel, a Syrian restaurant in Hamburg that opened in 2015, has proved so popular that it has now opened at a second location in the northern city.   Our main goal was to make sure that everything we prepare tastes like in Syria,  said Mohammad Abou Saeed, co-owner of the eateries where it is hard to find a table any time of the day.  To do that we needed the same sesame paste, pickles and spices we used in Syria,  he added, gesturing at a waiter to bring baked bread to a couple who had just walked in.   It makes us very happy when diners tell us our food reminds them of Syria.   ",

        "text": "KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo s main opposition parties have rejected a new date for elections announced at the weekend to replace President Joseph Kabila, saying it violates the law and a political deal agreed with the government. Originally scheduled for late 2016, the polls have been repeatedly delayed. Following several rounds of deadly protests, Kabila s camp and his opponents signed an accord last December agreeing to hold the election before the end of this year. On Sunday, Congo s CENI elections commission announced that the election, which term limits currently bar Kabila from taking part in, will be held on Dec. 23, 2018 with the winner to be sworn in on Jan. 13, 2019.  The calendar presented by the CENI violates the Constitution, the Dec. 31, 2016 accord and electoral law,  read a statement from opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi s Rassemblement coalition.  The document was also agreed to by the MLC and UNC opposition parties. Dozens died in protests against Kabila s refusal to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate last December. Unrest sparked by the uncertainty surrounding the polls has raised fears Congo could witness a repeat of the kind of violence that killed millions around the turn of the last century, mostly from hunger and disease.  After the CENI said last month that the vote could only take place in April 2019 at the earliest, the opposition warned that the population would  take matters into its own hands .  The opposition leaders call upon all the Congolese people to be vigilant and mobilized in the aim of freeing up the electoral process by Dec. 31, 2017,  Tuesday s Rassemblement statement said. It nonetheless went on to state that the coalition believed it was possible to hold the vote by June 30 next year at the latest. The CENI and government officials blame poll delays on problems registering millions of voters across the vast Central African nation. The opposition accuses Kabila of manipulating the process to cling to power. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives will adopt mandatory training on sexual harassment and discrimination, Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday after members of Congress shared stories of women being propositioned and groped in the halls of the U.S. Capitol. \u201cOur goal is not only to raise awareness, but also make abundantly clear that harassment in any form has no place in this institution,\u201d the Republican speaker said in a statement. Ryan announced the new policy as a first step in the House\u2019s review of sexual harassment policies after women lawmakers related in unflinching detail accounts of harassment and intimidation by House members and staff in Congress. The Committee on House Administration held a hearing on sexual harassment policies against a backdrop of social outrage over sexual misconduct by powerful men that began with allegations by multiple women against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. He has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Roy Moore, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate from Alabama, has faced allegations by five women accusing him of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers. Ryan and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell have urged Moore to drop out of the race. Moore has denied the allegations. U.S. Representative Jackie Speier told the panel that two current House members, a Republican and a Democrat, had engaged in sexual harassment. She did not identify the lawmakers. She said numerous staff members, both men and women, had been subjected to inexcusable and often illegal behavior. They included \u201cpropositions such as \u2018Are you going to be a good girl?\u2019 to perpetrators exposing their genitals, to victims having their private parts grabbed on the House floor,\u201d she said. Speier later told MSNBC: \u201cWe do know that about $15 million has been paid out by the House on behalf of harassers in the last 10 to 15 years,\u201d including one taxpayer-funded settlement on behalf of one of the current House members.  About 1,500 former congressional staffers have urged the House and Senate leadership to address the issue. The Senate passed a resolution last week to require training. Democratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a lead sponsor of that measure, said the next step was to make changes in how harassment complaints are handled. \u201cYou wonder why there\u2019s only 21 women in the Senate or why there\u2019s no women running Hollywood studios or there\u2019s hardly any women running major businesses,\u201d Klobuchar told reporters. \u201cWell, when you have a work environment where people can\u2019t get ahead without having to put out, that\u2019s what happens.\u201d  ",

Parliament, which is dominated by the Georgian Dream Party, adopted the new draft last week over objections from Margvelashvili and the opposition. Under this new proposed new constitution, direct elections for president would be abolished from 2024, the country would transfer to full proportional parliamentary representation and the system of electoral blocs would be scrapped. In a televised statement, Margvelashvili, who was elected in 2013 for a five-year term, said he remained in favor of direct presidential elections rather than a system in which the president would be appointed by parliament. He said he had proposed to the parliamentary majority to allow parties to form electoral blocs for the next parliamentary elections in 2020. He said he also supported scrapping the voting  bonus  system under which votes of parties that failed to muster enough support to enter parliament would be transferred to the winner of the election. He also supported a switch to a proportional electoral system in 2020.   I will send my justified objection to the parliament today,  Margvelashvili said. The next presidential election in Georgia is to be held in 2018 and it is not clear whether Margvelashvili, who is at odds with the ruling party on several issues, will stand again. MPs from the Georgian Dream said after adopting the new constitution that they would give ground on only two of the president s objections   allowing the parties to form electoral blocs and scrapping the voting bonus system.

President Donald Trump s administration is seeking to implement its regional strategy. While U.S. officials have long been critical of the role Pakistan has played in Afghanistan, senior officials have been more pointed in recent days about Islamabad s alleged support for militant groups. Earlier this week, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the United States would try  one more time  to work with Pakistan in Afghanistan before Trump would  take whatever steps are necessary  to change Pakistan s behavior. On Tuesday, the top U.S. military officer said he believed Pakistan s main spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate, had ties to the militant group.  You want us to sniff them out, we will do that. You want us to take action against them, whatever action you propose, we will do that... (but) these hollow allegations are not acceptable,  Pakistan s Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif told a group of reporters. In August, Trump outlined a new strategy for the war in Afghanistan, chastising Pakistan over its alleged support for Afghan militants. Reuters first reported that possible Trump administration responses being discussed include expanding U.S. drone strikes and perhaps eventually downgrading Pakistan s status as a major non-NATO ally. Asif singled out Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, saying the senator was  playing to his constituents  when he criticized Pakistan.   We are not saying we are saints. Perhaps in the past, we made some mistakes. But since the last three, four years, we are wholeheartedly, single mindedly, we are targeting these terrorists,  Asif said. Asif said that Pakistan had less influence over the Taliban than in previous years, which could impact any efforts for peace talks to bring an end to the war in Afghanistan.

        "text": "MONROVIA (Reuters) - Former soccer star George Weah won the first round of Liberia s presidential election with 38.4 percent of the vote, 10 points ahead of Vice President Joseph Boakai who will face him in a run-off next month, the electoral commission said on Thursday. Liberians are slowly waking up to the prospect of the only African ever to win FIFA World Player of the Year and the Ballon d Or replace Nobel Peace Prize winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as their leader. Weah, 51, has served as a senator from the opposition Congress for Democratic Change since 2015, after returning home from an international soccer career to immerse himself in politics. As a political novice in 2005 he lost to Johnson Sirleaf in a presidential election.  The official final results showed Boakai, representing Johnson Sirleaf s ruling Unity Party, had won 28.8 percent of the vote, putting the two frontrunners comfortably ahead of a large field of mostly minor candidates. Lawyer Charles Brumskine, who says the vote was rigged despite observers calling it fair, came third with 9.6 percent.  King George , as Weah s supporters call him, is wildly popular among the youth and the disenfranchised, especially in the shanties of the rundown seaside capital Monrovia. Many of them feel they have not benefited from Liberia s post-war recovery, a sentiment that has counted against Boakai.  But Weah has so far been light on policy and will face a tough time meeting high expectations in a difficult economic climate of low prices for the commodities that are Liberia s main exports. Johnson Sirleaf, a former finance minister who worked for Citibank and the World Bank during years in exile after fleeing Liberia during a coup, was awarded the 2011 Nobel for shoring up peace after a 15-year civil war that ended in 2003. Many Liberians credit her with creating the conditions that allow this election to bring Liberia s first democratic transfer of power for seven decades. But she has not managed to effectively tackle corruption or lift millions out of poverty. An Ebola outbreak ravaged the economy and a drop in the price of iron ore only made things worse. Poor roads still leave most of rural Liberia stranded during the rainy season, and few Liberians have grid power outside the main cities. ",

        "title": "China warns Taiwan not to rely on foreigners after attack threat",
        "text": "BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan will fail to get foreign support for its cause, the Chinese government said on Wednesday after a Chinese diplomat threatened the self-ruled island with attack, while Taiwan said it was committed to peace. China considers Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is its main source of arms. Beijing regularly calls Taiwan the most sensitive and important issue between it and the United States. In September, the U.S. Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. That prompted a senior U.S.-based Chinese diplomat to say last week that China would attack Taiwan the instant any U.S. navy vessel visited the island. Asked about the remarks at a regular news briefing in Beijing, An Fengshan, spokesman for China s policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwan was an internal matter and China opposed any form of military contacts between Taipei and Washington.  What I want to stress and point out is that any relying on foreigners to build oneself up or plots to harm national sovereignty and territorial integrity will be opposed by the entire Chinese nation, and cannot succeed,  An said. China suspects Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who leads the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, wants to declare the island s formal independence. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. The Chinese air force has this year carried out a series of drills near Taiwan, prompting Taiwan to scramble jets to shadow the mainland aircraft. Speaking at a security forum in Taipei, Taiwan Vice President Chen Chien-jen said China had been sending more naval vessels and aircraft through the East China Sea, in addition to its  provocative behaviors  in the South China Sea, where Taiwan is also party to a festering territorial dispute.  Nevertheless, we remain committed to maintaining the status quo of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, but this requires cooperation from both sides,  Chen said.   We are looking for positive dialogue between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and hope it will happen soon. That would benefit the people on both sides, our region and our world.  Since Tsai took office, China has suspended a regular dialogue mechanism with Taiwan and has been slowly siphoning off its remaining diplomatic allies. ",

        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have an opportunity to mend their countries\u2019 ties when they meet next week, former top U.S. diplomat Henry Kissinger said on Friday, a day after he followed up a meeting with the U.S. president by having talks with Putin. Expectations that Trump\u2019s election would bring a thaw in icy relations between Moscow and Washington have been put on hold, with the White House embroiled in a domestic row over Trump associates\u2019 Russia ties.  The U.S. and Russian leaders are to have their first face-to-face encounter next week at a G20 summit in Hamburg. At a previous moment of heightened tension between Moscow and Washington, in the 1960s, Kissinger acted as a back-channel intermediary, passing messages to the leadership of the Soviet Union on behalf of U.S. President Richard Nixon. The Kremlin on Friday denied that Kissinger, who is visiting Moscow and met Putin behind closed doors on Thursday, was acting as a go-between this time. Speaking at an international affairs conference in Moscow, Kissinger said of the planned Trump-Putin meeting: \u201cI believe that at this moment our two countries have a responsibility, and an opportunity, to make significant progress not just by improving relations, but by improving situations around the world through cooperative efforts.\u201d \u201cTensions between Russia and the United States ... have happened often before and they have been overcome often before,\u201d Kissinger, 94, said. He did not take questions from reporters at the event. Asked if Kissinger was providing a back-channel between the Kremlin and the White House, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u201cHe didn\u2019t try. That did not happen.\u201d He said the Kissinger-Putin meeting was strictly private and declined to disclose what the two men talked about. In May, Trump granted a White House audience to Kissinger. The U.S. leader said he and Kissinger would talk about Russia, among other issues. Speaking at the same Moscow event as Kissinger on Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the significance of the planned Putin-Trump Hamburg meeting was that \u201cthe abnormal period in our relations when the leaders only speak by telephone will be overcome.\u201d \u201cJudging by their telephone conversations, they have a desire to get beyond this abnormality and start seeking agreement on specific issues.\u201d ",

        "title": "Exclusive: Crowded Bangladesh revives plan to settle Rohingya on isolated island",
        "text": "DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh, one of the world s poorest and most crowded nations, plans to go ahead with work to develop an isolated, flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal to temporarily house tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in neighboring Myanmar, officials say. Dhaka says the Rohingya are not welcome, and has told border guards to push back those trying to enter the country illegally. But close to 125,000 Rohingya have crossed into Bangladesh in just 10 days, joining more than 400,000 others already living there in cramped makeshift camps. (For a graphic on Bangladesh's refugee relocation plan click tmsnrt.rs/2k7ZAZy)  We are stopping them wherever we can, but there are areas where we can t stop them because of the nature of the border; forests, hills,  said H.T. Imam, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina s political adviser.  We have requested international agencies for help for shifting the Rohingya temporarily into a place where they can live - an island called Thengar Char. Developing Thengar Char should be given serious consideration,  he said. Leonard Doyle, chief spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration, said the idea of moving refugees to the island has been talked about for years, but he hadn t heard anything new in the past few days. The island, which only emerged from the silt off Bangladesh s delta coast 11 years ago, is two hours by boat from the nearest settlement. It regularly floods during June-September monsoons and, when seas are calm, pirates roam the nearby waters to kidnap fishermen for ransom. Flat and featureless, Thengar Char has no roads or buildings. When Reuters visited in February, a few buffalo grazing along its shores were the only sign of life. (For a graphic on Thengar Char click tmsnrt.rs/2wE9Tcu) The plan to develop the island and use it to house refugees was criticized by humanitarian workers when it was proposed in 2015 and revived last year. Bangladesh, though, insists it alone has the right to decide where to shelter the growing numbers of refugees.  The honorable prime minister wants to resettle them in Thengar Char, though some people say that island will not be a suitable place for them,  said another Hasina aide, who declined to be named.  But there are many such areas in Bangladesh, where Bangladeshis live. It s our country, and we decide.  Officials say no one could have foreseen just how many refugees would arrive so swiftly after violence in northern Myanmar last year sent more than 75,000 Rohingya fleeing across the border. The latest unrest in Myanmar s northwestern Rakhine state began on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base, prompting an army counter-offensive that has killed at least 400 people and forced entire villages to flee. Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists . The country s leader and Nobel laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, has come under international pressure for not speaking out against the persecution of roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya in the Buddhist-majority country. Makeshift camps in Cox s Bazar, in southeast Bangladesh, have grown so rapidly they have run out of space - even for the tiny tarpaulin and bamboo shacks the Rohingya refugees typically throw together.  With hundreds of new refugees streaming in every day, Kutupalong and Nayapara camps are at breaking point,  Duniya Aslam Khan, a spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said in a statement.  Imam, the adviser to Hasina, said a lack of space was the biggest concern right now, adding Bangladesh could not continue to house refugees in its schools and madrassas indefinitely.  We are waiting for Thengar Char to be developed. Once that s done we will shift them,  he told Reuters, reflecting a growing sense of hostility towards the Rohingya even in a Muslim-majority country.  The islands gradually come up because of silting. That s continuing, and that s how Bangladesh has been created. If there are people there, why can t the Rohingya live there?  he said. Some officials in Bangladesh s interior ministry are concerned that settling the refugees on the island would give them a sense of permanent residency, making it harder to send them back to Myanmar. Residents of Sandwip, the nearest island to Thengar Char, say the Rohingya are not welcome. Mizanur Rahman, the administrator of Might Bangha village, the closest settlement to Thengar Char, said local residents who have lost their land to erosion should be relocated first, ahead of the Rohingya. The UNHCR s local office did not respond to an email seeking comment about the relocation plan. Rohingya camped out in Cox s Bazar said they don t want to move to the island, fearing they could die there during the monsoon season and there won t be any work. The violence and refugee exodus have ratcheted up tensions between the two neighbors, and Bangladeshi officials said fighter jets were scrambled last week in response to several Myanmar defense helicopters violating its air space.

        "title": "Republican plan to repeal Obamacare would leave millions uninsured: report",
        "text": " (In March 13 item, corrects paragraph 7 to show uninsured rising) By David Lawder WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fourteen million Americans would lose medical insurance by next year under a Republican plan to dismantle Obamacare that would also reduce the budget deficit, a nonpartisan congressional research office said on Monday, throwing President Donald Trump and Republicans on the defensive as they press forward with replacement legislation. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office forecast that 24 million more people would be uninsured in 2026 if the plan being considered by the House of Representatives to replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act were adopted. Obamacare, as President Barack Obama's signature piece of domestic policy is commonly called, expanded insurance to about 20 million Americans. (bit.ly/2mkdeYA) Hours after the CBO report was released, the House Budget Committee postponed its consideration of the Republican bill to Thursday from Wednesday. Prior to the report, Republicans had been planning to vote soon on the bill in the House, where it is likely to pass, and send it to the Senate, where its outlook is uncertain.  The CBO projected that 52 million people would be uninsured by 2026 if the bill became law, compared with 28 million who would not have coverage that year if the law remained unchanged. Two House of Representatives committees have approved the legislation to dismantle Obamacare that was unveiled by Republican leaders a week ago, but it faces opposition from not only Democrats but also medical providers including doctors and hospitals and many conservatives. The CBO report\u2019s findings could make the Republican plan a harder sell for lawmakers, particularly in the U.S. Senate. The CBO, however, said federal deficits would fall by $337 billion between 2017 and 2026 under the Republican bill. Some health policy experts and Wall Street analysts said the report was more draconian than expected, with the uninsured rate rising more quickly than foreseen. Doctors groups and patient advocates said the bill must be abandoned. The AARP, a nonprofit advocacy group for aging Americans, said Monday that the CBO analysis showed the financial burden of the Republican plan would fall \u201cdisproportionately\u201d on Americans 50 to 64 years old. In a five-page letter to House members last week, the AARP has also criticized a tax cut it said would threaten the solvency of Medicare, the government health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, cuts to Medicaid and said the bill does nothing to lower drug costs. Some Republicans worry a misfire on the Republican healthcare legislation could hobble Trump\u2019s presidency and set the stage for losses for the party in the 2018 congressional elections.  The Trump administration defended the healthcare plan, which they say will have a second and third phase that will entice consumers. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said at the White House that Trump\u2019s plan would cover more individuals at a lower cost and it was \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to envision that 14 million people would lose insurance coverage by next year. Democratic leaders in Congress said the bill could result in elderly people being kicked out of nursing homes as it simultaneously gives tax cuts for the richest Americans. \u201cHow can they look their constituents in the eye when they say 24 million of you no longer have coverage and those of you who do have it, will have less coverage at more cost to you,\u201d House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said. Trump himself made no comment on the report. The Affordable Care Act aimed to help restrain U.S. healthcare spending, which is about 17 percent of the nation\u2019s economy, but it has continued to grow faster than inflation.  The proposal would end the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and would replace Obamacare\u2019s income-based subsidies with fixed tax credits for the purchase of private insurance. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center on Monday said the Republican plan would benefit the wealthiest U.S. households far more than middle-income families. A family making $51,600 to $89,400 a year, including fringe benefits like employer-provided health insurance, would get a tax cut averaging $300. The top 0.1 percent of earners with incomes of at least $3.9 million would get a tax cut of about $207,000, the study said. The CBO estimated that insurance premiums would rise 15 percent to 20 percent in both 2018 and 2019 because fewer healthy people would sign up after the repeal of the Obamacare penalty for declining to obtain insurance. But it said the hikes would be offset after 2020 by a $100 billion fund allocated to states in the bill and deregulation in the insurance market.  By 2026, average premiums for single policyholders in the nongroup market under the legislation would be roughly 10 percent lower than the estimates under current law, in part because insurers will be able to offer plans that cover a lower share of healthcare costs. While the federal government would lose revenues through the repeal of Obamacare\u2019s individual and employer mandates\u2019 tax penalties, CBO said the loss would be surpassed by savings on insurance subsidies and Medicaid payments that Washington would no longer have to provide for people who lost coverage.  At the same time, CBO said the repeal of the individual mandate\u2019s tax penalties would mean higher health insurance premiums for those who retained coverage, because insurers would still have to cover any applicant without being free to raise premiums for older, sicker people, despite lower numbers of younger, healthier customers who are cheaper to insure. Craig Garthwaite, director of the healthcare program at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, said the CBO estimates made it harder for Republicans to sell their proposal.  \u201cOverall, this is a really bad number for the AHCA. Far more people are predicted to lose coverage than many estimated - and these losses are going to happen more quickly than we would have thought,\u201d he said. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a key backer of the plan called the American Health Care Act, said the CBO estimates showed it would ultimately lower premiums.  \u201cOur plan is not about forcing people to buy expensive, one-size-fits-all coverage. It is about giving people more choices and better access to a plan they want and can afford. When people have more choices, costs go down,\u201d Ryan said. Vishnu Lekraj, an equity analyst at Morningstar, said the bill is a net negative for insurers, who would be helped by the elimination of a tax, but hurt by the shrinking individual insurance business. \u201cThe headline number will be viewed as a shock to the system tomorrow,\u201d Brian Tanquilut, a stock analyst at Jefferies said of the 14 million losing insurance next year. \u201cThe reality of this is that the number being big makes it harder for the bill to pass in its current form.\u201d ",

        "text": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro baited U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday by thanking him for a barrage of criticism that had made him famous worldwide.   It s an honor that the head of the empire mentions me every day,  said the 54-year-old president, just back in Venezuela from a trip to Russia, Belarus and Turkey.   That means I m doing something right!  Maduro laughed, during his weekly program on state TV. Saying Venezuela has become a corrupt and repressive dictatorship, the U.S. government has widened individual sanctions on top officials including Maduro and also prohibited new debt dealings with Caracas.  Businessman-turned-president Trump has repeatedly criticized Maduro and his Socialist Party in public and at meetings with other heads of state.  Donald Trump has become the head of the Venezuelan opposition,  said Maduro, who has ruled the OPEC member since 2013 but seen his popularity plummet during an economic crisis.  He has made me famous around the world. Every time he mentions me, they love me more,  Maduro added, saying he had been acclaimed by people abroad on his visit to nations who have all had frayed relations with Washington. Maduro said he had a one-and-half hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin where, among other subjects, he discussed the possibility of trading Venezuelan oil in rubles because of the U.S. financial sanctions.   A whole new world is opening up for Venezuela thanks to Trump s sanctions,  said Maduro, who has also said he hopes to move Venezuela s commercial transactions to euros, yen and rupees. On Oct. 15, Maduro s government faces off with Venezuela s opposition in elections for state governors. Maduro used his TV show to accuse foes of sabotaging public services during the campaign, including cutting electricity cables. Appearing next to him on TV, Vice President Tareck el Aissami said that an opposition-linked activist had been arrested for an explosion that injured seven policemen during anti-Maduro protests earlier this year. Venezuela s opposition says the government routinely frames activists by planting explosive materials, arms and money, and invents links between them and criminals, to justify political repression.

        "title": "Exclusive: Nissan halts joint development of luxury cars with Daimler - sources",
        "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Nissan is halting joint development of luxury cars with Daimler\u2019s Mercedes-Benz, sources close to the companies told Reuters, suspending a key project in their seven-year partnership and potentially hitting profitability at a new shared factory in Mexico. Nissan (7201.T) decided in October its premium Infiniti brand would not use \u201cMFA2\u201d, an upgraded Daimler (DAIGn.DE) car platform that the companies have jointly funded, in part because Infiniti was not performing well enough to absorb Mercedes technology costs, the sources said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t possible to close a deal on the basis of MFA2,\u201d said one of the people. \u201cThe targets set by Infiniti were too difficult to achieve.\u201d The move could reduce efficiency at a $1 billion shared factory opening this year in Aguascalientes, Mexico, where the companies had planned to use the same compact car architecture to cut complexity and production costs, two of the sources said. It could also ultimately force Nissan to write down part of a 250 million pound ($306 million) investment at its UK plant that included Mercedes-based tooling, they added. Daimler and Nissan pursue joint programs only when \u201cbeneficial for both sides\u201d, the companies said in separate statements to Reuters, without directly addressing emailed questions about their plans for MFA2 vehicles. Projects are constantly reviewed against targets to account for \u201cdevelopments beyond the control of management\u201d, they added, and discussions about joint development of future premium compact cars are ongoing.  Nissan\u2019s decision deals a blow to the broad cooperation deal struck between Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn and his Daimler counterpart Dieter Zetsche in 2010. It also underscores the mixed results of Nissan\u2019s battle over almost three decades to transform Infiniti into a significant global player in the lucrative luxury car market. The decision predates Donald Trump\u2019s election as the next U.S. president, the sources said, and was unrelated to campaign vows to penalize Mexican imports that have rattled the auto industry. Ford (F.N) on Tuesday scrapped a planned compact car plant in the country. Nissan and Daimler are pushing ahead with Aguascalientes, where they will build Infiniti and Mercedes models for the U.S. and other markets from a single assembly line opening in 2017. The project nonetheless faces weakening U.S. demand for smaller cars that contributed to Ford\u2019s cancellation and has further raised profitability hurdles for new Infiniti compacts. Persistently low oil prices accelerated the market shift to larger vehicles in 2016, Ford sales chief Mark LaNeve said on Wednesday. \u201cAll the growth was SUVs and trucks.\u201d Infiniti has struggled outside the United States, last year selling 16,000 vehicles in Western Europe and 230,000 globally - less than 5 percent of Nissan\u2019s overall tally and barely one-tenth of Mercedes\u2019s expected 2 million deliveries. The first Infiniti appeared in 1989, the same year as the launch model for Toyota\u2019s (7203.T) upscale Lexus brand - which has since grown three times bigger by sales. Modern carmakers pursue economies of scale by increasing the number of models built on each underlying platform - an adaptable chassis accommodating different body sizes, engines and alternative component sets for every part of the vehicle. The retreat on luxury compacts leaves intact the sharing of engines between Infiniti and Mercedes, and small cars between Renault and Daimler\u2019s Smart. The three groups also collaborate on vans and pickups. But joint premium car development for Mexican production was \u201cone of the largest projects between the Renault-Nissan alliance and Daimler\u201d, Ghosn said when unveiling the program in 2014. A year later, after upgrading its plant in Sunderland, England, Nissan began building the Infiniti Q30 hatchback on the current MFA architecture developed for the Mercedes A-Class and derivatives. The plant added the QX30 SUV in 2016, extending Infiniti\u2019s push into smaller vehicles. Nissan has now ditched plans to use the updated Mercedes platform for successors to those models planned for Aguascalientes, the sources said - or for any future Infinitis. Other cancellations include a compact Mercedes-based Infiniti Q40 sedan earmarked for the plant in 2018. Instead the single, less efficient assembly line will build Mercedes cars including an A-Class sedan and subsequent mini-SUV alongside Infiniti vehicles based on Renault-Nissan architecture, starting with a new QX50 SUV this year. Nissan was forced to conclude that the Infiniti brand would not command the higher prices required to turn a profit on vehicles stuffed with Mercedes technology, one source explained.  \u201cOne of the lessons learned is that if you have the costs of a luxury vehicle but not the pricing, it\u2019s hard to be profitable,\u201d he said. Nissan may end up writing down some Sunderland investment in Mercedes-based tooling that had been intended to outlast the current Q30 and QX30, people with knowledge of the matter said.  The company is still paying its share of MFA2 development costs running to hundreds of millions of euros for a platform it no longer plans to use, they said, but will leave Daimler with a higher share of some production costs in Aguascalientes. The setback may also show the limits of Ghosn\u2019s consensual approach to economies of scale as head of both Renault (RENA.PA) and Nissan, whose 18-year-old alliance is underpinned by significant cross-shareholdings. The slow pace of integration has contributed to upheaval at the recently created alliance powertrain division, charged with  converging Renault and Nissan engineering. Plans to build Infinitis on Mercedes technology had encountered resistance at Nissan from the start, one source said. \u201cOnce again, Ghosn has been unable to break through the wall of engineers to force commonality.\u201d ",

        "title": "Former Equifax chief apologizes to Congress over hack",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The former head of Equifax Inc (EFX.N) apologized repeatedly on Tuesday at a congressional hearing for the theft of millions of people\u2019s personal data in a hacking breach, saying it took weeks for the credit bureau to understand the extent of the intrusion. Richard Smith retired last week but the 57-year-old executive led the company over the time of the hack, which Equifax acknowledged in early September. Late on Monday, Equifax said an independent review had increased the estimate of potentially affected U.S. consumers by 2.5 million to 145.5 million. In March, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security alerted Equifax to an online gap in security but the company did nothing, said Smith. \u201cThe vulnerability remained in an Equifax web application much longer than it should have,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI am here today to apologize to the American people myself.\u201d Equifax keeps a trove of consumer data for banks and other creditors who want to know whether a customer is likely to default. Smith said both technology and human error opened the company\u2019s system to the cyber hack, which has been a calamity for Equifax, costing it about a quarter of its stock market value and leading several top executives to depart. A company employee failed to tell the information team a software vulnerability that hackers could exploit should be fixed, Smith said. Then, a later system scan did not uncover the weak point. Smith said he was notified on July 31 that \u201csuspicious activity had occurred,\u201d after security personnel had already disabled the web application and shut down the hacking. He said he only learned in the middle of August the scope of the stolen data.  On Aug. 2, the company alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and retained a law firm and consulting firm to provide advice. Smith notified the board\u2019s lead director on Aug. 22.

        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China s domestically developed AG600, the world s largest amphibious aircraft, performed its maiden flight on Sunday from an airport on the shores of the South China Sea, the latest step in a military modernization program. China has stepped up research on advanced military equipment as it adopts a more muscular approach to territorial disputes in places such as the disputed South China Sea, rattling nerves in the Asia-Pacific region and the United States. State television showed live images of the AG600 lifting off from Zhuhai airport in the southern province of Guangdong, which sits on the South China Sea coast. It returned about an hour later and taxied to its stand accompanied by martial music and greeted by crowds waving Chinese flags. Xinhua news agency said the aircraft was the  protector spirit of the sea, islands and reefs . It had previously been scheduled to make its first flight earlier this year but it is unclear why it was delayed after ground tests took place in April. State-owned Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC) [SASADY.UL] has spent almost eight years developing the aircraft, which is roughly the size of a Boeing Co (BA.N) 737 and is designed to carry out marine rescues and battle forest fires. However, state media has also noted its potential use in the South China Sea, where China, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Brunei all have overlapping claims. The AG600 s chief designer, Huang Lingcai, was quoted in the official China Daily earlier this month as saying it can make round trips without refueling from the southern island province of Hainan to James Shoal, claimed by China but which is located close to Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo. Powered by four turboprop engines, the AG600 can carry 50 people during maritime search-and-rescue missions, and can scoop up 12 metric tons of water within 20 seconds for fire fighting trips, according to state media. The aircraft has received 17 orders so far from Chinese government departments and Chinese companies. It has a maximum flight range of 4,500 km (2,800 miles) and a maximum take-off weight of 53.5 tonnes. It can use conventional airports and also land and take-off from the sea. China is in the midst of a massive military modernization program, ranging from testing anti-satellite missiles to building stealth fighters and the country s first indigenous aircraft carrier, to add to an existing one bought from Ukraine.

Senior U.S. officials have said President Donald Trump is likely on Wednesday to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital while delaying relocating the embassy from Tel Aviv for another six months, though he is expected to order his aides to begin planning such a move immediately.      The officials said, however, that no final decisions have been made as an outcry grew across the Middle East and among world powers against any unilateral U.S. decision on Jerusalem. Barkat said the United States would only have to convert one of its existing assets in the city, such as its consulate located in West Jerusalem.   They just take the symbol of the consulate and switch it to the embassy symbol - two American Marines can do it in two minutes, and give the ambassador David Friedman a space to sit in,  Barkat told Israel Radio.   The implementation of this decision is immediate and then later slowly start moving the employees in a more structured manner to begin providing services in Jerusalem,  Barkat said.  The status of Jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks in decades of on-and-off Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.  The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Israel considers all of the city its indivisible, eternal capital. Jerusalem is home to sites holy to Islam, Judaism and Christianity Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East War and later annexed it, a move not recognized internationally.  U.S. endorsement of Israel s claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital would break with decades of U.S. policy that the city s status must be decided in negotiations with the Palestinians.  ",

        "text": "BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina s previous government never asked Interpol to drop arrest warrants against a group of Iranians accused of bombing a Jewish center, the ex-head of the police agency said on Wednesday, as the government proceeded with treason charges against the former president. Former Interpol chief Ronald Noble said in an email on Wednesday that he wants to testify that the government of former President Cristina Fernandez did not ask to have the arrest warrants lifted as part of a  memorandum  she had with Iran. If a judge allows Noble to testify, the treason case filed this month against Fernandez and 11 other top officials could crumble. She denies wrongdoing and calls the charge politically motivated. The arrest warrants  were not affected in their validity by the approval of the memorandum,  Noble said in an email to a federal appeals court that was seen by Reuters. The Fernandez administration  always expressed its belief that the warrants should remain in effect,  the email said. The accusation that the Fernandez government worked behind the scenes to clear the accused bombers of the AMIA Jewish community center in order to improve trade between Argentina and Iran is at the heart of a charge of treason brought against Fernandez.  She served as president for eight years before being succeeded by Mauricio Macri in 2015. Others agreed that the treason charge against Fernandez appeared questionable.  The indictment by Judge Claudio Bonadio of former President Fernandez, her Foreign Minister Hector Timerman, and 10 others, for  treason  and  concealment  points to no evidence that would seem to substantiate those charges,  Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Tuesday.  The allegations against Fernandez drew international attention in January 2015, when the prosecutor who initially made them, Alberto Nisman, was found shot dead in the bathroom of his Buenos Aires apartment. An Argentine appeals court ordered the re-opening of the investigation a year ago. Nisman s death was classified a suicide, though an official investigating the case has said the shooting appeared to be a homicide. Nisman s body was discovered hours before he was to brief Congress on the 1994 bombing of the AMIA center.  Nisman said Fernandez worked behind the scenes to clear Iran of any wrongdoing and normalize relations to clinch a grains-for-oil deal with Tehran that was signed in 2013. The  memorandum  agreement created a joint commission to investigate the AMIA bombing that critics said was really a means to absolve Iran. ",

        "title": "Vatican trip could boost Sanders' fight against Clinton",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders will  speak at an event in the Vatican next week, likely broadening his appeal to Catholic voters ahead of crucial nominating contests in a series of Northeastern states. Like Pope Francis, Sanders has made economic inequality and the plight of the working class a central tenet of his message. Sanders\u2019 April 15 visit to Vatican City, where he will give an economic address at a conference, will come just days before Democrats in New York vote in their state primary. The trip may help the U.S. senator amplify the anti-corporate line of attack he has employed against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as he tries to keep his insurgent campaign for the Nov. 8 presidential election alive.  Sanders, who would be the first Jewish U.S. president if elected, described himself on MSNBC as a \u201cbig, big fan of the pope,\u201d who leads the world\u2019s 1.2 billion Catholics. Speaking to reporters in New York later, Sanders said he hoped to meet with Francis.  \u201cThe pope\u2019s schedule is determined by the Vatican but I would certainly be enthusiastic about that,\u201d said Sanders, 74, the Brooklyn-born son of Polish-Jewish immigrants.  A meeting with the Argentine pontiff could provide an electoral boost to Sanders, who has trailed former Secretary of State Clinton in support among America\u2019s Catholic Democrats. \u201cPope Francis has criticized the \u2018make money at all cost\u2019 capitalist mentality and called for more compassion for the poor,\u201d said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist in Washington. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the way, Bernie Sanders wants to define his campaign against Clinton.\u201d         Clinton has scored victories over Sanders in Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Texas, all of which are more than one-quarter Catholic.  A survey by the Pew Research Center earlier this year found that while almost 70 percent of Catholic Democrats thought Clinton would make a good president, just 46 percent thought Sanders would be one. \u201cThis is a great play for Sanders because it ties directly his messaging related to income equality, it puts him on the world stage as a leader, and it does it with an institution and leader important to a key voting bloc in a state where every vote is going to count heading into the primary,\u201d said Virginia-based Democratic strategist Bud Jackson.  Sanders was invited to speak at the Vatican event by the Vatican, a senior papal official said, denying a report that Sanders had invited himself. \u201cI deny that. It was not that way,\u201d Monsignor Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo told Reuters. Sorondo, a close aide to Pope Francis, is chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, which is hosting the event. Late April brings nominating contests in Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island, all states with large populations of Catholic voters. Sanders\u2019 victory earlier this week over Clinton in the Wisconsin primary marked his sixth win in the past seven contests, sparking renewed talk of Clinton\u2019s political vulnerability despite her substantial delegate lead. Sanders this week said Clinton, who is also a former first lady and former U.S. senator, was not qualified to be president. After heavy criticism from Clinton\u2019s campaign and other Democrats, he backed off Friday morning in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday.\u201d  \u201cOn her worst day, she would be an infinitely better president than either of the Republican candidates,\u201d he said, referring to New York developer Donald Trump and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Clinton has been under fire from progressives since her campaign began. On Thursday, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had a testy exchange at a campaign rally in Philadelphia with protestors from the Black Lives Matter movement over the effects of an anti-crime bill passed during his presidency.  At one point, Bill Clinton accused the movement of \u201cdefending the people who kill the lives you say matter.\u201d  On Friday, he seemed regretful. \u201cI rather vigorously defended my wife, as I am wont to do, and I realized, finally, I was talking past her (the protestor) the same way she was talking past me,\u201d Clinton said at an event in Erie, Pennsylvania. \u201cWe have got to stop that in this country. We\u2019ve got to listen to each other again.\u201d   In the Republican race, Trump extended his lead nationally over Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll. The national online poll showed that 42 percent of Republicans support Trump, compared with 32 percent for Cruz and 20 percent for Kasich.           ",

        "title": "Clinton visits North Carolina in campaign trail return; Trump up in polls",
        "text": "GREENSBORO, N.C. (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton got back on the campaign trail on Thursday after taking three days off for pneumonia, and the Democratic presidential candidate faced a more challenging political landscape, with Republican rival Donald Trump rising in opinion polls. Senior Clinton aides said they always expected the race to the Nov. 8 election to be close. But it was clear from a raft of new polls that Trump had halted a summer swoon after taking steps to give a less freewheeling, more polished performance on the stump. Clinton, 68, appeared in good health on a visit to her campaign plane\u2019s press cabin while flying to Greensboro, North Carolina, for a rally where she sought to refocus her campaign on the plight of the working class - which has turned out to be a potent theme for Trump. Leaving the stage to the tune of James Brown\u2019s \u201cI feel good,\u201d Clinton told reporters she kept her pneumonia diagnosis last Friday quiet, telling only senior staff, because she thought she would be able to \u201cpower through\u201d the illness and keep campaigning. \u201cFrom my perspective, I thought I was going to be fine and I thought that there was no reason to make a big fuss about it,\u201d she said. On Sunday, Clinton nearly collapsed while leaving a ceremony marking the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York. Her illness coincided with a mini-surge by Trump, who has drawn even or taken a slight lead in national polls. Polls in battleground states where the race is likely to be decided showed Trump now leading in Iowa, Ohio, Florida and Nevada, and tied in North Carolina. Following her appearance in North Carolina, Clinton was scheduled to appear at a Washington dinner. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, said the candidate and her aides expected the contest to be close. \u201cWe always expected the race to tighten up, we still feel like we\u2019re in a strong position with organizational advantage in Florida and Ohio,\u201d Podesta told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThey call these states battlegrounds for a reason.\u201d In a speech at the New York Economic Club, Trump stuck to his script, avoiding the more improvisational style that has produced a cornucopia of controversies. Trump pushed a package of tax cuts he said would help power the U.S. economy to an annual growth rate of 3.5 percent. The New York businessman said his goal would be 4 percent growth, a target originally championed by Republican primary rival Jeb Bush. Trump said the growth would generate 25 million new jobs. His economic package resurrected a decades-old debate on whether tax cuts can generate sustainable growth. But the overarching impression left by his speech was one of Trump talking about substantive issues and avoiding the frivolous. Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist who managed 2004 candidate John Kerry\u2019s unsuccessful campaign, said Clinton remained the favorite to win the White House, with demographic changes favoring her over Trump, who is heavily reliant on white voters. What has hurt Clinton, Shrum said, is not the time taken off from the campaign trail but rather her decision to keep her diagnosis secret until forced to disclose it - which reinforced a perception among voters that she has a penchant for secrecy. \u201cFairly or unfairly, what this was taken as was more evidence that she was not transparent and that\u2019s what hurts her,\u201d Shrum said. \u201cShe been far more transparent than Trump but she hasn\u2019t gotten any credit for it.\u201d Democrats have sought to pressure Trump to release his tax returns, but the Republican has said he will not release them until a federal government audit has been completed. Clinton has released her tax records. With the candidates\u2019 health in the spotlight, Trump, 70, on Thursday released details of a recent physical examination, a day after Clinton released specifics on her medical condition. Trump\u2019s campaign said the results of his physical showed the fast-food fan has normal cholesterol with the help of a statin drug, weighs 236 pounds (107 kg) and has normal blood pressure. In a not-so-subtle slap at Clinton, the Trump campaign said his medical report showed he \u201chas the stamina to endure \u2014 uninterrupted \u2014 the rigors of a punishing and unprecedented presidential campaign and, more importantly, the singularly demanding job of president of the United States.\u201d Trump also appeared on the \u201cDr. Oz Show\u201d to discuss his health in an interview with host Mehmet Oz, a surgeon. Top Clinton aide Jennifer Palmieri said \u201cone upside\u201d of Clinton\u2019s unplanned break was the chance to \u201csharpen the final argument Clinton will present to voters in these closing weeks.\u201d \u201cOur campaign readily admits that running against a candidate as controversial as Donald Trump means it is harder to be heard on what you aspire for the country\u2019s future, and it is incumbent on us to work harder,\u201d Palmieri said in a statement. Trump backers on Capitol Hill said they were heartened by the tightening race after a call on Thursday morning with his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who mapped out what the campaign was doing. She promised a more policy-driven approach from Trump in the race\u2019s final stretch. \u201cThe poll numbers are just looking phenomenal as you move away from registered voters to likely voters,\u201d Republican U.S. Representative Blake Farenthold of Texas said.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Emails released by the Oklahoma attorney general\u2019s office show a cozy relationship between energy companies and Scott Pruitt, who was the state\u2019s top prosecutor before being sworn in last week as the new chief U.S. environmental regulator, a media watchdog group said on Wednesday. The Center for Media and Democracy has sought the release of emails between energy companies and Pruitt for the past two years, saying they show energy companies drafted language that Pruitt\u2019s attorney general office then used in suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the office he now heads, over regulations on energy operations.   The center had sued Pruitt on Feb. 7, ahead of the Senate vote to confirm his nomination by President Donald Trump, to release the records detailing his communications with energy companies.  The attorney general\u2019s office released more than 7,500 pages of emails late on Tuesday, holding back an unknown number of documents it called exempted or privileged. Oklahoma Judge Aletia Timmons is reviewing those documents, but there is no set time for when or if they would be released. Among the documents released were communications between Devon Energy and Pruitt's office that suggest the company gave the Oklahoma officials language on limits on methane emissions at oil and gas operations. Pruitt's office then used this language in suing the EPA over the regulations, the documents suggest. (bit.ly/2lFEymC)  The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Devon serves as a resource with information and expertise for decision makers, and its contact with Pruitt was consistent with its policy of engaging with policymakers, company spokesman John Porretto said. Nick Surgey, a research director at the Center for Media and Democracy, called the document release a \u201cmajor breakthrough\u201d that revealed a close and friendly relationship between Pruitt\u2019s office and the oil and gas industry, with frequent meetings, calls, and dinners. The center said before the release of the emails that Pruitt\u2019s office had violated Oklahoma\u2019s Open Records Act by delaying their issuance. Critics of Pruitt\u2019s nomination to head the EPA were concerned over his record on the environment - he sued the agency more than a dozen times on behalf of his oil-producing state and has doubted the science of climate change - and Democrats in the Senate held an all night debate last week trying to stop his confirmation vote until the emails were released. He was confirmed on Friday with two Democrats from energy-producing states voting for him.  A spokesman at the Oklahoma attorney general\u2019s office would not say how many documents were sent to the judge for review or how it decided which ones to fully release. The office went \u201cabove and beyond\u201d what is required under the Open Records Act by producing records that would typically be considered ones outside the law\u2019s scope, the office said in a release.

        "title": "Poland gives government key election role, opposition sounds alarm",
        "text": "WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland s parliament has passed a bill that gives the government, rather than a panel of top judges, control over who conducts elections, a move the opposition called  satanic . Minutes before midnight on Thursday, lawmakers of the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party and their allies approved a bill that allows the interior minister to nominate all candidates for head of the National Election Bureau. The PiS has said its bill will make voting more transparent, but critics have said the real aim is to boost the electoral prospects of the party, which has denied European Commission accusations of eroding democratic standards. The head of the judges  panel, the State Electoral Commission (PKW), said the bill would undermine the electoral process.  De facto, the minister will take decisions, not us,  PKW head Wojciech Hermelinski told reporters on Friday. Poland is already at risk of sanctions from the EU over a PiS judicial reform; Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Thursday he expected the European Commission to launch an unprecedented punishment procedure against Warsaw next week.    Hermelinski said Germany had a functioning system where government officials organized elections, but that the Polish government should not leave the independent PKW in place as a  camouflage  without real powers. According to the bill, if none of the minister s candidates meet with the judges  approval, the minister can simply appoint the head of the Election Bureau.   Lawmaker Jacek Protas from the opposition Civic Platform said in parliament that the bill was a  satanic idea  that would give a controlling stake in democracy to a single political party. The PKW head said he would speak to members of the PiS-dominated upper house, the Senate, and President Andrzej Duda to urge them to prevent the measures passing into law. The changes will also require the PKW to appoint about 100 lower-ranking election officials from lists of candidates presented by the interior minister. Those candidates will no longer have to be judges themselves and, as with the head of the bureau, if the PKW rejects all the names put forward, the minister will have the power to impose a choice. The PiS-dominated Senate is set on Thursday to approve the overhaul of the judiciary - the deepest since Poland s transition from communism nearly three decades ago - which the opposition says violates the constitution.

        "title": "Trump picks former U.S. Senator Coats as director of national intelligence",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday picked former U.S. Senator Dan Coats as his director of national intelligence, two senior transition officials said, as he puts his stamp on a U.S. intelligence community that he frequently criticizes. The official announcement was expected this week as Trump makes decisions on some of the remaining major positions he must fill as he prepares to take over the White House on Jan. 20. Coats, 73, is a traditional conservative from Indiana who just finished a six-year term in the U.S. Senate. He was also  U.S. ambassador to Germany for Republican President George W. Bush.  Coats \u201cwould be an excellent choice,\u201d Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, told reporters. \u201cBecause Dan\u2019s got the experience, he\u2019s got the leadership skills having been an ambassador and I think his time on the committee has served him to understand what that role entails.\u201d One Democratic official familiar with Coats\u2019 background and views described him as a \u201cvery reasonable guy.\u201d Another U.S. official familiar with intelligence matters said he was \u201cvery well respected on both sides of the aisle.\u201d A source close to the transition said Trump had also considered New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for the job but that Christie had chosen not to take it. Trump has repeatedly expressed doubts about the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia had a hand in hacking during the presidential campaign. The Democratic official said Coats knew a lot about Europe and Russia and might \u201cbutt heads with Trump over Russia.\u201d The president-elect was to get a briefing about the intelligence community\u2019s findings on the topic from senior U.S. officials on Friday at Trump Tower in New York. Some U.S. intelligence officials on Thursday welcomed Coats\u2019 selection, saying they hoped his appointment was a sign that Trump was seeking to mend fences with the intelligence community after months of enmity over its assessment that Russia tried to influence the 2016 election through hacking. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a domestic political issue, said he hoped that if confirmed by the Senate, Coats could negotiate what he called \u201ca truce\u201d between the intelligence community and Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, retired Army Lieutenant General Mike Flynn, who was fired as Defense Intelligence Agency director by the current director of national intelligence, James Clapper. Coats has been a vigorous defender of government surveillance programs, having voted against congressional reforms to the National Security Agency\u2019s bulk collection of U.S. call records in 2015. While on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Coats also joined other Republican members in 2014 in approving a minority report that defended the CIA\u2019s use of harsh interrogation methods against detainees in secret foreign prisons, saying the program \u201csaved lives and played a vital role in weakening al Qaida.\u201d The conclusion contrasted with the majority report that found the program failed to produce significant intelligence and that the CIA misled the Bush administration, Congress and the American public about the use of so-called Enhanced Interrogation Techniques. The techniques included waterboarding, which simulates drowning and was condemned as torture by President Barack Obama, other senior officials and lawmakers, and human rights experts    Trump was also nearing decisions on two other Cabinet positions, agriculture secretary and secretary of veterans affairs, with announcements expected soon, the source close to the transition said. The leading candidate to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture was former Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue, although one source said Idaho Governor Butch Otter was also in the mix. For Veterans Affairs, Trump met on Tuesday with Leo Mackay Jr., a former deputy secretary for veterans affairs and a senior vice president of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), about the Cabinet post. ",

        "title": "China facing intensified threat of religious infiltration, extremism: official",
        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China is facing heightened threats from foreign infiltration via religion and from the spread of extremism, a top official for religious affairs said on Tuesday, after strict new rules were passed to manage religious practice in the country. President Xi Jinping has emphasized the need to guard against foreign infiltration through religion and to prevent the spread of  extremist  ideology, while also being tolerant of traditional faiths that he sees as a salve to social ills. China s cabinet last week passed updated rules to regulate religion so as to bolster national security, fight extremism and restrict faith practiced outside state approved organizations. The new rules take effect in February. Wang Zuoan, the head of China s religious affairs bureau, said the revision was urgently needed because  the foreign use of religion to infiltrate (China) intensifies by the day and religious extremist thought is spreading in some areas.    Issues with religion on the internet are starting to break out ... and illegal religious gatherings in some places continue despite bans,  he added, writing in the official paper of the ruling Communist Party, the People s Daily. Wang said that freedom of religious faith is protected by the new rules.  At the same time, freedom of religious faith is not equal to religious activities taking place without legal restrictions,  he added. Religion within China needed to be  sinicized , a term officials use to describe the adjusting of religion to fit Chinese culture as interpreted by the Party.  These rules will help maintain the sinicization of religion in our country ... and keep to the correct path of adapting religion to a socialist society,  he said. China s five officially sanctioned religions - Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Christianity - vowed to fight  desinicization  at a forum on the topic held in Beijing last week, according state media. China has seen a revival of religious practice in recent decades after faith was effectively banned during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s.  Official estimates put the number of believers at around 100 million, but scholars argue that the real number could be many times higher, due to many believers being unregistered with authorities. China requires places of worship to be registered with authorities, but many believers shun official settings in preference for private gatherings often known as  underground  churches. (Story corrects to reflect that rules were passed by China s cabinet, not parliament, in third paragraph.) ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. \u201cThis investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,\u201d Graham said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation news program. \u201cAnd we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he\u2019s the right guy at the right time.\u201d  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump\u2019s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller\u2019s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was \u201cgoing to be fair.\u201d    Russia\u2019s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI\u2019s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller\u2019s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  \u201cI want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,\u201d Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. \u201cAs a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,\u201d he said. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - The man accused of tackling U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and breaking his ribs as he was mowing his lawn pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a misdemeanor assault charge, a court official said. Rene Boucher, 59, waived the formal reading of the charge at a hearing in Bowling Green, Kentucky, Warren County Attorney Amy Milliken said by telephone. Boucher, the Republican senator\u2019s neighbor, is charged with fourth-degree assault causing minor injury, for which he faces up to a year in jail if convicted. A pretrial hearing was set for Nov. 30. Paul, 54, told police that Boucher came onto his property in a gated community near Bowling Green and tackled him from behind, the Bowling Green Daily News reported, citing an arrest warrant.  Paul said on Twitter on Wednesday that he suffered six broken ribs and that X-rays showed a pleural effusion, which is a buildup of fluid in the tissues that line the lungs and the chest. The Kentucky State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating last Friday\u2019s incident, Milliken said.  Citing unnamed sources, Fox News reported on Thursday that Paul had been told federal charges were expected in the case. The senator\u2019s office did not immediately reply to a request for comment on that possibility. Matt Baker, Boucher\u2019s attorney, was not immediately available to comment.  Baker told Bowling Green television station WBKO that the incident was related to a property dispute and called the idea that Paul was \u201cblindsided\u201d an unfair characterization. Baker also told the TV station that politics was not a motivating factor in the dispute. Media reports have said Boucher, also a physician like Paul, had a long-running dispute with the senator.  Milliken said Boucher\u2019s $7,500 bond requiring him to keep a distance of at least 1,000 feet (305 m) between himself and Paul remained in effect. Earlier this week, U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Paul would return next week. ",

        "text": "OSLO (Reuters) - The Nobel Peace Prize winner s campaign to ban nuclear weapons will not make the world more peaceful, the U.S. Embassy in Norway said, confirming its top diplomat will not attend next month s award ceremony.  On Wednesday, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) accused the United States, Britain and France of snubbing its disarmament work by planning to send only second-rank diplomats in a coordinated move. ICAN, a little-known organization that was a surprise choice for the prize, has been campaigning for the U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was adopted by 122 nations in July this year. But the treaty is not signed by - and would not apply to - any of the states that already have nuclear arms: the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, as well as India, Pakistan and North Korea.  North Korea said it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile on Wednesday in a  breakthrough  that puts the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. The U.S. Embassy in Oslo said it planned to send its acting deputy chief of mission instead of its acting ambassador to the Dec. 10 ceremony, attended by King Harald and Queen Sonja and the highlight of the diplomatic calendar in Norway.  This year s Nobel Peace Prize to ICAN for its efforts in support of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, comes at a time of increased danger of nuclear proliferation,  the embassy said in the statement to Reuters on Thursday.   This treaty will not make the world more peaceful, will not result in the elimination of a single nuclear weapon, and will not enhance any state s security,  it said.  This treaty ignores the current security challenges that make nuclear deterrence necessary, and risks undermining existing efforts to address global proliferation.  Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Kenneth Braithwaite to the post of ambassador in Oslo, currently held by an acting ambassador.      While Britain and France will do the same as the United States in sending lower-ranking diplomats to the ceremony, the other two permanent members of the U.N. Security Council are taking different approaches.  The Russian embassy said it would send its ambassador to the ceremony.  The ambassador is planning to attend,  said Russian embassy spokeswoman Olga Kiriak. The Chinese embassy said the ambassador was unavailable and that it had no plans to send someone else instead of him.  We cannot be sure about the ambassador s schedule at this time. He is on holiday,  said a press officer at the Chinese embassy, who did not give her name.  ",

        "text": "MIAMI (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters took their frustrations over Donald Trump\u2019s election as the next U.S. president onto the streets on Friday and into Saturday in several cities, including Portland, Oregon, where one protester was shot. The unidentified man was wounded on Portland\u2019s Morrison Bridge at 12:45 a.m. local time as he and dozens of other protesters crossed it during their demonstration, one of several across the country denouncing Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric about immigrants, Muslims and women. In the Portland incident, police said in a statement that a man got out of a vehicle on the bridge where he confronted and then shot a protester, who was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. The suspect is still at large, police added. Earlier in the night, protesters blocked traffic and threw objects at Portland police dressed in riot gear who responded with pepper spray and flash-bang devices. At one point, police pushed protesters back and appeared to take at least one person into custody, according to footage on a local NBC affiliate.  Hundreds of protesters also marched through the streets of Los Angeles, blocking traffic as they waved signs in opposition of Trump and chanted \u201cWe reject the president elect\u201d and \u201cWhose streets? Our Streets\u201d.  Several thousand activists marched through downtown Miami, with a few hundred making their way onto a highway, halting traffic in both directions. In New York, demonstrators again gathered in Washington Square Park and by Trump Tower, where the Republican president-elect lives, on Fifth Avenue. Trump, who initially denounced Americans who protested against his election, saying they had been \u201cincited\u201d by the media, reversed course and praised them on Friday. \u201cLove the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!\u201d Trump said on Twitter. The tweets were further evidence of Trump\u2019s mixed messages since he announced his candidacy 17 months ago. After Democrat Hillary Clinton conceded defeat early on Wednesday, he took a far more conciliatory tone than he had often displayed during his campaign and promised to be a president for all Americans.  Anti-Trump demonstrators have voiced concerns that his presidency, due to start on Jan. 20, would infringe on Americans\u2019 civil and human rights.  They cited his campaign promises to restrict immigration and register Muslims, as well as allegations the former reality-TV star sexually abused women. Protesters in various cities have chanted slogans, including \u201cNo hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!\u201d and carried signs reading \u201cImpeach Trump\u201d. White supremacist groups including the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) have praised Trump\u2019s election, and some civil rights advocacy groups have reported a spike of attacks on minorities following Trump\u2019s victory on Tuesday. Trump has rejected the KKK\u2019s support. Most of the protests across the country, which have also taken place in Washington, D.C., have been largely comprised of young adults and college students. With the country evenly divided, many voters were shocked by the result given that opinion polls failed to predict Trump\u2019s triumph. The Republican Party also managed to maintain its majorities in both houses of Congress in Tuesday\u2019s vote. More anti-Trump demonstrations were planned for the weekend, including in New York and Los Angeles. A group calling itself \u201c#NotMyPresident\u201d has scheduled an anti-Trump rally for Washington on Jan. 20, Inauguration Day, when the New York real-estate developer formally succeeds President Barack Obama. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus acknowledged on Friday the tight race with Clinton, but said anti-Trump protesters have to accept the election results. He pointed to Trump\u2019s call for unity and meetings on Thursday with Obama and Republican leaders as reasons for reassurance. Security barricades now shield some of Trump\u2019s most visible properties, including the newly opened Trump International Hotel near the White House and Trump Tower in New York. Trump\u2019s base of support in the election was the broad middle of the country, with voters in states that had long supported Democrats shifting to him after he promised to renegotiate trade deals with other countries.

In a letter sent to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, the group that includes Amnesty International and UK legal charity Reprieve called for the release of Sayed Nazar Alwadaei, Hajar Mansoor Hasan and Mahmood Marzooq Mansoor. The three are relatives of Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei and his wife Duaa Alwadaei. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei is the director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, a Britain-based group campaigning for political change in Bahrain. The three were arrested in March in Bahrain while Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei was attending the 34th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.  We therefore urge your government to request Bahrain to immediately release Mr and Mrs Alwadaei s relatives ahead of their October 30 trial and drop all charges against them,  said the letter sent on Thursday. It called the case  part of a pattern of abuse and harassment against human rights defenders and their families in Bahrain . The letter said the three detainees are facing up to three years in jail.  Bahrain is punishing his innocent family as retribution for his peaceful activism,  said Maya Foa, director of Reprieve. Bahrain s government officials could not be immediately reached for a comment. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei s family members have been under the spotlight of Bahrain s authorities since he took part in protest against the attendance of the Gulf state s king at a royal horse show in Britain. King Hamad attended the Royal Windsor Horse Show last year, and the state-run Bahrain News Agency BNA published his photographs with Britain s Queen Elizabeth II. Bahrain, which has a Shi ite Muslim majority population and is ruled by a Sunni royal family, has seen unrest since the  Arab Spring  protests across the region in 2011.

Teams from the three countries kicked off a second round of talks in Mexico City on 25 areas of closed-door discussion, with subjects such as digital commerce and small businesses seen as areas where consensus was possible, officials said. The teams did not debate details, according to officials, but one union leader present said that U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had indicated he favored North American content of more than 70 percent in autos built in the NAFTA region. Taking up where they left off in Washington talks two weeks ago, the delegations were showing each other proposed language for reworking the accord, without yet seeking to thrash out mutually acceptable compromises, officials present told Reuters. Trump s multiple attacks on NAFTA in the build-up to the Mexico City round were seen by Mexican and Canadian officials as a ploy to wring concessions, but they have heightened uncertainty over the accord. Away from the diplomatic noise, the Mexico talks are expected to help define the priorities of each nation rather than yield major advances. Nevertheless, Trump s warnings have Mexico preparing for something hard to imagine even a few months ago - life without the agreement that boosted trilateral trade to around $1 trillion annually from $290 billion in 1993. The Sept. 1-5 talks will touch on some thorny topics such as rules governing local content in products made in North America, Mexico s economy ministry said in a statement. Substantial discussion of such areas is unlikely in either this round or the next one, a source familiar with the process said.  We do not expect any major breakthroughs or major developments in this round. We really don t,  one official familiar with the negotiating process said. Mexican officials believe Trump wants to include rules that a certain amount of content must be made in the United States. The head of Unifor, Canada s largest private sector union, Jerry Dias, told reporters he had suggested in a recent meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Ross that the NAFTA content level for autos be raised to 70 percent from the current 62.5 percent. But Ross, he said, had proposed a  more aggressive  level. Hundreds of small farmers and union members including speakers from Canada gathered outside the Mexican Congress on Friday to demand that NAFTA be reworked to truly help workers. Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke by phone on Thursday and stressed they wanted to reach a NAFTA deal by the end of 2017, the White House said. An accord by year end that significantly changes NAFTA is seen as unlikely. The goal is for an agreement before Mexico s 2018 presidential campaign starts in earnest. Officials fear the campaign will politicize talks, with nationalist frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador already recommending a tougher line from Mexico. Nevertheless, one Mexican official noted that Trump s repeated threats put pressure on his negotiators, forcing them to adopt tougher positions  than they would like,  while another official said they were ready to leave the table if needed. Trump said this week he might trigger a 180-day countdown to withdraw from NAFTA while the talks were ongoing to help meet his goals, which include sharply reducing a $64 billion annual U.S. trade deficit with Mexico. NAFTA, first implemented in 1994, eliminates most tariffs on trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico.  Critics say it has drawn jobs from the United States and Canada to Mexico, where workers are paid far lower wages. Supporters say it has created U.S. jobs, and that the loss of manufacturing from the United States has more to do with China than Mexico. If NAFTA collapses, costs could rise for hundreds of billions of dollars of trade as tariffs are brought back. Free-trade lobby groups say consumers would be saddled with higher prices and less availability of products ranging from avocados and berries to heavy trucks.    Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo and Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray told officials in Washington on Wednesday that Mexico would walk away from the negotiations if Trump pulls the trigger on withdrawing from the deal.  Juan Pablo Castanon, president of Mexico s Business Coordination Council representing the private sector in the talks, said the country was refining a  Plan B  that could be up and running within three months of an eventual NAFTA collapse. Talking on Mexican television, he said the plan included striking new trade arrangements in Asia and Latin America, sourcing alternate suppliers such as Brazil for grains now imported from the United States, and finding ways to recreate investor guarantees that are included in NAFTA.

        "title": "Greek centrists elect alliance leader to boost popularity",
        "text": "ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek centrists elected politician Fofi Gennimata on Sunday to lead a center-left party alliance, hoping to win back voters disillusioned after seven years of crisis and boost their popularity as the country emerges from bailouts. Past attempts by centrists to form parties and alliances have not fared well and the latest bid is seen as a last-ditch effort to restore unity and attract voters, many of whom defected to the ruling leftist Syriza party over the years of painful bailout reforms. The new alliance includes Greece s once-powerful Socialist PASOK party, which Gennimata already leads, the Democratic Socialist Movement, the Democratic Left and the To Potami party. Gennimata won about 58 percent of the vote.  PASOK ruled Greece for decades but has seen its popularity sliding to single-digit figures since 2010, when it signed up to Greece s first bailout from the EU and the International Monetary Fund in return for draconian austerity. It has 19 seats in the 300-member parliament. The centre-left Potami, which was founded in 2014 and first entered parliament with 6.1 percent in a 2015 national election  now ranks eighth in opinion polls with 1.5 percent. It has six MPs. Greece s leftist-led Syriza government was catapulted to power in January 2015 promising to end austerity. It was forced to sign up to a new rescue package, the country s third bailout a few months later. That bailout expires in August.  Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras  term ends in 2019 and he says he will seek a new four-year mandate then. But his ratings have been sagging in opinion polls behind the main opposition, the conservative New Democracy party.     ",

        "title": "Chicago teachers union eyes future security with charter merger",
        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - After trying for years to stymie the growth of charter schools in Chicago, leaders of its public school teachers\u2019 union are seeking to enlist staff from charter schools in a bid to strengthen the union\u2019s bargaining power and tap a new source of members\u2019 fees. Union officials in the third-largest U.S. city say their push for a tie-up took on added urgency after U.S. President Donald Trump chose Betsy DeVos, a backer of charter and private schools, as his education secretary. In cities and suburbs across the country, charters and traditional public schools have been in fierce competition for students and financing. But many are united in their rejection of private schools and voucher programs. Unions fear Trump and DeVos will slash funding for traditional public schools, and the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) wants charter members to boost their ranks in order to help them fight back. A more unified approach has long been the answer, said Jesse Sharkey, vice president of the CTU.  \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get to keep public education the way we currently think of it unless people organize and prepare to defend it,\u201d he said. Charter schools are free and open to the public but are run independently of local school districts by private companies that compete for state funds. They often boast small class sizes, innovative teaching styles or a particular academic focus. Their numbers in the United States have shot up to more than 6,000, from 2,500 a decade ago. An estimated 6 percent of U.S. public school students, or more than 3 million pupils, attend charter schools. The possibility of a merger has many eyes on Chicago, where the proportion of charter school teachers who are unionized on their own is much higher than in other cities. While only about 10 percent of U.S. charter schools had collective bargaining agreements last year, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, 25 percent of Chicago\u2019s 130 charter schools are organized. Leaders of the city\u2019s unionized charter school educators say they see the benefits in joining forces with the CTU. \u201cWe face an existential crisis,\u201d said Chris Baehrend, president of Chicago\u2019s union for charter teachers. \u201cThe answer to every crisis is more solidarity. It\u2019s better for us to be a small part of a larger voice that wins things.\u201d Leaders of his 1,000-member organization had been mulling a merger with the CTU for years, Baehrend said, but Trump\u2019s election propelled them into action from fear of his and DeVos\u2019 conservative agenda. DeVos\u2019 office did not respond to requests for comment.  In June, the education secretary faced hostile questions from a U.S. Senate committee about her support for school vouchers, to which DeVos responded that she was only exploring the possibility of a program.  Vouchers are state-funded payments families can use to send children to private schools.  Supporters say they could give those children in neighborhoods with weak public schools the chance of a better education at private institutions. Critics say they are intended to boost private-sector profits with public money. A majority of Baehrend\u2019s organization voted in June to merge with the CTU.  The CTU\u2019s leadership favors the merger, and its 23,500 members will vote on it in the fall. Baehrend said he is confident the measure will pass.  Not everyone supports the closer links. Some supporters of charter schools say the attributes that attract many parents, including their flexibility and autonomy, could be put at risk in Chicago if the CTU introduces new terms for contracts, such as limits on the time an instructor can teach each day.  \u201cThey\u2019re now trying to find ways to undermine the existing schools via organizing,\u201d Andrew Broy, president of the Illinois Network of Charter Schools, said of the CTU\u2019s leaders.

        "title": "Russia risks decades of low growth under U.S. sanctions: Putin adviser",
        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia risks being saddled with U.S. sanctions for decades, curbing economic growth and preventing it from regaining its status as a leading economic power, an adviser to President Vladimir Putin said in an interview. Alexei Kudrin told Reuters that the current proposed tightening of sanctions in Washington should not have any serious impact. But he called for a major structural reform program after the 2018 presidential election. He said that was the only way for Russia to return to growth of more than 2 percent a year. Putin has not yet said whether he will run for re-election next year, but is widely expected to do so and to win what would be a fourth term as president. Putin has tasked Kudrin, who has known Putin since they worked together in the St Petersburg Mayor\u2019s Office in the 1990s, with devising a strategy to lift Russian economic growth after 2018. Whereas Putin oversaw several years of growth in excess of 5 percent in his early presidential terms, the Russian economy suffered two years of contraction in 2015 and 2016 and is forecast to grow by a little over 1 percent this year. In May GDP rose by 3.1 percent year on year, but that pace is not expected to last. The slowdown has put Putin under pressure. U.S. lawmakers earlier this week voted to impose new sanctions on Russia \u2014 on top of earlier penalties over its role in the Ukraine conflict \u2014 and Kudrin said the mood in Washington meant it would be difficult for U.S. President Donald Trump to ease sanctions in future. \u201cIn its current form the tightening of sanctions under discussion wouldn\u2019t seriously affect the Russian economy, there aren\u2019t serious changes with the version that exists. But the hope that sanctions would be canceled in the coming years has now faded,\u201d Kudrin said. \u201cWe are likely to end up with the story with the old Jackson-Vanik amendment \u2014 even when all the conditions had already changed, they couldn\u2019t cancel it,\u201d he said. Jackson-Vanik, a 1974 provision to a U.S. federal law that punished former Communist bloc countries for restricting human rights, was only repealed in 2012 under previous U.S. President Barack Obama. It was a major sticking point in relations between Moscow and Washington. Trump was widely perceived to be the Kremlin\u2019s favored candidate in last year\u2019s U.S. presidential race, and his White House victory raised hopes in Moscow that sanctions could be relaxed as early as this year. But Trump\u2019s administration has since become bogged down in investigations into possible ties between his campaign and Russia. Trump has said his campaign did not collude with Russia, which flatly denies allegations it meddled in the U.S. vote. Kudrin, who served as finance minister from 2000 to 2011, won praise from foreign investors for building up Russia\u2019s formidable fiscal buffers during an era of high oil prices. He  was one of relatively few liberal voices among top officials. He now heads the Centre for Strategic Research, an analytical group founded on Putin\u2019s initiative to draft policy ideas. Kudrin said Western sanctions in their current configuration were knocking off around 0.5 percent from Russian gross domestic product, down from 1 percent in the year after they were introduced in 2014. Russia had a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d after the 2018 election in which to enact meaningful reforms to counteract the effects of sanctions, he said. But for now a populist camp around Putin appeared to have the upper hand over those calling for reform. \u201cTo what extent the president will use that [window], we don\u2019t know,\u201d Kudrin said. \u201cAfter previous elections that window for reforms wasn\u2019t used.\u201d Among the reforms Kudrin is calling for are greater public control over law enforcement officials, raising the retirement age, reducing government stakes in large companies, and improving revenue collection from the shadow economy. He said he thought the state should sell government stakes in Russian oil companies in stages over the next six to 10 years, and that it could sell a portion of its majority holding in the country\u2019s largest bank Sberbank in the same time period. With such reforms, Kudrin said Russia could increase its economic growth rate to 3-4 percent in five to six years, even with sanctions staying in place. Without reforms, Russia will not notice the damage from sanctions before it is too late, he said. \u201cIn the next six to seven years we could not notice the decline in the areas of productivity and technological development. In the end we will see it, because others will grow faster, but by then it will be difficult to change something.\u201d ",

        "text": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Former Brazilian President Luiz In cio Lula da Silva extended his lead in the run-up to the 2018 presidential election despite a corruption conviction that could bar him from running, a poll showed on Saturday. The Datafolha survey published in the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper showed Lula winning at least 35 percent support from those polled in a first-round vote, up from about 30 percent in a June poll. Two potential competitors, former environment minister Marina Silva and right-wing congressman Jair Bolsonaro, trailed with 13 percent to 17 percent of voting intentions. Lula would beat all potential contenders in a runoff vote, the poll said, expect in an unlikely contest against Sergio Moro, the judge who convicted him of corruption in July. Moro has repeatedly denied being a candidate. Millions of Brazilians were lifted from poverty during Lula s 2003-2010 presidency. Many detractors blame him for a political graft that flourished under the Workers  Party, calling his bribery conviction the end to his political career. Lula may not be eligible to run if his conviction is upheld by a higher court. Datafolha showed 26 percent of voters would vote for a candidate endorsed by Lula in such a scenario.  Sao Paulo state governor Geraldo Alckmin and Sao Paulo city mayor Joao Doria, both from the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), had 8 percent of voting intentions each. Lula was found guilty last month and sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison for accepting 3.7 million reais worth of bribes from engineering firm OAS, the amount of money prosecutors said the company spent refurbishing a beach apartment for Lula in return for his help winning contracts with state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro.

        "title": "China says war must not be allowed on Korean peninsula",
        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - The crisis over North Korea s weapons programs must be resolved through talks, not war, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Thursday, while U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of the danger of  sleepwalking  into conflict. Xi made his comments to visiting South Korean President Moon Jae-in after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered on Tuesday to begin direct talks with North Korea without pre-conditions. But the White House said on Wednesday that no negotiations could be held until North Korea improved its behaviour.  Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tillerson s offer of direct contacts with North Korea was  a very good signal  while warning that any U.S. strike on the country would have catastrophic consequences. Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed North Korea during a phone call, the White House and Kremlin said in separate statements. The two leaders talked about  working together to resolve the very dangerous situation,  the White House said on Thursday. Tillerson is to attend a U.N. Security Council ministerial meeting on North Korea in New York on Friday at which he plans to urge countries to maintain a U.S.-led campaign to pressure Pyongyang to abandon its weapons programs through sanctions. North Korea tested its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile on Nov. 29, which it said could put all of the United States within range, in defiance of international pressure and U.N. sanctions. The United States has said all options were on the table in dealing with North Korea, including military action.  Meeting in Beijing s Great Hall of the People, Xi told Moon the goal of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula must be stuck to, and war and chaos cannot be allowed, Chinese state media said.  The peninsula issue must, in the end, be resolved via dialogue and consultation,  Xi was cited as saying. China and South Korea have an important shared interest in maintaining peace, and China was willing to work with South Korea to promote talks and support North and South to improve relations, Xi said. South Korea s Yonhap news agency said Xi and Moon agreed war on the peninsula would not be tolerated and they would cooperate in applying sanctions and pressure on North Korea. The apparently warm tone of their talks followed nearly a year of tense relations between the two countries. China has been furious about the deployment of the U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea, saying its powerful radar can see far into China. China and South Korea agreed in October to normalise exchanges and move past the dispute, which froze trade and business exchanges. Xi reiterated China s position on THAAD and said he hoped South Korea would continue to  appropriately handle  the issue. Guterres, speaking to reporters in Tokyo after meeting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said Security Council resolutions on North Korea s nuclear and missile programmes must be fully implemented by Pyongyang and other countries. He said he expected Friday s Security Council meeting would deliver a strong expression of unity and the need for diplomacy to resolve the issue.  The worst possible thing that could happen is for us all to sleepwalk into a war,  he said. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said after meeting Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono in London on Thursday that military options in North Korea did not look attractive and the best way forward was to intensify economic pressure. Both China and Russia have welcomed Tillerson s apparent overture. Putin said a U.S. strike on North Korea would have catastrophic consequences and that he hoped to work with Washington eventually to resolve the crisis. Putin told a news conference that Russia did not accept North Korea s nuclear status, but some U.S. actions had provoked North Korea.  We believe the two sides should now stop aggravating the situation,  he said. North Korea justifies its weapons programmes as necessary defence against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention. North Korea s state news agency KCNA said Trump was taking a big step towards nuclear war in seeking a naval blockade and   North Korea would take  merciless self-defence  measures if the United States tried to impose one. North Korea would regard a naval blockade as  an act of war  and a  wanton violation  of its sovereignty and dignity, the agency cited a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying, while reiterating that North Korea was a responsible nuclear power that would fulfil its non proliferation commitments. It was not immediately clear if the latter remark was a response to Tillerson s statement this week that Washington could not accept Pyongyang as a nuclear power as it was a proliferation risk. Washington has not publicly called for a blockade of North Korea, but has sought tougher U.N. steps, including non-consensual inspections of shipping to North Korea.  Stepped-up U.N. Security Council sanctions imposed in September after North Korea s sixth nuclear test called on states to inspect vessels on the high seas, with the consent of the flag state, if they had reasonable grounds to believe the ships were carrying prohibited cargo.  A tougher U.S.-drafted resolution was watered down to win the support of Russia and China. ",

        "text": "DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar s ruler has introduced a law giving broad protection to  tens of thousands of foreigners working as maids, cooks, cleaners and nannies, addressing some concerns long highlighted by human rights groups. The new rules on foreign domestic staff mandate a maximum of 10 hours per working day with breaks for prayer, rest and eating, along with three weeks of severance pay at the end of their contracts. They limit the working age to between 18 and 60, stipulate three weeks of annual vacation, and order that employers provide proper food and medical care. Like other wealthy Gulf Arab states, Qatar hosts tens of thousands of mostly female domestic workers, mostly from the Philippines, South Asia and East Africa. The measures appear to be the first in the gas-producing  country to codify the rights of these employees. State news agency QNA said the measure was promulgated by Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and was effective immediately. Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International have long complained that Gulf states do not properly regulate working conditions for low-income residents helping tend homes or toiling at ubiquitous construction sites. They say excessively long hours and insufficient flexibility to change contracts or return home contravene international labour laws and deprive workers of their human rights. HRW said in the Qatar section of its 2016 annual report that beyond exploitative working conditions, domestic workers were  left vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse by a lack of regulations governing their rights. The new law does not cover Qatar s far more numerous  construction workers, whose position was improved by a December 2016 law altering the  kafala  or sponsorship system that forced them to seek their employer s consent to change jobs or leave the country. Domestic workers continue to be recruited under the kafala system.    Qatar is keen to show it is tackling allegations of worker exploitation as it prepares to host the 2022 soccer World Cup, which it has presented as a showcase of its progress and development. It is spending billions of dollars on stadiums and other infrastructure, and has imported hundreds of thousands of construction workers from countries such as India, Nepal and Bangladesh. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has asked Qatar to present it with a report on the implementation of reforms to the sponsorship system by November. ",

Improve the ACA, DON\u2019T repeal it,\u201d Ryan Murphy, who shared photos of a rally at Yale University, said on Twitter.  Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s first executive order, signed hours after taking office, directed the federal government to scale back regulations, taxes and penalties under the ACA. Republican Representative Tom Price, Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has said an overhaul of Obamacare will initially focus on individual health plans sold through online exchanges and the Medicaid health insurance program for low-income Americans.  Trump has said he wants to keep some elements of the program, such as allowing young adults to be covered under their parents\u2019 insurance. He favors plans that use health savings accounts and sale of insurance across state lines. More than 8.8 million Americans were signed up for 2017 coverage under the ACA through HealthCare.gov as of Jan. 14, according to the site, up from around 8.7 million sign-ups as of Jan. 14 last year.    Arturo Salow, a second year student at Northwestern from Miami, Florida, urged people to sign up for ACA coverage before Tuesday\u2019s deadline, saying more enrollees would make a rollback more challenging for Republicans.  \u201cI\u2019d advise any patient to sign up immediately,\u201d Salow said. \u201cIf they are going to take away coverage, let\u2019s make it as difficult as possible.\u201d ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A detailed version of President Donald Trump\u2019s budget to be released in May will lay out plans to eventually erase U.S. deficits, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re getting into that now.

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British ministers rallied around Boris Johnson on Sunday, saying the foreign secretary was doing a  great job  and had no reason to resign over remarks that critics say may prompt Iran to extend the prison sentence of a jailed aid worker. The coordinated defense is part of attempts to shore up the government of Prime Minister Theresa May, weakened by a series of scandals and gaffes involving her top team of ministers as she negotiates Britain s departure from the European Union. The leader of Britain s main opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, called on May to sack Johnson, writing in the Observer newspaper on Sunday that  we ve put up with him embarrassing and undermining our country through his incompetence ... for long enough. It s time for Boris Johnson to go . Corbyn, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan, also a Labour member, said Johnson had offended states and religions before  bungling  the case of Iranian-British aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, in prison after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran s clerical establishment. She denies the charges. But two of his allies, Brexit minister David Davis and environment minister Michael Gove, defended Johnson, who last week said he could have been clearer in his remark that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in April 2016. Zaghari-Ratcliffe s employer, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity organization, said Johnson s comment made on Nov. 1 was incorrect, while opposition British lawmakers said the remarks could land the aid worker a longer term in jail. The Thomson Reuters Foundation is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News.  Why would you want to sack him? He s a good foreign secretary,  Davis told Sky News.  Gove urged critics to stop focusing on Johnson s role in the case and instead to question the motivation of what he called  the Iranian regime  in jailing Zaghari-Ratcliffe.  There is no reason, no excuse and no justification for her detention and she should be released,  he told the BBC s Andrew Marr show. A Foreign Office source later said Johnson had held a  very constructive  phone call with her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, who has called on the minister to visit his wife in jail. The show of support for Johnson from fellow Brexit campaigners demonstrates the difficulties May faces in keeping her cabinet unified on a range of issues. She lost two of her ministers in a week: Michael Fallon quit as defense minister in a growing sexual harassment scandal and then Priti Patel was forced out of her job as aid minister over undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials.  Forty members of the Conservative Party have agreed to sign a letter of no-confidence in the prime ministers, eight short of the number needed to trigger a leadership contest, the Sunday Times newspaper reported.

Trump, who has praised Putin as \u201cvery smart\u201d, has signaled he wants to improve strained ties with Russia, despite U.S. intelligence agencies alleging the Kremlin chief ordered a cyber campaign to discredit rival Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race.  Russia denies it tried to sway the U.S. election by hacking or other means and Trump has played down the allegations. Last week, he also dismissed accusations that Moscow had collected compromising information about him as \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cphone stuff\u201d. In an interview published on Monday, Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council, struck a cautiously positive tone on the prospects for collaboration with Washington after a period of icy relations under Barack Obama. \u201cIf Donald Trump\u2019s administration is interested we will be ready to resume full-format consultations with our American partners through the Russian Federation\u2019s Security Council,\u201d Patrushev told the government-controlled daily Rossiiskaya Gazeta. However, Patrushev added that he did not expect rapid improvements or a swift lifting of sanctions he said the West had deliberately imposed to \u201chold Russia back\u201d because the two sides were starting from such a low base. Patrushev made his comments before Trump told Britain\u2019s Sunday Times in a weekend interview that he would propose offering to end sanctions imposed on Russia over its annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region in return for a nuclear arms reduction deal with Moscow. On Monday the Kremlin said it would wait until Trump takes office on Friday before commenting on any proposals.  Any agreements to resume cooperation would have to be guided by the principles of mutual respect and equality, said Patrushev. Putin himself chairs Russia\u2019s Security Council. Trump has said Russia can be an important ally against militant Islamist groups such as Islamic State.  Patrushev said he believed the Obama administration had deliberately tried to discredit Russia because it was unwilling to accept that Washington\u2019s position of global leadership was slipping. Obama has been strongly critical of Russian policy in Ukraine and in Syria.  In excerpts from Patrushev\u2019s interview released on Sunday, he told Rossiiskaya Gazeta that Russia was facing increased cyber attacks from abroad - turning against Western countries their own charges of Russian meddling in their affairs.

The four were convicted of hurling stones at the embassy during protests over perceived U.S. support for Kosovan independence. They were not charged over a fire that broke out at the peak of the riots and destroyed part of the building. Washington has pressed for prosecutions for almost a decade, but no one has so far been convicted over the blaze which killed one protester.     The four - Dejan Vucckovic, Dragan Marinkov, Marko Novitovic and Milan Tomas - pleaded not guilty but were convicted of endangering public safety and given two-year suspended sentences.  The court ruling said the men s rocks broke windows in the embassy and other protesters later threw in flares that started the fire. Another three defendants were acquitted due to lack of evidence. Serbia s government and the protesters reacted with fury after Kosovo s declaration of independence on Feb 21, 2008. Serbia considers Kosovo its historic heartland and has waged a diplomatic campaign against the secession of the predominantly ethnic Albanian region. Belgrade lost control of Kosovo in 1999 after NATO bombing ended Serbia s brutal counterinsurgency against Albanians there. Defense lawyer Zelimir Cabrilo said the court s verdict had not addressed the political factors behind the riot.  It was a political decision to stage the rally ... to remove (police) security from the embassy,  Cabrilo told reporters.    Instead, we have light, modest sentences against four persons ... for hurling stones, they were not sentenced for torching it (the embassy).  The case was delayed last year when the Serbian Court of Appeals annulled a lower court s sentencing, citing deficiencies in the ruling, and ordered a retrial. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - A group including former White House ethics attorneys will file a lawsuit on Monday accusing President Donald Trump of allowing his businesses to accept payments from foreign governments, in violation of the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuit, brought by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, will allege that the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause forbids payments to Trump\u2019s businesses. It will seek a court order forbidding Trump from accepting such payments, said Deepak Gupta, one of the lawyers working on the case. Trump does business with countries like China, India, Indonesia and the Philippines, the group noted in a statement. \u201cWhen Trump the president sits down to negotiate trade deals with these countries, the American people will have no way of knowing whether he will also be thinking about the profits of Trump the businessman,\u201d it said. Trump told reporters on Monday the lawsuit was \u201cwithout merit,\u201d when asked about the case after signing some executive orders in the Oval Office.  The White House referred questions to a law firm representing the president on ethics matters.  \u201cWe do not comment on our clients or the work we do for them,\u201d said the representative of the firm, Morgan Lewis & Bockius. The case is part of a wave of litigation expected to be filed against Trump by liberal advocacy groups. It will be filed in federal court in Manhattan, Gupta said, and attorneys for the plaintiffs will include Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer in Republican President George W. Bush\u2019s White House. The impending lawsuit was earlier reported by The New York Times.  Eric Trump, one of Trump\u2019s sons and an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told the Times on Sunday that the company had taken more steps than required by law to avoid any possible legal exposure, such as agreeing to donate any profits collected at Trump-owned hotels that come from foreign government guests to the U.S. Treasury. \u201cThis is purely harassment for political gain,\u201d Trump told the newspaper. The Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause states: \u201cNo Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\u201d ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York\u2019s attorney general ordered Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s charitable foundation to immediately stop fundraising in the state, warning that a failure to do so would be a \u201ccontinuing fraud.\u201d For Trump, the cease-and-desist order was the latest in a series of blows that has sent his campaign reeling. The New York businessman and his aides spent much of the weekend dealing with the fallout from a New York Times report that said Trump may have avoided paying federal income taxes for almost 20 years. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\u2019s office said the Donald J. Trump Foundation was violating a state law requiring charitable organizations that solicit outside donations to register with the office\u2019s Charities Bureau. The order followed a series of reports in The Washington Post that suggested improprieties by the foundation, including using its funds to settle legal disputes involving Trump businesses. \u201cThe failure immediately to discontinue solicitation and to file information and reports required under Article 7-A with the Charities Bureau shall be deemed to be a continuing fraud upon the people of the state of New York,\u201d according to a letter dated on Friday that the office posted online on Monday. Trump\u2019s campaign has suggested that the probe launched by Schneiderman, a Democrat, was politically motivated. While again putting Trump\u2019s campaign on the defensive, the order could also undercut his efforts to make the Clinton Foundation, the family charity of Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton, a primary target in his campaign against her for the Nov. 8 election. Trump has sought to paint the Clinton Foundation as a \u201cpay-to-play\u201d operation under which the former U.S. secretary of state and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, rewarded big donors to the foundation with access. The Clinton Foundation, which has $354 million in assets and almost 500 staffers, is a radically different charitable vehicle from the small-scale Trump nonprofit. It has worked to reduce the cost of drugs for people with HIV in developing countries, eradicate childhood obesity in the United States and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There has been no evidence that foreign donors to the foundation obtained favors from the State Department while Clinton headed the agency. While some donors were able to obtain meetings with her or senior State Department officials, Clinton has said the fact that they had donated to the foundation did not play a role in her decision to meet with them. The scrutiny of the Trump Foundation came as the Republican candidate was dealing with a torrent of bad news, including his shaky performance in his first debate with Clinton on Sept. 26 and the release by the New York Times of tax records that showed Trump taking an almost $1 billion loss in 1995 that may have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years. In its series on the Trump Foundation, The Washington Post reported that Trump may have violated U.S. Internal Revenue Service rules against \u201cself-dealing\u201d by using foundation money to purchase two portraits of himself, which were then hung at his private golf clubs in New York and Florida. The newspaper also said that Trump may have improperly used the foundation to settle legal disputes, including one at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate, diverted income from his business to the charity to avoid paying income tax, and donated foundation money to support Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Republican, who was considering launching an investigation into Trump University, Trump\u2019s for-profit education venture. The foundation ended up paying a $2,500 fine to the IRS for that donation. A Trump Organization representative told the Post the donation was meant to be from Trump\u2019s personal account, and that it came from his foundation\u2019s account by clerical error. In response to the Post\u2019s reporting, Schneiderman\u2019s office began a probe into the Trump Foundation. The Trump campaign said in a statement on Monday that the charity would cooperate with the investigation. \u201cWhile we remain very concerned about the political motives behind AG Schneiderman\u2019s investigation, the Trump Foundation nevertheless intends to cooperate fully with the investigation,\u201d said Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks. \u201cBecause this is an ongoing legal matter, the Trump Foundation will not comment further at this time,\u201d she added. The New York Attorney General\u2019s Office is the sole regulator of charities in the state. A spokesman for the office said it was not unusual for the regulator to send notices to charities whose filings were overdue or incomplete but that a cease-and-desist letter was more serious. While letters such as the one the Trump Foundation, which is based in Woodbury, New York, on Long Island, received are not judgments of wrongdoing, they are sent only after the office gets \u201ca clear indication of wrongdoing,\u201d the spokesman said. Trump established the charitable foundation in 1988, but it runs no programs of its own. Instead, it donates money to other nonprofit groups such as the Police Athletic League for youths. Once the foundation began soliciting money from other donors beyond the Trump family, it was required by New York law to register with the state and file regular reports. ",

        "title": "British lawmakers debate banning Trump after Muslim comments",
        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers on Monday debated a petition to ban U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump from Britain over remarks on Muslims, but while describing his comments as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d, most said the ban would go against free speech. Members of parliament said Trump should be allowed into Britain where his views could be challenged, that a ban would give him more publicity or that it was not for Britain to get involved in U.S. affairs. Trump caused outrage last month with his comments that Muslims should be banned from entering the United States. He spoke after 14 people died in a shooting spree in California by two Muslims whom the FBI said had been radicalized. His comments prompted more than half a million Britons to sign a petition calling for him to be barred from entering the country, where he has business interests. The three-hour debate saw lawmakers from all sides criticize Trump\u2019s comments. While it was not followed by a vote, many more lawmakers spoke against a ban than for it. \u201cI want to see Donald Trump come to this country ... I want him to get a sense of the fury and the frustration with his xenophobic remarks,\u201d said Gavin Robinson, a lawmaker from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party. Only interior minister Theresa May can issue an order banning entry into Britain and Prime Minister David Cameron has said while Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cdivisive, unhelpful and wrong\u201d, he does not back the idea of barring him. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said the government did not comment on who it was considering for exclusion but said \u201ca frank and open exchange of views\u201d was the most effective way to influence Trump. \u201cThe U.S. remains our most important bilateral partner. It is in the UK\u2019s interests that we engage all presidential candidates, Democratic and Republican, even though we may disagree profoundly on important issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is for the American people to hold him to account. It is bad politics ... to intervene in the electoral processes of other countries,\u201d said Conservative lawmaker Tom Tugendhat. Some spoke passionately in favor of banning Trump however, saying he should not be treated differently from others who have been banned for similar views. \u201cJust think what would happen in the current climate if he came ... and preached that message of divisive hate,\u201d said Jack Dromey, an opposition Labour Party spokesman on home affairs.  \u201cTo have someone come to our shores who demonizes all of the Muslim community would be fundamentally wrong and would undermine the safety and security of our citizens and that is not a risk I am prepared to take ... I don\u2019t think Donald Trump should be allowed within a 1,000 miles of our shore.\u201d Trump has threatened to cancel over 700 million pounds ($1 billion) of planned investments in golf courses in Scotland if he is banned. Trump International Golf Links in Scotland said in a statement: \u201cIt is absurd that valuable parliamentary time is being wasted debating a matter raised as part of the American presidential election.\u201d  (Additional reporting by Stephen Addison, Editing by Michael Holden and Janet Lawrence) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Numerous voting machines in heavily Democratic Detroit showed a greater number of ballots than poll workers records said were  cast in the Nov. 8 presidential election, the Detroit News reported on Tuesday. About 37 percent of precincts in Wayne County, Michigan, where Detroit is located, showed such discrepancies, the newspaper reported, citing records prepared at its request by the county. Voting irregularities in Detroit have prompted the state to audit the election results in the city, the newspaper said. Michigan was one of three rust belt states in which the campaign of Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein  requested a recount of the presidential election. Those efforts came to an end in Michigan on Friday when the Michigan Supreme Court refused to review an appeal of a lower court order barring a recount. On Monday, all three efforts were suspended after weeks of legal wrangling yielded a recount in Wisconsin only, and it favored Republican winner Donald Trump.

Meanwhile, Wisconsin election officials said on Monday they had completed a 10-day recount that found Trump\u2019s margin of victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton had increased by 131 votes.

        "text": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s chief justice said the national police chief had  enhanced  the security of Supreme Court judges after one of their bodyguards was shot, denying a Reuters report that a request for extra security had been turned down.  The judges  safety was thrust into focus last week after the shooting, which occurred on Tuesday evening. The next day, five out of seven judges failed to come to court to issue a judgment on an election petition seeking to delay the next day s presidential poll, sparking widespread speculation of intimidation. A senior judicial source told Reuters earlier this week that after the shooting the judges, who are normally allocated one bodyguard, had requested another vehicle, known as a  chaser car , to follow or go ahead of them as they moved around the country. The source, who was not available to speak on Thursday, said this request was turned down.  The source also said the judges were upset at the government s characterisation of the shooting as a crime rather than an attempt to intimidate judges who had recently annulled the August election victory of President Uhuru Kenyatta. The statement, issued by Chief Justice David Maraga s office late on Wednesday, said the story was wrong.  To the contrary, the Inspector General of Police has in fact enhanced the security of Supreme Court judges,  it said.  It did not give further details.  Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu had been allocated six police to guard her after the shooting of her bodyguard, who is in hospital in stable condition. He declined to comment on whether any other judges had requested extra security, but noted that both the interior minister and chief of police had promised they could have whatever they requested.  He said he was not able to give details of the extra security provided because  that in itself would be a breach of security protocols .  Kenyatta won the repeat presidential poll on Oct. 26 with 98 percent of the vote after opposition leader Raila Odinga withdrew from the race, saying it would not be fair.  The repeat election was ordered by the Supreme Court after it nullified the results of a poll on Aug. 8 due to procedural irregularities. The election board said Kenyatta won that election by 1.4 million votes. ",

        "title": "Trump plays left and right in drive to protect 'Dreamers'",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and top aides have urged conservative Republicans in Congress to craft legislation protecting \u201cDreamers\u201d brought illegally to the United States as children, a move that could jeopardize efforts to work with Democrats on the issue. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and other officials have reached out to more than a dozen Republicans, including some of the loudest anti-immigration voices in Congress. The consultations followed a dinner Trump held earlier this month with the top two congressional Democrats, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi. The president discussed with the two Democrats legislation to shield from deportation roughly 800,000 young immigrants known as Dreamers. In comments that angered Trump\u2019s conservative political base, White House officials said Trump would not necessarily insist on funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border as a condition for helping the Dreamers. Trump\u2019s pledge to build a border wall was a central theme of his 2016 presidential campaign. Earlier this month, Trump rescinded an Obama-era program that shielded Dreamers from deportation, but gave the Republican-controlled Congress - long gridlocked over immigration - six months to come up with legislation to address the issue. The recent consultations with Republicans included a dinner that Pence hosted for a group of conservative lawmakers at his residence. Republican Representative Mark Walker, who attended the dinner with Pence, said the administration was delivering a stark warning: Trump wants conservatives to participate in offering ideas for a Dreamer bill. If they do not, they will be frozen out of the discussions. Walker, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, said White House officials had made clear that Trump was willing to work with Democrats and moderate Republicans on a Dreamer bill if that was the only option. The outreach to conservatives suggests the administration is trying to minimize the potential backlash from Trump\u2019s base over the Dreamer issue. Many conservatives staunchly oppose protection from deportation for any illegal immigrants, viewing it as a form of amnesty. But any effort to bring conservatives on board with legislation could alienate Democrats. Among other Republicans who have been contacted by the administration are House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Representative Steve King and Senator Tom Cotton, who have pushed hard for strict immigration limits and tougher law enforcement. The White House said administration officials had also reached out to other Republicans, like Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, who in the past participated in negotiations on immigration reform. A White House official told Reuters that in conversations with Republicans, the administration was offering \u201cprinciples\u201d for Dreamer legislation that included building the border wall and expanding the use by companies of the \u201cE-verify\u201d system to check the legal status of new hires. Both are initiatives Democrats strongly oppose. Republican Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus, said there had been \u201congoing conversations\u201d between lawmakers and the administration. He added members of his caucus were looking at ideas for an immigration bill. A senior Democratic aide said Democratic leaders were awaiting an offer from the White House that would build on Trump\u2019s mid-September agreement to collaborate on a Dreamer bill. The aide said Democrats \u201clook forward\u201d to engaging Trump on a border security package sketched out at the dinner with the president, which did not include most of the conservative ideas now being floated in Congress.

        "title": "Trump says 'something could happen' on climate accord",
        "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - President Donald Trump held the door open to a reversal of his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord on Thursday, but did not say what he would need in return to persuade him to do so. Trump, who has made few friends in Europe with his rejection of the 2015 Paris agreement and his \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade stance, met with French President Emmanuel Macron as both leaders sought common ground to reset an awkward relationship. \u201cSomething could happen with respect to the Paris accords, let\u2019s see what happens,\u201d Trump told a news conference. \u201cIf it happens, that will be wonderful, and if it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019ll be OK too.\u201d Trump has said the Paris accord is soft on leading polluters like China and India, putting U.S. industry at risk. \u201cI respect the wish to preserve jobs, I think that\u2019s compatible with the Paris accord,\u201d Macron said at the joint conference. \u201cThere is no sudden and unexpected change today, otherwise we would have announced it, but there is the shared intention to continue discussing these issues,\u201d the French president added.  Trump and Macron\u2019s relationship got off to a bumpy start, but both have an incentive to improve relations - Macron hopes to elevate France\u2019s role in global affairs, and Trump, seemingly isolated among world leaders, needs a friend overseas. Trump came to France beset by allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, with emails released on Tuesday suggesting his eldest son welcomed an offer of Russian help against his father\u2019s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Weeks after Macron hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles, Trump will bask in the trappings of the Bastille Day military parade on Friday and commemorations of the entry 100 years ago of U.S. troops into World War One.  Macron welcomed Trump with a warm handshake and smiles, a contrast to the clenched-jaw greeting they shared at their first encounter in May. \u201cEmmanuel, nice to see you. This is so beautiful,\u201d the U.S. president told Macron as they met at the Hotel des Invalides where Napoleon Bonaparte and other French war heroes are buried. For the 39-year-old Macron, France\u2019s youngest leader since Napoleon two centuries ago, the visit is a chance to use soft diplomacy to win Trump\u2019s confidence and set about influencing U.S. foreign policy, which European leaders say lacks direction. Macron views it as counter-productive to isolate the United States on the world stage, and said he and Trump had asked diplomats to draw up in the coming weeks a concrete initiative aimed at preparing the future of Syria. \u201cOn the Iraq-Syria situation, we have agreed to continue working together, in particular on the building of a roadmap for the post-war period,\u201d Macron said. Trump said work was underway to negotiate a ceasefire in a second region of Syria. On Friday, Trump will be guest of honor at France\u2019s July 14 celebrations, a year after a Tunisian man loyal to Islamic State ploughed a truck through revelers on a seafront promenade in Nice, killing more than 80. During the U.S. election campaign, Trump said a wave of militant attacks showed \u201cFrance is no longer France\u201d, and reprimanded the then-Socialist government for allegedly bowing its head to jihadists. In bringing Trump to Paris, Macron has stolen a march on Britain\u2019s embattled Prime Minister Theresa May. London\u2019s offer of a state visit for Trump met fierce domestic criticism and warnings that he would be greeted by mass protests. An Elabe poll showed that 59 percent of French people approved of Macron\u2019s decision to invite Trump. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Monday he would sign a proposed rule on Tuesday to begin withdrawing from the Clean Power Plan, former President Barack Obama\u2019s centerpiece regulation to fight climate change. \u201cHere\u2019s the president\u2019s message: The war on coal is over,\u201d EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told a gathering in the Kentucky coal-country town of Hazard. Green groups criticized Monday\u2019s announcement and praised the plan, a collection of emissions standards for U.S. states that the Obama administration imposed to reduce pollution from power plants \u2014 the largest emitters of greenhouse gases \u2014 by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.  \u201cNo matter who is in the White House, the EPA is legally required to limit dangerous carbon pollution, and the Clean Power Plan is an achievable, affordable way to do that,\u201d said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune. But trade organizations like the National Association of Manufacturers, which participated in a legal challenge to the plan, praised it. \u201cThis regulation was broader than what the law allows,\u201d said NAM Vice President Ross Eisenberg. \u201cAt the same time, we recognize the need for a policy to address greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d  The effort to undo the plan is part of a broader target of the administration of President Donald Trump to revive the coal industry and boost domestic fossil fuels production. The EPA now says the Clean Power Plan introduced by Obama in 2015 was illegal. Pruitt said the Obama-era plan gave the government too much influence in the competition to generate power in the United States.  Jim Matheson, chief executive of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, an electric utility group, agreed. He said ending the plan would take pressure off some cash-strapped utilities that still relied on coal-fired power plants. But he said market forces were already moving utilities away from coal.  Total power generation by coal among the NRECA\u2019s members fell from 71 percent in 2014 to 62 percent in 2016, Matheson said.  The EPA has not decided whether it will replace the Clean Power Plan, according to a draft of the proposal seen by Reuters on Friday, or whether or when it will propose a new rule to regulate emissions from existing power plants. But the agency said it would soon solicit information on a potential replacement. ",

        "text": "JERUSALEM/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Five projectiles from Syria set off air raid sirens in Israeli towns on Saturday, prompting the Israeli military to say it would step up its response to stray fire from the Syrian war that has repeatedly spilled over the border. The projectiles crossed into the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the military said it targeted three Syrian artillery guns in response. No damage or injuries were reported in Israel. The Syrian military said it came under attack in Quneitra province, which sits near the Golan Heights territory that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War.   The Israeli enemy assaulted one of our military positions this morning, which led to material damages,  it said. During Syria s more than six-year-old conflict, Israel has returned fire across the border, including stray shells from fighting among Syrian combatants.  The Israeli military statement suggested it may start escalating such retaliations.  Whether errant fire or not, any future occurrences will force the Israel Defense Forces to intensify its response,  it said.  Israel  holds the Syrian regime responsible and won t tolerate any attempt to breach Israeli sovereignty,  it added. Syria s foreign ministry warned of  the grave consequences of such repeated aggressive acts  which it called a flagrant violation in a letter to the United Nations, state media said. The Syrian military said it held Israel responsible.  Israel has also carried out targeted air strikes in Syria during the war, alarmed by the expanding influence of Iran, the Syrian government s ally. The Israeli air force says it has struck arms convoys of the Syrian military and Lebanon s Iran-backed Hezbollah nearly 100 times in recent years. Iran s military chief warned Israel against breaching Syria s airspace and territory on a visit to Damascus this week. The general signed an agreement with his Syrian counterpart to further boost military cooperation, Iranian state news agency IRNA said on Saturday.  Rebel factions fighting the Damascus government in the multi-sided war hold swathes of Quneitra, while the army and allied militias control another part of the province.  Both warring Syrian sides accused each other of prompting the Israeli attack on Saturday.  The army said militants in nearby territory fired mortar rounds into the Golan Heights. A rebel official in Quneitra said pro-government fighters had been shelling insurgent-held parts of the province, when some of the shells fell on the Golan Heights. ",

        "title": "Pope advised not to use term 'Rohingya' in Myanmar but rights groups disagree",
        "text": "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Leading figures in the Catholic Church and international politics have advised Pope Francis not to use the term Rohingya during a trip to Myanmar due to political sensitivities but human rights groups want him to uphold international law on self-identity. Hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya have fled Myanmar following a military crackdown that the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing. Majority Buddhist Myanmar rejects the term Rohingya and does not recognize them as citizens nor as an ethnic group in its own right. In the run-up to the his Nov. 27-Dec. 2 trip to Myanmar and Bangladesh, several high-profile figures including former U.S. Secretary General Kofi Annan and Myanmar Cardinal Charles Maung Bo have indicated he should not use the term Rohingya. The pope, a less predictable figure than his predecessor who has overruled advisors in the past, has used the term Rohingya before, and it is widely employed by international institutions such as the United Nations and governments including the United States. The Vatican, which does not make comments on papal speeches ahead of trips, would not say if Francis might heed the advice and use a term like  Muslims in Rakhine State . Roman Catholics make up a tiny minority in Myanmar. Francis, a strong defender of human rights and migrants,  has spoken earlier this year of  the persecution of our Rohingya brothers and sisters  and has defended their right to  live their culture and Muslim faith . This month Annan met the pope along with three other members of  The Elders  group of veteran statesmen and women and later hinted strongly that he believed the pope should not say Rohingya. Annan, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and author of an advisory commission report on Rakhine State given to the Yangon government in August, met the pope on the evening of November 6. The Vatican gave no details of the meeting but at a breakfast with a few reporters the next day, Annan was asked if he agreed with those who say the pope s use of the word Rohingya while he is in Myanmar could be  incendiary .  They are right,  Annan said. Annan gave the pope a copy of his 63-page report, which does not use Rohingya but refers only to  Muslims in Rakhine State .  (The word) is so emotional,  he said. Asked if he believed that message had been conveyed to the Vatican, Annan nodded. Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister and U.N. conflict mediator called the report  quite substantial . Human rights groups hope the pope does not pull his punches in Myanmar.  The Rohingya have little left besides their group name after years of statelessness, discriminatory restrictions on movement and access to life-sustaining services, and being targeted by a military subjecting them to ethnic cleansing and atrocities,  said Phil Robertson, deputy director for Human Rights Watch in Asia.  The Pope absolutely should stand up for the Rohingya by using the name Rohingya,  he said in an email. Myanmar has denied U.N. accusations of ethnic cleansing. The government says the clearance operation in Rakhine State was necessary for national security after Rohingya militants attacked 30 security posts and an army base in August. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi assumed power in 2016 in a  landslide election win after former military leaders initiated a political transition. Asked if the pope should say Rohingya, Laura Haigh, London-based Myanmar expert for Amnesty International, said:  International law recognizes the right of a group to self-identify. It comes down to a principled stand.  Father Bernardo Cervelera, head of the Catholic news agency AsiaNews, said the pope should follow the local Church s advice in the country, which has some 700,000 Catholics in a population of more than 51 million that is mostly Buddhist.  Both the Church there and Aung San Suu Kyi are in a delicate position and I think the pope knows that,  he said. In 2015, Pope Francis angered Turkey when he used the word  genocide  to describe the World War One mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks. The Turkish government, which denies that the deaths constituted a genocide, recalled its ambassador to the Vatican in protest. ",

After the accident, passengers were taken to hospitals, bus company Costa Maya said in a statement. Five have been discharged and the injured were in stable condition, it said. The government of Quintana Roo said in a statement that it was investigating the cause of the accident. The U.S. embassy in Mexico said it was working with authorities to learn whether U.S. citizens were aboard the bus. Last year, 11 tourists were killed in a crash in Quintana Roo when their bus flipped en route to Cancun, the Associated Press reported. ",

        "title": "U.S. derivatives regulator to move on from Dodd-Frank under Trump",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. derivatives regulator will move on from reforms undertaken after the 2007-09 financial crisis to a new focus on U.S. competitiveness and the potential for shocks to the global $710 trillion swaps markets under President-elect Donald Trump. J. Christopher Giancarlo, in line to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission once Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20, has said the agency should look beyond mandates from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to current trends in financial markets. He counts among those cyber threats, liquidity risk, market concentration and de-globalization. As the sole Republican on the CFTC, Giancarlo will at least temporarily run the commission where he is currently the minority member.  Even if Trump later nominates someone else for the permanent post, Giancarlo, who was previously an executive vice president at GFI Group, a wholesale brokerage that runs electronic trading platforms, will be influential in the coming months. In a speech in London on Friday, he said regulators should foster best practices for new trading technologies, address diminishing liquidity, and review regulations that could cause market fragmentation as they enter \u201cthe new year and, perhaps, a new regulatory environment.\u201d This week, he forced the commission to delay limits on the positions that traders can hold on physical commodity futures and swaps. Redrawn position limit rules are likely to reappear in 2017, as are the following other agenda items. Giancarlo has often argued the United States should not move too far ahead of other countries in tightening regulations governing the swaps market, which the United States dominates. That could put U.S. firms at a disadvantage and drive up trading costs, he says.  In August he warned the CFTC could create a liquidity crunch by sticking to its September deadline for implementing a new swaps margin rule, given European regulators had delayed start dates for their similar rules. Indeed, in September Asian swaps markets foundered and trades fell through as the U.S. rules came online. The CFTC then gave swap dealers an extra month to comply. \u201cChampioning American markets means no longer asking U.S. market participants to go it alone and take it on the chin in implementation of global regulatory reform,\u201d Giancarlo later told the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cRather, it means standing up for America\u2019s capital and risk transfer markets and treating them as the vital national interests that they are.\u201d  Giancarlo sees the CFTC as \u201cstuck in a 20th Century time warp\u201d when it comes to technology.  He can be expected to push the CFTC toward giving industry space for breakthroughs in artificial intelligence guiding trade execution, \u201csmart\u201d contracts that calculate payments and value in real-time, and distributed ledger technology, known as Blockchain.  In November he voted against the \u201cReg AT\u201d - Regulation Automated Trading - to update oversight of fast computer trades,  criticizing it for not adequately protecting algorithmic trading companies\u2019 prized source codes and being too prescriptive.  Giancarlo says regulators in other countries, notably Britain, are leading the way in financial technology and the CFTC must follow in making room to experiment. Since 2012, any dealer with more than $8 billion in swap activity has had to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which subjects it to stricter federal oversight. That activity value in dollars, known as the \u201cde minimis\u201d threshold, was poised to fall to $3 billion by the end of 2017, but the CFTC recently delayed the drop by a year. Under Giancarlo, the threshold may never fall - or could disappear altogether.  He has called the thresholds \u201cmade up numbers\u201d lacking policy justification. He also said that in general, a specific de minimis level may not do anything to optimize \u201cthe safety, soundness, liquidity or vibrancy of U.S. swaps markets.\u201d  In March, Giancarlo failed to launch recommendations on regulating energy markets made by a committee he led, which was dominated by people from the energy sector. Reform proponents said the suggestions were sops to industry and he withdrew its report. When he is in charge, Giancarlo could turn back to the committee\u2019s work. It questioned the need for new position limits and suggested an alternative \u201caccountability system,\u201d where exchanges could grant exemptions to limits. ",

The four East Timorese were allowed into the Philippines but authorities kept their passports until a formal order is issued clearing their entry, said Rhoda Viajar, media relations of the ASEAN Civil Society Conference/ASEAN People s Forum. Immigration authorities said the four were held upon arrival on Saturday morning because they could not explain the purpose of their travel and were  not able to establish financial capacity for the visit .  The civil society conference organizers understand the more stringent security measures being implemented due to the upcoming ASEAN summit,  Viajar said. She said they  remain concerned about the possibility of similar incidents upon the arrival of many more participants from other countries . Since 2005, ASEAN leaders have held a dialogue with the region s top civil society groups to listen to development concerns and address critical issues such as poverty, health and education. Philippines security forces are deploying nearly 60,000 army and police personnel during the Nov. 10-14 ASEAN and East Asia Summit to ensure the safety of 19 world leaders and thousands of delegates from 10 Southeast Asian nations and 10 other dialogue partners, including U.S. President Donald Trump.  We have not monitored any real and direct threat in the national capital region, but we are not complacent,  national police chief Ronald dela Rosa told reporters after reviewing security preparations on Sunday.  There could be threats but we are ready and we are up to the challenge.  Police will deploy 400 mobile patrol cars, 200 motorcyles, 22 armored vehicles and 100 bomb-sniffing dogs to ensure the security and safety of leaders, officials and delegates to the biggest regional summit in Manila this year.     Some areas will be completely locked down, such as where heads of state and governments will hold meetings. Main roads running from the former U.S. air force base about 90 kms north of Manila to the venues will be partly closed. Interior Undersecretary Catalino Cuy said there was no plan to jam mobile phone signals to prevent potential crude bomb attacks because this would cause inconvenience for state officials and security personnel.

        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Some top Chinese officials are guilty of practicing sorcery and would rather believe in gurus and Western concepts of democracy than the Communist Party, a senior minister wrote on Thursday, warning of the danger they presented to its survival. China guarantees freedom of religion for major belief systems such as Buddhism, Christianity and Islam, but party members are meant to be atheists and are barred from what it calls superstitious practices, such as visits to soothsayers. Recent years have seen several cases of officials jailed as part of President Xi Jinping s crackdown on corruption being accused of superstition, part of the party s efforts to blacken their names. Some senior officials in leadership positions had  fallen morally , their beliefs straying from the correct path, wrote Chen Xi, the recently appointed head of the party s powerful Organisation Department that oversees personnel decisions.  Some don t believe in Marx and Lenin but believe in ghosts and gods; they don t believe in ideals but believe in sorcery; they don t respect the people but do respect masters,  he wrote in the official People s Daily, referring to spiritual leaders or gurus. People in China, especially its leaders, have a long tradition of turning to soothsaying and geomancy to find answers to their problems in times of doubt, need and chaos. The practice has grown more risky amid Xi s war on graft, in which dozens of senior officials have been imprisoned. Attacking officials whose faith in communism is wavering, Chen said some consider it an  entirely unreal mirage , and have lost faith in socialism. Instead, they look to Western concepts of the separation of power and multi-party systems as their ideal, added Chen, who also runs the Central Party School that trains rising officials. He did not name any officials guilty of practicing superstition or fawning over the West. But elsewhere in the article he named some of those caught up in the most high-profile recent cases, such as the feared former domestic security chief, Zhou Yongkang and the former party boss of Chongqing, Sun Zhengcai, sacked for corruption in July. They were  political careerist plotters , whose cases showed that officials  political problems were no less a threat to the party than corruption, Chen wrote.  The higher the position, the greater their platform, the greater the harm they caused to the party,  he added.  ",

        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Advisers to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pledged to U.S. agricultural groups that he will give growers and states a say on national farm policy should he be elected, two association leaders said on Friday. Eleven groups representing farmers, seed companies and other players in the sector met for the first time with Trump\u2019s top agricultural advisers in Washington on Monday to make recommendations on policy, following a similar meeting with representatives of rival Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in June. The presidential candidates\u2019 agriculture policies are crucial, agricultural groups say, because net U.S. farm income this year is forecast to drop to its lowest since 2002, largely due to a decline in grain prices. If that happens, incomes will be down 56 percent from a recent high of $123.3 billion in 2013. For Trump\u2019s team, the meeting came as he has tried to be more disciplined and on message as he seeks to reset his campaign against Clinton for the Nov. 8 election. He reshuffled top campaign leaders this week, and on Friday accepted the resignation of campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Agricultural trade, labor, crop insurance and food safety were among the topics discussed at the meeting with farm groups, which included Charles Herbster, national chairman of Trump\u2019s agricultural advisory committee, and Sam Clovis, Trump\u2019s chief policy advisor, participants told Reuters. Former Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman, who is on Trump\u2019s advisory committee, also attended, they said. \u201cThere was an assertion that farmers will be at the tables to make decisions, and that was well received by myself and our colleagues,\u201d said Barb Glenn, chief executive officer of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture.  Also, there was a focus on \u201cthe concept that the states need to be brought in to work with the federal government,\u201d she said. Clinton\u2019s campaign staff have previously made similar comments to farm groups, said Jay Vroom, chief executive officer of pesticide association CropLife America, who attended meetings with representatives of both candidates. \u201cBoth of them are quite interested in understanding where American ag is at,\u201d he said. Trump on Tuesday named 64 people to his agricultural advisory committee, including six U.S. governors, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture secretary, and the chairmen of the U.S. House and Senate agriculture committees. The latest RealClearPolitics average of national opinion polls puts Clinton 6 percentage points ahead of Trump, at 47.2 percent to 41.7 percent.  ",

        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservative Bavarian allies meet the leader of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) on Wednesday to start exploring the possibility of governing together. The two groups have ruled in a  grand coalition  for the last four years, but the SPD had vowed to go into opposition after voters rewarded it with its worst-ever post-war election result. The collapse of talks on a three-way coalition forced the SPD to re-consider in the interests of political stability. The conservative bloc and SPD are likely to clash over healthcare, immigration, Europe, work regulations and pensions. The SPD wants to introduce  citizen insurance,  to end the differences between Germany s private and public systems which, it argues, cater for the rich and poor respectively. The SPD wants everyone to be insured in the same way via citizen insurance. However, conservatives, including Merkel, have rejected this, saying switching to one healthcare system would decrease market competition and lead to worse healthcare. The SPD wants to stabilize pensions at 48 percent of the average wage by 2030, to be financed from reserves in the pension fund in the next few years. It aims to raise the contribution rate faster from 2024. The total cost of the SPD s proposal will amount to 19.2 billion euros ($22.55 billion) in 2030. The conservatives want to first form a commission to debate what is necessary to do.  The two parties agree in broad terms on a pro-Europe agenda for Germany, but the SPD wants deeper integration than the conservatives. SPD leader Martin Schulz has called for closer EU integration, with the aim of achieving a  United States of Europe  by 2025. This goes too far for Merkel s conservatives. [L8N1O90IU] Last October, Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) agreed with her conservative Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU), to put a number on how many people Germany would accept per year on humanitarian grounds. The SPD rejects such a cap. The two parties also disagree on the suspension of family reunifications for asylum seekers who were granted humanitarian protection in Germany.  The SPD is against a conservative plan to extend a suspension for reunifications which will expire in March 2018.  The two blocs are also at odds on the repatriation of Syrian refugees accused of crimes. [L1N1NZ1LI] ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump met with business leaders on Wednesday including Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk and real estate developers, as the administration seeks partnerships with the private sector to boost infrastructure spending. During his presidential campaign, Trump said he would push for a $1 trillion infrastructure program to rebuild roads, bridges, airports and other public works projects, but he has not presented a specific plan. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said \u201cstrong public-private partnerships\u201d would be key to rebuilding the nation\u2019s roads, bridges and airports. \u201cInfrastructure used to be a point of American pride, but now an overbearing, ineffective regulatory system can keep projects in limbo for years,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cThe government has wasted too much of the taxpayers\u2019 money on inefficient and misguided projects.\u201d The White House sees infrastructure as a potential large job creator but officials have said the federal government cannot shoulder the entire burden. The administration is looking at toll roads, tax credits and other ways to spur private investment. Major real estate and private equity executives attended the meeting, including developer Richard LeFrak, Vornado Realty Trust Chief Executive Officer Steve Roth, and Apollo Global Management co-founder\u00a0Josh Harris, the White House said.  LeFrak and Roth have been tapped to lead an infrastructure council that Trump plans to create, a spokesman for LeFrak had previously said. The lunch with the CEOs follows his meeting on Tuesday with AFL-CIO union President Rich Trumka to talk infrastructure and other issues. The White House held a meeting of 15 federal agencies last Thursday to begin work on the administration\u2019s infrastructure plan. Last month, Trump touted the infrastructure plan in an address to Congress. \u201cTo launch our national rebuilding,\u201d he said, \u201cI will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States - financed through both public and private capital - creating millions of new jobs.\u201d Edward Mortimer, a transportation expert at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told a Senate panel on Wednesday that without action, the federal highway trust fund would face a serious shortfall starting in 2020, and policymakers would need to come up with $150 billion over six years to maintain current spending. \u201cThis shortfall will likely result in significant uncertainty, with states possibly delaying major transportation projects,\u201d he said. Wednesday\u2019s meeting included Vice President Mike Pence, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, as well as General Atlantic CEO Bill Ford, McKinsey & Co partner Tyler Duvall and Nature Conservancy Managing Director Lynn Scarlett, the White House said. Scarlett said in a statement that any infrastructure package should include \u201cnatural\u201d solutions such as reefs, dunes and wetlands. Other participants in the meeting did not comment or respond to requests for comment.   The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded U.S. infrastructure at D+ and estimated the country needs to invest $3.6 trillion by 2020. In January, Trump signed an executive order aimed at expediting environmental reviews and approvals for all infrastructure projects, especially high-priority projects such as improving the U.S. electric grid and telecommunications systems and repairing and upgrading \u201ccritical\u201d port facilities, airports, pipelines, bridges, and highways.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump nominated former Republican lawmaker Scott Garrett as president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States on Friday, completing an about-face over an institution he had denounced as \u201cfeatherbedding\u201d for big business. A White House statement also named Spencer Bachus, another Republican former congressman, to be a member of the board of directors of the bank. Both were named for four-year terms. Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday he would fill the two vacancies on the bank\u2019s five-member board that have prevented it from having a quorum and being able to act on loans over $10 million. His picks must gain approval from the Senate, which blocked nominees by former President Barack Obama. The Export-Import Bank, an independent government agency, provides loans to foreign entities that enable them to purchase American-made goods. For example, it has been used by foreign airlines to purchase planes from Boeing Co (BA.N) and farmers in developing nations to acquire equipment. The bank has become a popular target for conservatives, who worked in Congress to kill the institution, arguing that it perpetuates cronyism and does little to create American jobs. Trump\u2019s backing of the bank represents a victory for  manufacturers like Boeing and General Electric Co (GE.N), which have overseas customers that use the agency\u2019s government-backed loans to purchase their products. Trump told the Journal the bank benefits small businesses and creates jobs, a reversal of his earlier criticism of the bank as being \u201cfeatherbedding\u201d for wealthy corporations. Trump\u2019s about-face followed a meeting on Tuesday with former Boeing Chief Executive Jim McNerney, who left the company last year but oversaw the corporation\u2019s aggressive lobbying effort in support of the bank in 2015. Large American corporations that do significant amounts of exports say other countries have similar agencies and the export bank levels the playing field. A 2015 fight to shutter the bank led by conservatives in Congress allowed the bank\u2019s charter to expire for five months. After overwhelming bipartisan support emerged to renew the bank\u2019s charter, which is needed for it to operate, conservatives blocked nominees to the board, preventing it from financing large exports like aircraft and power turbines.

        "text": "ALMATY (Reuters) - The first prominent dissident to return to Uzbekistan since the death of its long-time leader was detained on arrival on Wednesday, his wife said, raising questions about the new president s efforts to change the country s image. Uzbek police took writer Nurulloh Muhammad Raufkhon away in handcuffs after he landed at Tashkent airport, and sent him to jail after questioning, Gulnara Otakhonova told Reuters in tears. Officers told her to bring him clothes and a lawyer but did not say what he was charged with, she added.  The interior ministry in mainly Muslim ex-Soviet state bordering Afghanistan did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Raufkhon had been in self-imposed exile in Turkey since 2016, when he was placed on a security blacklist after publishing a book that criticized former leader Islam Karimov.  Karimov, held responsible by Western governments for systematic human rights violations during his 25 years in power, died last September. His successor, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, has sought to present himself as a more liberal leader, and this month Raufkhon told Reuters in an interview that, despite harboring some misgivings, he would soon return home. In an open letter to Mirziyoyev last week, Raufkhon said his safe return would  suit the country which is repackaging itself in front of the world community as free and fair since you came to power . Improving Tashkent s image could help Mirziyoyev forge closer ties with the West and attract foreign investment to modernize the economy which has struggled to create enough jobs, forcing millions of Uzbeks to look for work abroad. Raufkhon s wife , said by telephone that she and their son had waited for several hours at the airport before seeing Raufkhon escorted outside in handcuffs, then taken to a police station. As she waited outside the police station later in the day, a police officer told her to hire a lawyer. In the evening, police told her they were taking Raufkhon to jail and instructed her to bring clothes for him, still without stating any charges, Otakhonova said. Steve Swerdlow, Uzbekistan researcher for Human Rights Watch, called Raufkhon s detention  troubling, particularly given reports authorities had informed him about his rehabilitation and the various steps President Mirziyoyev has taken to show this is a new political era in Uzbekistan . Mirziyoyev last month ordered the removal of 16,000 people, including Raufkhon, from the blacklist. But some of his reforms announced since the December election have suffered from setbacks or delays caused, according to Uzbekistan-based foreign diplomats, by interventions of Karimov-era security boss Rustam Inoyatov with whom Mirziyoyev effectively shares power.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives\u2019 Republican leader said on Tuesday that legislation to replace former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law would be completed this year, trying to dispel the idea that the party is retreating from its campaign promise to dismantle Obamacare quickly. \u201cThe question is how long does it take to implement the full replacement of Obamacare,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan told a news briefing. \u201cWe hope to get this done as fast as possible.\u201d Ryan was responding to questions about Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s weekend interview with Fox News in which he said it might take until next year to replace the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, which Republicans consider federal government overreach. Trump and congressional Republicans campaigned on a promise to scrap the 2010 healthcare law. But they are struggling to agree on a replacement for the law, which has enabled up to 20 million previously uninsured Americans to obtain health coverage. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll take till sometime into next year,\u201d Trump said.   On Tuesday at the White House, spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration was \u201coptimistic about getting this thing completed by this year.\u201d Spicer also said Trump still favors lowering drug prices as part of healthcare reform, with the government negotiating directly with companies on prices to be paid by the Medicare insurance program. Spicer said Trump was committed to using his \u201cskills as a businessman\u201d to drive pharmaceutical prices down. Ryan said it was important to get U.S. Representative Tom Price confirmed as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services soon, so he too can \u201cget to work with replacing\u201d the healthcare law. The Senate is expected to confirm Price this week. Ryan said he was not bothered by recent protests against dismantling Obamacare that have taken place at some Republican lawmakers\u2019 meetings with constituents. \u201cPeaceful protests are something we honor in this country,\u201d he said. While Republicans voted last month to start scrapping Obamacare, they missed a target date of Jan. 27 to begin drafting legislation. This raised some doubts about how quickly they will be able to undo the complicated law, even though they have the majority in Congress. At a recent congressional retreat, Republican leaders told lawmakers they hoped Congress would legislate the repeal by March or April, as part of a process known as budget reconciliation. But some Republicans, like Representative Tom McClintock, have said they think doing it this way will actually make repealing Obamacare \u201charder and slower, while further disrupting an already faltering healthcare market.\u201d ",

        "title": "American Muslims see Trump rhetoric fueling prejudice, hate incidents",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - About three months ago, Sarah Ibrahim\u2019s son came home from his fourth-grade class at a Maryland school with a disturbing question. \u201cWill I have time to say goodbye to you before you\u2019re deported?\u201d he said, according to Ibrahim, a Muslim Arab American who works at a federal government agency in Maryland. \u201cThe kids in his classroom were saying: \u2018Who\u2019s going to leave when Trump becomes president?\u2019\u201d said the 35-year-old mother. The incident happened a few months after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump \u2014 now the presumptive nominee \u2014 first called for a ban on Muslim immigrants and for more scrutiny at mosques after 14 people were killed in San Bernardino by a Muslim couple whom the FBI said had been radicalized. Trump intensified his anti-Muslim rhetoric after last week\u2019s mass shooting in Orlando, in which a U.S.-born Muslim man killed 49 people at a gay nightclub, calling for a suspension of immigration from countries with \u201ca proven history of terrorism\u201d. He reiterated his call for more surveillance of mosques and warned that radical Muslims were \u201ctrying to take over our children.\u201d  While Democratic and several Republican leaders have distanced themselves from Trump\u2019s comments, many American Muslims say his stance has fueled an atmosphere in which some may feel they can voice prejudices or attack Muslims without fear of retribution. \u201cWhat Trump did was make these hidden thoughts public. He gave people permission to speak out loud, he removed the shame associated with being prejudiced. People know that they won\u2019t be punished,\u201d Ibrahim told Reuters at a community iftar, the sundown meal during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment. Trump has rejected the criticism that his rhetoric is racist, and has said he is often misunderstood by the media and his opponents. A report by the Council on American-Islamic Relations and University of California, Berkeley released on Monday said the number of recorded incidents in which mosques were targeted jumped to 78 in 2015, the most since the body began tracking them in 2009. There were 20 and 22 such incidents in the previous two years, respectively. The incidents include verbal threats and physical attacks. Corey Saylor, CAIR\u2019s director of the department to monitor and combat Islamophobia, said there had been a spike in Islamophobic incidents in the wake of Orlando, including those  targeting mosques. \u201cTrump\u2019s rhetoric is a direct threat to American principles. He has mainstreamed anti-Constitutional ideas like banning or surveilling people based on faith,\u201d Saylor told Reuters. \u201cSuch divisive rhetoric contributes to a toxic environment in which some people take the law into their own hands and attack people of institutions they perceive as Muslim.\u201d CAIR says the last big spike in incidents targeting mosques was seen in 2010 following the controversy over locating an Islamic center near the site of the Sept. 11 attacks in New York. It said that lent \u201cadditional weight to the argument that levels of anti-Muslim sentiment follow trends in domestic U.S. politics, not international terrorism\u201d. American rabbis and preachers have also denounced Trump\u2019s rhetoric. Anti-Semitic incidents in the United States still outstrip those against Muslims. The Anti-Defamation League said last year there were 912 anti-Semitic incidents across the United States during the 2014 calendar year, up 21 percent from 2013. \u201cIf Muslims are not free and safe in America, then Christians and Jews are not free and safe in America,\u201d said Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president emeritus of the Union for Reform Judaism. Trump has also drawn criticism for his rhetoric against Latino immigrants, saying early in his campaign that Mexican \u201crapists\u201d and other criminals were coming across the border and calling for all undocumented immigrants to be deported. Manal Omar, a Muslim-American author based in Washington, said she has stopped taking the metro and walking alone late at night. \u201cI can\u2019t dismiss the tweets and angry messages I\u2019ve received from right wing militants,\u201d said Omar, who says she has grown especially vigilant after last week\u2019s murder of British lawmaker Jo Cox, whom she knew. A few days after the San Bernardino attack, Ilhaam Hassan\u2019s family restaurant was burned down in an arson attack in Grand Forks, North Dakota.  Matthew Gust pleaded guilty in May to federal hate-crime and arson charges. He admitted to setting the fire because of the national origin of the employees and customers at the restaurant \u2014 a focal point of the local Somali-American community. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to expect if he (Trump) becomes the president,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cHe is against minorities. He is against Islam. It\u2019s not a message of unity, it\u2019s a message of dividing the country and that is not what America is based on.\u201d ",

        "text": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s opposition leader Raila Odinga, who says he will boycott a presidential election re-run due next week, said on Friday he would announce a  way forward  the day before the scheduled poll, raising the possibility he might participate after all. At a memorial in western Kenya for opposition supporters killed in protests against the vote set for Oct. 26, Odinga told his supporters not to attack  innocent people  including people who support his rival President Uhuru Kenyatta. He did not comment on an announcement by the electoral board chief executive Ezra Chiloba earlier on Friday that he would take three weeks  leave. Kenya is holding the re-run after the Supreme Court threw out the result of an Aug. 8 election won by the incumbent Kenyatta but disputed by the challenger Odinga. The opposition leader has refused to participate in the re-run, arguing that reforms were needed first to prevent fraud. The opposition has demanded Chiloba resign, and the announcement that he will not participate in running the vote suggests progress in behind-the-scenes negotiations involving Western diplomats and religious and civil society leaders. Uncertainty over whether Odinga will participate in the election and concerns that it may not proceed peacefully have left Kenya, a traditionally stable Western ally in an often chaotic region, mired in political crisis. The volatile build-up to the Oct. 26 vote has revived memories for Kenyans of ethnically charged violence that killed around 1,200 people after a disputed election in 2007, when Odinga also lost and disputed the result. Chiloba told Reuters that, in light of the opposition s demands, he was going on leave, and that all arrangements for next week s vote were in place. At least 45 people died nationwide in a police crackdown on opposition supporters after the August vote, including a six-month old baby struck on the head by a police baton. With Odinga yet to respond to Chiloba s decision to go on leave, diplomats said they were unsure what would happen next.  The crystal ball is very cloudy at the moment,  a senior western diplomat in Nairobi told Reuters.  The situation is changing by the hour.  The electoral board has said next week s election will go ahead. Odinga met its chairman Wafula Chebukati on Thursday and later told reporters that if there were serious consultations and serious reforms, the opposition could review its boycott. Chebukati had said a day earlier that he could not guarantee the election would be free and fair, citing interference from politicians and threats of violence against colleagues. A fellow board member resigned this week after fleeing to the United States, saying she feared for her life. The opposition has held near-daily protests demanding electoral reforms and the sacking of board officials. Police said on Friday four people were killed as a result of their interventions to stop demonstrations.  Kenyatta has meanwhile urged Kenyans to come out in large numbers to vote, insisting the ballot be held. On Thursday, he snubbed an invitation to meet Chebukati, saying he would instead spend the time campaigning. In a speech in Nairobi on Friday, Kenyatta said the election must not divide the nation or push it to the brink. Disruptions of the vote by  those who thrive in chaos and relish anarchy  would not be tolerated, and security forces  have been enhanced and appropriately deployed to maintain law and order , he said.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three Republican U.S. lawmakers called on Friday for Robert Mueller to resign as special counsel investigating Russia and the 2016 U.S. election, the latest in a series of conservatives\u2019 criticisms of the FBI and Justice Department during the probe of how Moscow may have influenced the campaign. Representatives Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs and Louis Gohmert accused Mueller of a conflict of interest because he was director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation when former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration approved an agreement allowing a Russian company to buy a Canadian company that owned 20 percent of U.S. uranium supplies. President Donald Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans have been calling for an investigation into the Uranium One deal, amid news of Mueller\u2019s first indictments of Trump associates as the special counsel investigates allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. Moscow denies any effort to influence the election, and Trump has dismissed the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d On Monday, the day the indictments became public, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said a special counsel should be appointed to investigate Democrats over the uranium deal. Another group of Republican lawmakers, including House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte launched an investigation last week to examine issues including the role of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent, in the uranium deal. Democrats have dismissed the Republicans\u2019 activities as a partisan effort to distract from Mueller\u2019s probe and from efforts to ensure that a foreign government, Moscow, does not influence future U.S. elections. Gaetz, Biggs and Gohmert are all members of the House Judiciary Committee, which has oversight over the FBI and Department of Justice. Gaetz has called for investigations of issues related to Clinton previously, including accusing former FBI Director James Comey of colluding with Mueller on the FBI\u2019s investigation of Clinton\u2019s emails.

        "text": "(Reuters) - Growing numbers of U.S. states are seeking to ensure that women have continued access to free birth control in case the insurance benefit is dropped as part of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s vow to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The 2010 law, popularly called Obamacare, requires most health insurance plans to provide coverage for birth control without a patient co-payment, which can be as much as $50 per month for birth control pills or $1,000 for long-acting contraceptives such as intrauterine devices. California, Maryland, Vermont and Illinois since 2014 have enacted statutes codifying the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate in state law and expanding on the federal law\u2019s requirements. Democratic lawmakers in New York, Minnesota, Colorado and Massachusetts said they are pursuing similar measures this year, with Obamacare under mortal threat in Washington. New York\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, on Wednesday introduced such a measure in his state\u2019s legislature that would expand on the Obamacare contraception mandate. \u201cWomen across New York are very concerned that Republican efforts to repeal the ACA will mean the loss of the contraception on which they rely,\u201d Schneiderman said. \u201cI won\u2019t hesitate to act to protect New Yorkers\u2019 rights - including the right to choose, and the right to birth control - no matter what a Trump administration does,\u201d Schneiderman added, referring to abortion rights. Trump, who succeeds Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20, and his fellow Republicans in Congress have made dismantling Obamacare their \u201cfirst order of business,\u201d as Vice President-elect Mike Pence put it on Jan. 4. [nL1N1EU0RW] Republicans in Congress have not presented a detailed proposal for repealing and replacing the law but many Republicans and religious conservatives have opposed the Obamacare contraception mandate. [nL1N1EU0RW] Twenty-eight of the 50 states currently have laws requiring private insurers to provide coverage for birth control. But not all the laws affect all insurance plans, and only a few mandate cost-free birth control. OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES The Obamacare contraception mandate has applied since 2012 to most new insurance plans including employer-provided coverage. In 2013, for example, the mandate saved U.S. women more than $1.4 billion in out-of-pocket expenses for birth control pills, according to a report by University of Pennsylvania researchers. Almost 6.9 million privately insured U.S. women used the pill that year. The legislative move by some states, most of them Democratic governed, is designed to clear up uncertainty for some of the 55 million women who now have access to free contraceptives and related treatments under the Affordable Care Act. Conservatives also have chipped away at the Obamacare mandate in court. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that forcing family-owned businesses to pay for employee insurance coverage for birth control ran afoul of another federal law safeguarding religious freedom. The Supreme Court last May sent another legal challenge by nonprofit Christian employers back to lower courts to reconsider the matter after tossing out their rulings favoring the Obama administration. [nL2N18D0PL] \u201cI think it is even more important now,\u201d said Colorado state Representative Susan Lontine, who last year co-sponsored a contraception coverage bill in her state\u2019s legislature that did not get passed but she expects to be resurrected in 2017. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen on the federal level.\u201d California in 2014 became the first state to pass a contraception mandate that went further than the Obamacare language. Maryland, Vermont and Illinois last year passed laws that also eliminated co-pays for vasectomies and allowed women to fill a birth control prescription for at least six months rather than one to three.  The New York legislation would allow women to fill multiple months of a birth control prescription, prohibit private insurers from \u201cmedical management\u201d reviews that could limit or delay contraception coverage, and provide coverage for vasectomies without a co-pay. Within a matter of months, the Trump administration even without congressional action could drop contraception from Obamacare\u2019s list of preventive services that health insurance plans must cover without out-of-pocket costs, said Laurie Sobel, senior policy analyst at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. If repealed, some employers might choose to maintain the coverage without a co-pay because it is a relatively inexpensive benefit popular with employees. The proportion of privately insured women who paid nothing out of pocket for birth control pills increased from 15 percent in the fall of 2012 to 67 percent in the spring of 2014 during the time when the coverage went into wide effect, according to the Guttmacher Institute research organization. The no-cost contraceptives coverage also spurred women to switch to long-acting methods such as the IUD, which is offered in the United States by Bayer, Teva, Allergan and Medicines360, studies have found. More than 77 percent of women and 64 percent of men support the no-cost contraceptives coverage, according to a 2015 Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation survey. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States issued about 50 percent fewer visitor visas in April to citizens of seven countries covered by President Donald Trump\u2019s temporary travel bans than it did in an average month last year, according to a Reuters analysis of preliminary government data released on Thursday. The total number of U.S. non-immigrant visas issued to people from all countries was about 15 percent lower in April compared with the 2016 monthly average. The April data shows the continuation of a trend identified in data for the month of March, which the State Department released last month. That data showed that citizens of the seven Muslim-majority countries under the bans - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - received about 40 percent fewer visitor visas in March than in an average month last year.  [nL1N1HZ2PJ] Trump\u2019s travel bans have been blocked by the courts. Citizens of the seven countries received about 2,800 non-immigrant visas in April 2017, compared with about 5,700 on average per month during the 2016 fiscal year and more than 6,000 on average per month in 2015 and 2014. Data from previous years is only available in aggregate by fiscal year, rather than month-by-month. (tmsnrt.rs/2p8EFbm) The State Department released the data to comply with a directive from Trump asking it to publish monthly breakdowns of the number of visas issued around the world. The agency did not release data on the number of visa applications, so it is unclear whether the lower number of visas is because of a higher rate of rejections or other factors, such as fewer applicants or slower processing times. \u201cVisa demand is cyclical, not uniform throughout the year, and affected by various factors at the local and international level,\u201d said William Cocks, a spokesman for the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs. Trump, who has said the travel bans were intended to make Americans safer from attacks, signed an executive order on Jan. 27 barring people from the seven countries from entering the United States for 90 days. After the order was blocked by federal courts, the Trump administration replaced it with a revised, narrower ban which dropped Iraq from the list. Courts have also halted parts of the second order. On Thursday, a U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate the travel ban, calling it discriminatory and setting the stage for a showdown in the Supreme Court. [nL1N1IR1FY] Although visitor visas were down across the board for the seven targeted countries compared with last years\u2019 averages, Iraqis in April received 349 immigrant visas, which are typically given to those with jobs or family members in the United States, compared with 305 in an average month in 2016. Syrians also received more immigrant visas in April - 268 versus an average of 219 per month last year. All other countries targeted by one of Trump\u2019s bans received fewer immigrant visas in April than in an average month last year. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday he expects to unveil a proposal for overhauling the federal tax code this fall and to get legislation passed by the end of the year that includes a lower corporate tax rate. \u201cWe want America to wake up on New Year\u2019s Day 2018 with a new tax system,\u201d Ryan said in an interview with The New York Times. He said congressional tax writers were close to releasing their template for the tax system overhaul. Tax reform was a major campaign promise last year for President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress. But the effort has been hamstrung by repeated delays and political distractions since Trump took office in January. The president went on the road at the end of August to tout tax cuts as a way to help American workers and the middle class but Washington\u2019s attention soon shifted to hurricanes battering the southern United States and North Korea\u2019s latest nuclear test. Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said in a separate interview on Thursday with Fox Business Network that tax reform remains a top priority for the president.  Ryan said Trump was very engaged on tax reform and \u201cseriously involved in the details.\u201d The president has said he wanted to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. Ryan, in the Times interview, indicated a figure that low was unrealistic. \u201cThe numbers are hard to make that work. He obviously wants to push this as low as possible - I completely support doing that but at the end of the day we\u2019ve got to make these numbers work. \u201cOur goal is to be at or below the industrialized world average - and that\u2019s 22.5 (percent). So our goal is to get in the mid to low 20s. And we think that\u2019s an achievable goal.\u201d     ",

        "title": "Trump, under fire on many fronts, expands campaign team",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump, under pressure to show a more presidential image, elevated a top adviser on Thursday and said he planned to hire additional staff to prepare for the possibility of a long fight for the Republican nomination. The developments came as Trump tries to rebound from a loss in Wisconsin on Tuesday to U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a defeat that punctured the billionaire businessman\u2019s aura of inevitability and made it more likely the nominee will be picked in a floor fight at the Republican National Convention in July.  The Republican front-runner\u2019s stumble in Wisconsin exposed a variety of weaknesses. Trump alienated many female Republican voters by saying that women who have an abortion if the procedure were banned should be punished, a position he later backtracked on.  He also appeared to have been outmaneuvered in the scramble for delegates in Louisiana. Although Trump beat Cruz in that state on March 5, Cruz may end up with more delegates from Louisiana than Trump. Trump announced that he has assigned all functions related to the nomination process to veteran political operative Paul Manafort, who was hired to manage the process of corralling delegates who will pick the nominee. \u201cThe nomination process has reached a point that requires someone familiar with the complexities involved in the final stages,\u201d Trump said. Trump also canceled plans for a campaign swing through California in coming days in order to concentrate on New York, which has suddenly emerged as a must-win state for him on April 19. He has a big lead in his home state. A Trump campaign statement said that he will add to his team as the Republican National Convention nears and that he would announce new hires in the weeks ahead.  The expansion of Trump\u2019s campaign means his team will grow beyond the close-knit group of advisers who have been at his side since he jumped into the presidential race last June. Trump said he plans to open a Washington office next week. While there has been speculation that Trump might make Manafort his campaign manager, the candidate\u2019s statement made clear that current campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and deputy manager Michael Glassner would remain in their positions. Lewandowski has been charged with simple battery for grabbing a reporter who tried to ask Trump a question in Florida a month ago. Trump, famously loyal to people he trusts, has rejected calls that he fire Lewandowski. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - A life-sized nude statue of U.S. Republican presidential contender Donald Trump is going up for auction, with profits from the sale going to an immigrant support group. Julien\u2019s Auctions said on Wednesday that the statue, called \u201cThe Emperor Has No Balls,\u201d is expected to fetch $10,000 to $20,000 at the Oct. 22 auction in Los Angeles. The statue is one of a series that appeared unannounced in public spaces in New York and four other U.S. cities earlier in August. The orange-tinted likeness showed Trump with a massive belly, small fingers and some missing genitals. Most were confiscated or destroyed by local authorities and the Los Angeles statue is the only one remaining, Julien\u2019s said. The statues were created by an anonymous artists collective called INDECLINE. A portion of the auction profits will go to the National Immigration Forum, which campaigns for the rights of immigrants. Trump has pledged to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico to keep immigrants out and to deport the millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States, should he be elected. He is due to give a speech on Wednesday as he seeks to find a balance in his immigration stance. Trump is not the only politician to be represented in the October auction of street and contemporary art. American pop artist Knowledge Bennett\u2019s \u201cHillary Clinton Cojones,\u201d featuring the Democratic White House hopeful wearing a tuxedo, is expected to fetch up to $15,000, Julien\u2019s said.

Australian government ministers rarely make critical comments about elections in other countries, especially stalwart allies like the United States, which Australia relies on heavily for military backing in the Asia-Pacific. Australian Industry Minister Christopher Pyne, a cabinet member of the ruling conservative Liberal-National coalition, criticized the violence at recent Trump rallies and said that his rise was casting a pall over American democracy.  \u201cNow, democracy should be robust but it certainly shouldn\u2019t be violent,\u201d Pyne said in an interview on Australia\u2019s Channel Seven television network. \u201cAnd I think the Donald Trump phenomenon is a real problem for the United States, making their democracy look kind of weird,\u201d he said. Republican front-runner Trump warned on Wednesday of riots if he is denied the party\u2019s presidential nomination, only days after Trump supporters and protesters clashed at a rally for the Republican in Chicago that was later scrapped.

        "title": "Factbox: What's in Trump's order halting refugee program",
        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday his administration wants more rigorous screening of refugees and visitors from certain countries to prevent terrorist attacks. Here is what Trump\u2019s order on \u201cextreme vetting\u201d - denounced by civil rights groups as discriminatory - includes. The order bars the entry of foreign nationals from certain countries for 90 days. While no countries are specifically named in the order, it refers to a statute that would apply to seven Muslim-majority nations: Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Iraq. There is an exception for certain types of visas, including for diplomats and the United Nations. The temporary halt is aimed at giving the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and the Director of National Intelligence time to determine what information is needed from each country to ensure that visas are not issued to individuals posing a national security threat. The order calls for a review to create a single process for screening people entering the country, which could include holding more in-person interviews, searches of an expanded database of identity documents or longer application forms.  Under the current system, some visa applications require interviews but others do not. The government already has extensive databases but some believe they need to be expanded. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The order suspends the Visa Interview Waiver Program, which allows consular officers to exempt some applicants from face-to-face interviews if they are seeking to renew their temporary visas within a year of expiration. Immigration attorneys say the changes will make even routine applications much more complicated and time consuming and could mean that more people will need assistance to get through the visa process. In an attempt to ensure wait times for interviews are \u201cnot unduly affected,\u201d the order calls for the hiring of more consular fellows to work in U.S. embassies abroad.  The order calls for the temporary halt of all refugee admissions for four months so the government can study the process and determine if additional checks are necessary, although there will be case-by-case exceptions. The order\u00a0also implemented a blanket ban of all Syrian refugees until \u201csufficient changes\u201d have been made to the refugee program, without giving more details. After the suspension is lifted, the government will give priority to applicants that are suffering religious-based prosecution, but only if they are minorities in their country. Trump said in a television interview that the move would protect Christians. It could also protect ethnic minorities like the Yazidis in the Middle East. This could potentially open the door to legal challenges claiming religious discrimination, some legal experts say. Once refugee admissions resume, fewer will be allowed. The 2017 cap was set at 50,000 people, compared to 85,000 designated by President Barack Obama for 2016. In a nod to certain states and cities that have objected to refugee resettlement, the order also seeks to give state and local jurisdictions a role in deciding whether or not to allow people to live there. COMPLETING THE \u201cBIOMETRIC ENTRY-EXIT TRACKING SYSTEM\u201d The system is aimed at tracking foreign visitors\u2019 arrival and departure using information like finger prints. Former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration had aimed to start implementing biometric exit checks at the country\u2019s largest airports by\u00a02018. Some experts have said that for the system to work properly, it would need to cover all land, air, and sea ports of entry, which is a major undertaking. According to a 2014 report from the Bipartisan Policy Center the system would be expensive to implement and would \u201coffer mixed value for enforcement objectives.\u201d (This version of the story has been refiled to fix spelling of \u201cIraq\u201d in paragraph 3) ",

        "text": "KIEV (Reuters) - The release of two Crimean Tatars from Russian custody this week was a good sign and hopefully means Russia will take positive steps in eastern Ukraine as well, the U.S. special envoy to the Ukraine peace talks said on Saturday. Ukraine and Russia are at loggerheads over Russia s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and support for separatists in the Donbass region in a conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people despite a notional ceasefire.  Russia unexpectedly released a pair of Tatar activists on Wednesday thanks partly to an intervention by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. They have vowed to return to Crimea to campaign for the release of other prisoners.  The fact that they were released is a small positive sign,  Kurt Volker told Reuters on a visit to Kiev, where he met the freed men.  It s the kind of thing you hope you could build on that, Russia would build on that with some other steps with the Donbass,  he added.  A former ambassador to NATO, Volker was appointed in July by the Donald Trump administration to help resolve the Donbass conflict, which Washington cites as a key obstacle to better relations between the United States and Russia.  A recent sticking point is whether and how the United Nations should send a peacekeeping force to the region. Volker met Kremlin aide Vladislav Surkov in October for talks on this, which he said produced no breakthroughs but were  constructive .  What we are doing, is we are seeing whether we can create some common ideas for how a peacekeeping force could be useful in resolving the conflict,  Volker said, saying the force could only be effective with a stronger mandate than Russia envisages. Russia denies sending its own troops or sophisticated weaponry to helping the separatists.  Volker blamed Russian aggression for the Donbass conflict  but said a realization on Russia s part that the violence is against its interests could spur a change in Moscow s behavior.     The real issue is Russia s decision-making. Until now, Russia has been holding this territory, keeping this conflict alive, hoping that it provides some leverage over Ukraine,  Volker said.  The reality has sunk in I believe that this has actually produced the opposite. It has produced a Ukraine that is more unified, more nationalist, more anti-Russian, more westward-looking than ever existed before.   Volker also said the United States was  actively considering  supplying lethal defensive weapons to Kiev, a prospect that has riled Russia.  No-one has any worry about someone defending themselves unless they are an aggressor, so it should not be that controversial an issue,  Volker said.  ",

        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Three men wanted for the killing of Kim Jong Nam were driven to the murder site in a car bought by a North Korean embassy official, a Malaysian court was told on Wednesday, bringing into focus the embassy s role in the sensational murder. Two women, Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong, a Vietnamese, are charged with conspiring with four North Korean fugitives to kill the North Korean leader s half-brother using banned chemical weapon VX, at the Kuala Lumpur international airport on Feb. 13. Defense lawyers say the women were duped into thinking they were playing a prank for a reality TV show. Closed circuit television recordings played in court on Wednesday showed three of the fugitives at the airport in a car registered to a North Korean suspect named Ri Jong Chol. Jong Chol, who was arrested and deported shortly after the murder, told investigators the car had been bought in his name by a North Korean embassy official named Chal Su in October 2016, lead investigator Wan Azirul Nizam Che Wan Aziz said.  We made a request to the North Korean embassy to identify and question Chal Su, but did not receive any cooperation,  Wan Azirul told the court. Airport video recordings screened in court earlier showed the embassy s second secretary and a manager for North Korean airline Air Koryo helping the four fugitives flee immediately after the murder. Wan Azirul on Wednesday named the two individuals as North Korean embassy second secretary Hyon Kwang Song and Air Koryo manager Kim Uk Il. Both men had gone into hiding at the embassy in Kuala Lumpur, along with Ri Ji U, a 30-year-old North Korean also known as James, after warrants were issued for their arrest, Wan Azirul said. Police took statements from the embassy s second secretary and the Air Koryo official before releasing them, but did not pursue Ji U or Chal Su in the absence of instructions to do so, Wan Azirul said.  During this probe, which involves international issues, I faced many constraints in investigating and needed to refer to my superior officers before taking any action,  he added. North Korea has vehemently denied accusations by South Korean and U.S. officials that Kim Jong Un s regime was behind the killing. Kim Jong Nam, who was living in exile in Macau, had criticized his family s dynastic rule of North Korea and his brother had issued a standing order for his execution, some South Korean lawmakers have said. The murder unraveled once-close ties between Malaysia and North Korea. Malaysia was forced to return Kim Jong Nam s body and allow the suspects hiding in the embassy to return home, in exchange for the release of nine Malaysians barred from leaving Pyongyang. ",

        "text": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer will shuffle his cabinet in March and likely exclude members of his main allied party after many of its lawmakers turned against him this week, a senior government source said on Friday. The source, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the matter, said he did not expect the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) to be part of the future government.  The reshuffle follows the biggest revolt yet against Temer s 13-month government when the majority of PSDB lower-house deputies on Wednesday voted to put him on trial over corruption charges. The PSDB plans to field its own presidential candidate next year and may well quit Temer s coalition of its own accord as the elections draw closer, the source said. Though the lower house voted to shelve a corruption case against Temer, the upheaval in his ruling coalition is likely to derail Temer s plans to plug a budget deficit to help Brazil recover from its worst ever recession.  The planned cabinet changes will take place as ministers have to leave the cabinet by April to run in October elections.  Smaller allied parties have asked Temer to eject the PSDB from his government. It currently holds four cabinet posts. The source said Foreign Minister Aloysio Nunes, a member of the PSDB, might stay on even if his party leaves the government. Temer, whose popularity is at rock bottom, has no plans to run for re-election. His centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), Brazil s largest, has generally entered governments through coalitions with other parties and rarely fielded its own presidential candidate. Government officials expect the economy to pick up and grow at 3 percent by mid-2018, which would improve the PDMB s chances should it choose to do so. Such a candidate would likely be someone from outside the party and have to be untarnished by the corruption scandals battering Brazil s political class, the source said. ",

        "text": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Three hundred U.S. Marines flew out of Australia on Sunday as their troop rotation came to an end, the first of a 1,250-strong force to leave the Pacific nation after being stationed for six months in the country s far north. The sixth rotational group was the most advanced contingent to be sent since the program began after former U.S. President Barack Obama agreed to send troops in 2011 as part of a military pivot to the Asia-Pacific region. For the first time the rotation included an aviation combat section of 13 aircraft, including four MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, according to Australia s Department of Defence. Australian and U.S. troops also practiced disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as a combined force in a remote location for the first time. The rotational forces are stationed in Darwin, state capital of the Northern Territory, which is strategically located on the coastal doorstep of Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea. During the six-month deployment, the U.S. troops participated in 12 joint exercises with the Australian Defence Force, giving them an opportunity to interact with a range of countries including China, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.  Australia s alliance with the United States is our most important defense relationship and remains central to Australia s security,  Captain Bryan Parker, deputy commander of Australia s Northern Command, said in a statement.  The presence of the U.S. Marines across the Northern Territory plays a vital role in underwriting security and stability across the Indo-Pacific,  he said, adding that force posture initiatives were essential to preserving stability over the coming decades. Marine rotation numbers were originally expected to reach 2,500 by 2017 but so far have not risen above 1,250, according to ABC News reports. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dialing back the Volcker Rule that limits banks\u2019 ability to engage in speculative investments is a top priority for President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for U.S. Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, according to a document seen by Reuters on Monday. In written responses to questions posed by members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, Mnuchin said he would use his role as head of the interagency Financial Stability Oversight Council to give the Volcker Rule a stricter definition of proprietary trading.  In \u201cprop trading\u201d a financial firm uses its own money to invest in privately held companies, hedge funds and similar vehicles. The Volcker rule was designed to limit the type of risk-taking activities that helped land banks in trouble during the financial crisis. \u201cAs Chair of FSOC I would plan to address the issue of the definition of the Volcker Rule to make sure that banks can provide the necessary liquidity for customer markets and address the issues in the Fed report,\u201d Mnuchin wrote in the document, which also included senators\u2019 questions and was verified by a Senate aide. During his confirmation hearing with the Senate Finance Committee last week, Mnuchin cited a recent Federal Reserve report that found the rule, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform law, was limiting market liquidity. The committee has not yet scheduled a date to vote to send the nomination to the full chamber for approval. Regulators have applied proprietary trading prohibitions to too many activities, he said. The Fed report found that ambiguity and gray areas in the rule were pushing dealers to conservative strategies to ensure they did not cross the line on the prohibitions. In the responses Mnuchin also made it clear he believes the  rule should only apply to \u201ca bank that benefits from federal deposit insurance.\u201d The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guarantees retail deposits at about 6,000 banks, including the consumer banking arms of the country\u2019s largest investment banks. The law currently applies to banks that have access to the Federal Reserve\u2019s discount window or other government backstop.  Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat who serves on the Finance Committee, wrote that uninsured investment banks also pose risks that the rule, named for former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker, was supposed to address. \u201cAs we saw during the financial crisis, when nonbanking affiliates of FDIC insured banks failed, they were rescued by their insured affiliates, which in turn were forced to be rescued by taxpayers,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis was the case with State Street Bank, and your former employer, Goldman Sachs, which converted to a bank holding company in order to be eligible for federal bailout funds.\u201d Mnuchin reiterated that an updated version of the 1933 Glass-Steagall law that had long separated commercial and investment banking should be instated to reduce risks. The law was repealed in 1999. Mnuchin has not shared details of his \u201c21st Century Glass-Steagall,\u201d but hinted it would be looser than the original. \u201cA bright line between commercial and investment banking, although less complicated, may inhibit the necessary lending and capital markets activities to support a robust economy,\u201d he wrote.

        "text": "KAMPALA (Reuters) - South Sudanese soldiers are passing through the territory of neighboring Uganda to launch assaults against rebels, raising the risk of the civil war spilling over into neighboring East African countries, South Sudanese rebels and witnesses said. The four-year-old conflict in oil-rich South Sudan, the world s newest country, has created Africa s biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide, displacing nearly a third of its 12 million citizens. More than one million have sought refuge in Uganda.  In the latest development, rebel spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel said government soldiers from the Sudan People s Liberation Army (SPLA) crossed into Uganda at the border post of Nimule on Friday. They drove through the Ugandan towns of Moyo and Koboko before crossing back into South Sudan s Yei River state, he said. The Ugandan military and the SPLA both denied any incursions by SPLA troops in Uganda  Kaya, a town on Yei River 10 km (6 miles) from the Ugandan border, was the site of fighting between the military and rebels on Saturday that left 19 people dead, including an American journalist.  A Reuters journalist in Uganda saw three SPLA pickup trucks loaded with uniformed soldiers wearing red berets driving in the direction of Kaya on Friday. Another eyewitness in the Ugandan border town of Moyo told Reuters he saw trucks with men in South Sudanese military uniforms moving through the town on Friday morning.  Ugandan military spokesman Brigadier Richard Karemire denied these accounts:  There s absolutely no foreign military on Ugandan soil. We don t allow that.   Colonel Santo Domic Chol, a SPLA spokesman, also denied troops had passed through Ugandan territory. South Sudanese soldiers have been passing through northwest Uganda to reach rebel-held territory, residents there say. The route allows them to avoid poor roads and rebel blockades. In June, men wearing South Sudanese military uniforms launched town raids in a hamlet over the border in Uganda and stole cattle, in the first reported attacks on Ugandan soil since the start of South Sudan s civil war. Gabriel said they did not believe the Ugandan government had officially allowed the South Sudan military to use its territory but blamed individual officials for colluding with South Sudan.  It will spoil relations between us,  he said.  What the (Uganda) government needs to do is to crack down on those individuals.  Uganda deployed its military in South Sudan to back President Salva Kiir shortly after the war begun, in late 2013. Ugandan troops only withdrew after a regionally-brokered 2015 peace deal collapsed within months.  On Wednesday, Ugandan state-owned paper New Vision reported the country had beefed up security on its South Sudan border. Ugandan military spokesman Karemire denied the story.  ",

Senate Republicans also met and voted to keep Mitch McConnell of Kentucky as the majority leader. Schumer, 65, replaces the retiring Harry Reid of Nevada as the top Democrat in the Senate as the party prepares to deal with Republican Trump and Republican majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives. Schumer said Democrats had learned from the Nov. 8 election that they needed \u201ca sharper, bolder economic message about returning the economic system which so many feel is rigged against them to one that works for the people.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re ready to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Republicans, working with soon-to-be-President Trump on issues where we agree, but we will go toe-to-toe against the president-elect whenever our values or the progress we\u2019ve made is under assault,\u201d Schumer, who has been in the Senate since 1999, told reporters after the Democrats\u2019 closed-door election. In a move recognizing the influence of Sanders with many working-class voters, Schumer asked the independent senator from Vermont to be caucus head of outreach. Sanders, who lost the presidential primary to former senator and secretary of state Hillary Clinton, said his job was to reach out to \u201cgrassroots America.\u201d Another liberal, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was given the role of vice chair of the conference while yet another progressive voice, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, was made conference secretary. Senator Joe Manchin, a more conservative Democrat from West Virginia, was named vice chairman of the Democratic policy and communications committee.  Schumer said he knew there would be differences of opinion on the new team, but that together the group could \u201cspeak to the blue-collar worker in West Virginia, and Michigan, as well as the people who live along the coast.\u201d  Trump\u2019s economic populism helped him flip some once-reliably Democratic areas in blue-collar states while Democrats did better in large urban centers and coastal states. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois remained minority whip, the No. 2 spot, while Senator Patty Murray of Washington was chosen as assistant Democratic leader. In the House, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi announced she was running for minority leader again and said she already has the support of more than two-thirds of her caucus. Pelosi, who may face a challenger, agreed this week to delay leadership elections until Nov. 30 after her fellow Democrats called for more time to reassess why they fell short of their goals in the Nov. 8 election.

        "text": "RICHMOND, Virginia (Reuters) - In a case that could have an impact on the November presidential election, the Virginia Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday over a Republican lawsuit challenging the blanket restoration of voting rights for 206,000 felons by Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe. If upheld, McAuliffe\u2019s order could help tip Virginia, a swing state where the vote is traditionally close in presidential elections, in favor of presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Lawyers for leaders in the Republican-controlled state legislature argued that McAuliffe exceeded his authority by restoring voting rights en masse, rather than on a case-by-case basis. \u201cNever in Virginia\u2019s 240-year history has a governor exercised clemency power en masse,\u201d Charles Cooper, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told the court. Cooper said history and the language of the state constitution clearly indicate that the restoration of a felon\u2019s rights must be done individually. But Stuart Raphael, Virginia\u2019s solicitor general, said nothing in the constitution restricts McAuliffe\u2019s authority to restore such rights across the board, even though no governor has done so in the past. \u201cIf he has the power,\u201d Raphael said, \u201che has the power.\u201d The plaintiffs have asked the court to block McAuliffe\u2019s action, which also allows felons to serve on juries and hold public office. The court did not say on Tuesday when it may issue a decision in the case. Almost 12,000 felons have registered to vote since McAuliffe\u2019s April 22 executive action, the state elections board said. Many of the convicts benefiting from the order are African-Americans or Latinos, two groups that have voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates in the past. Democrat Barack Obama won Virginia in 2012 by about 150,000 votes and in 2008 by about 235,000 votes.  Before the order, felons had to petition the governor individually to restore their voting rights. Virginia is one of four states whose constitutions permanently disenfranchise felons but allow the governor to restore voting rights, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan civil liberties group. McAuliffe and other Democrats have said the restoration of rights to felons who have served their sentences and completed probation is long overdue. The McAuliffe administration has refused to release the names of felons whose rights have been restored, a decision that drew criticism on Tuesday from Justice William Mims. \u201cI cannot understand why a document of such importance has been shielded from litigants and the citizens of Virginia,\u201d he said.

A final decision on where Alexander Vinnik is extradited to now lies with the Greek justice minister, who steps in to resolve competing requests. Vinnik, the alleged mastermind of a $4 billion bitcoin laundering ring, is one of seven Russians arrested or indicted worldwide this year on U.S. cybercrime charges. U.S. authorities accuse him of running BTC-e   a digital currency exchange used to trade bitcoin   to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking since 2011. He denies the charges against him and says he was a technical consultant to BTC-e and not its operator. Since Vinnik s arrest in a village in northern Greece in July, Moscow has also requested he be returned home, as it has done before with other nationals wanted by the United States. Vinnik has agreed to be returned to Russia, where he is wanted on lesser fraud charges amounting to 10,000 euros, but he appealed to the Greek Supreme Court against a ruling that he be extradited to the United States. The Supreme Court rejected his appeal on Wednesday. Bitcoin was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and anonymous, making it difficult to subject them to conventional financial regulations. The price of bitcoin has soared this year and hit another all-time high on Tuesday, two days after the launch of the first bitcoin futures contract on a U.S. exchange. ",

Merkel had sharpened her rhetoric in the build-up to this month s German national vote and said on Sunday Turkey should not become a member. Ankara has accused her of indulging in populism.  The EU needs to take a step now. Either they will keep their promises and open the road for full membership... or come out and say they do not want to continue with Turkey,  President Tayyip Erdogan told a meeting of his ruling AK Party in Ankara. Erdogan said Turkey had not abandoned its strategic goal of EU membership. But he has long signaled that his country has run out of patience with the EU over its languishing accession bid, launched in 2005, and the impasse has been brought into focus by a sharp deterioration in Turkey s ties with Germany.  I am telling them: Come out and say this bravely and do what is necessary. Bravely,  Erdogan said.  Instead of this courage, there is a two-faced approach to halt the Turkey-EU full membership talks. This is politically unethical.   Germany s frustrations are focused on the detention of 11 German citizens, four of them with dual citizenship, in Turkey on political charges. Turkey accuses Germany of harboring plotters behind the 2016 coup attempt. Erdogan on Wednesday reiterated a call on Germany s voters of Turkish descent not to back  enemies  of Turkey, among whom he has previously named Merkel s Christian Democrats, the SDP and Greens.

        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker blasted Britain s failure to answer  huge numbers of questions  on its Brexit plans as negotiators held a new round of talks on Tuesday on a divorce due in less than two years. Hours after his chief negotiator Michel Barnier urged his British counterpart to  start negotiating seriously  when they met in Brussels on Monday, European Commission President Juncker echoed the bloc s refusal to discuss the future free trade deal London wants before penciling in terms for leaving the EU. Juncker scoffed at a raft of British negotiating papers published over the summer which Prime Minister Theresa May s government said had shown London was responding seriously to the detailed proposals agreed by the other 27 EU states.  I would like to be clear that I did read with the requisite attention all the papers produced by Her Majesty s government; I find none of them truly satisfactory,  he told European Union envoys gathered in Brussels for an annual conference.  So there are huge numbers of questions that need to be settled.  These included issues of rights for EU citizens in Britain and Britons in Europe after Brexit and the EU-UK border that will stretch across the island of Ireland, he said.   We need to be crystal clear that we will begin no negotiations on the new economic and trade relationship between the UK and the EU before all these questions are resolved ... that is the divorce between the EU and the UK,  Juncker said.  We cannot mix these issues up,  he continued. Barnier, he said, had firm instructions from the other 27 governments on the phasing of talks, even if he accepted that some issues could not be fully settled without knowing how trade will work.  First of all we settle the past before we look forward to the future,  he insisted. The head of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, joined Juncker in piling pressure on London:  The British government must come forward with clear positions in order for talks to advance,  he said in a statement on Tuesday evening. Negotiators who began two full days of talks on Tuesday morning are also trying to settle how much Britain may owe the Union on departure - a particularly explosive issue as both sides hope to reach some kind of outline divorce terms this year so as to give time to work out a transition to free trade. British negotiators, of whom over 100 were taking part in up to five separate forums at the EU headquarters, presented their legal assessment of an EU demand that Juncker has said might leave London paying Brussels some 60 billion euros ($72 billion) - a sum May s ministers have dismissed as unacceptable. Despite the EU rhetoric, which some in Britain see as ill-judged, government officials played down any tensions and described Monday s hour-long meeting between Barnier and Brexit Secretary David Davis as cordial and constructive.  May s spokeswoman said Britain feels it is in a good position in the negotiations and wants to agree with the European Union to move on to discussions about its future relationship by October, when EU leaders next hold a summit.  We believe we re in a good position and we would like to move on to discuss our future relationship,  May s spokeswoman told reporters.   We believe that we need the EU to show some more imagination and flexibility when it comes to these discussions,  she said.  We are seeking to agree by October Council that we can move to talk about our future relationship.  Davis is due back in Brussels late on Wednesday and to hold a final news conference with Barnier on Thursday to sum up the results of what is the third formal round of talks. ",

        "title": "Republicans Cruz, Kasich reach 'stop-Trump' deal",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican White House rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich announced a deal on Sunday to stay out of each other\u2019s way in some upcoming state primaries in hopes of blocking front-runner Donald Trump from winning the party\u2019s presidential nomination. Cruz\u2019s campaign said in a statement he would focus on the Indiana and give Kasich a clearer shot in Oregon and New Mexico, states where the Ohio governor expects to do well. Kasich, in turn, agreed to shift resources west and away from Indiana. The Indiana primary is on May 3, Oregon\u2019s is May 17 and New Mexico\u2019s June 7. Trump has won the most state nominating contests, but he has a tough path to earn the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination. The Cruz and Kasich campaigns believe their agreement to cede states where the other candidate appears strong could help limit Trump\u2019s ability to win more delegates. Some Republican strategists who oppose Trump have been calling for such a deal for weeks. The question for Cruz and Kasich is whether their agreement is too late. If no candidate has enough support by the first vote at the Republican National Convention in July, many delegates will be allowed to switch sides on subsequent ballots.  Cruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said Trump, who has offended women, Hispanics and other groups with controversial statements, would lose a general election contest against the eventual Democratic nominee in the Nov. 8 election. \u201cOur goal is to have an open convention in Cleveland, where we are confident a candidate capable of uniting the party and winning in November will emerge as the nominee,\u201d Kasich chief strategist John Weaver said in a statement. Late Sunday, Trump tweeted his reaction to the deal: \u201cWow, just announced that Lyin\u2019 Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!\u201d Trump has frequently complained that the Republican Party\u2019s nominating process is \u201crigged\u201d against him because establishment party members oppose him. Party officials argue that the delegate selection rules have been known for some time.  The stop-Trump group #NeverTrump welcomed news of the pact. \u201cWhether you support Ted Cruz or John Kasich, a second ballot at the Convention is imperative to stopping Donald Trump. We\u2019re happy to see the Kasich and Cruz campaigns strategically using their resources to deny Donald Trump delegates where they are in the strongest position to do so,\u201d said the group\u2019s senior adviser, Rory Cooper.

        "title": "Trump denies asking Comey to drop probe, decries 'witch hunt'",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, striking a defiant tone on Thursday after days of political tumult, denied asking former FBI Director James Comey to drop a probe into his former national security adviser and decried a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him.  Trump\u2019s terse denial followed reports by Reuters and other media about a memo written by Comey alleging that Trump made the request to close down the investigation into Michael Flynn and Russia in February. Trump fired Comey on May 9. \u201cNo. No. Next question,\u201d Trump told a news conference in the White House, when asked if he \u201cin any way, shape or form\u201d ever urged Comey to end the probe. Comey\u2019s dismissal last week set off a series of jarring developments that culminated on Wednesday in the Justice Department\u2019s appointment of a special counsel to probe possible ties between Russia and Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. They included media reports that Trump discussed sensitive intelligence on the Islamic State militant group with Russia\u2019s foreign minister.     In a pair of morning Twitter posts and at a later news conference, the Republican president described calls by some on the left for his impeachment as \u201cridiculous\u201d and said he had done nothing to warrant criminal charges. \u201cThe entire thing has been a witch hunt and there is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign - but I can always speak for myself - and the Russians. Zero,\u201d he told the news conference, standing alongside Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. In his earlier Twitter posts, Trump criticized the naming of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, an official he himself appointed. \u201cWith all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special counsel appointed!\u201d Trump wrote on Thursday morning.  He did not offer any evidence of such acts in his reference to former Democratic President Barack Obama and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \u201cThis is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!\u201d Trump tweeted. Democrats rejected Trump\u2019s characterization. \u201cThis is a truth hunt,\u201d said Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar. Russia has denied U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that it interfered in the election campaign to try to tilt the vote in Trump\u2019s favor. Trump has long bristled at the notion that Russia played any role in his November election victory over Clinton. Trump fired Flynn on Feb. 14 for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations last year with Russia\u2019s ambassador.  Reuters reported on Thursday that Flynn and other Trump campaign advisers were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails during the last seven months of the presidential race. U.S. stocks recovered ground on Thursday as upbeat economic data emboldened investors to return to the market, a day after Wall Street saw the biggest selloff in eight months on worries the political turmoil could undermine Trump initiatives such as tax cuts that investors see as favoring economic growth. Rosenstein, the No. 2 Justice Department official, named Mueller amid mounting pressure in Congress for an independent investigation beyond existing FBI and congressional probes into the Russia issue. Trump later told news anchors at the White House that Mueller\u2019s appointment was a \u201cvery, very negative thing,\u201d adding: \u201cI believe it hurts our country terribly, because it shows we\u2019re a divided, mixed-up, not-unified country.\u201d Rosenstein briefed senators on Thursday but made no public comments. One of the attendees, speaking on condition of anonymity, described Rosenstein as anxious and nervous and said he drank multiple glasses of water \u201cand spilled one.\u201d Afterward, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters that \u201ceverything he said was that you need to treat this investigation as if it may be a criminal investigation.\u201d A self-described friend of Comey\u2019s wrote in a public blog post on Thursday that Comey had told him that he had rebuffed a Trump request for loyalty by promising only honesty. \u201cHe also told me that Trump was perceptibly uncomfortable with this answer,\u201d wrote Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a critic of Trump.  \u201cAnd he said that ever since, the President had been trying to be chummy in a fashion that Comey felt was designed to absorb him into Trump\u2019s world - to make him part of the team.\u201d Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill said Rosenstein told senators that he knew Comey would be fired before he wrote his letter accusing him of missteps as FBI director, including his handling of an election-year probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. The White House initially said last week that Trump was prompted to fire Comey after reading the Rosenstein letter. Trump later said he had already decided to dismiss him and was thinking of \u201cthis Russia thing.\u201d The New York Times reported on Thursday that Trump called Comey weeks after he took office on Jan. 20 and asked him when federal authorities were going to say Trump was not under investigation. It cited two people briefed on the call.   Comey told Trump he should not contact him directly about FBI investigations but follow procedure and have the White House counsel ask the Justice Department, which oversees the FBI, the Times reported. A key issue Mueller may have to tackle is whether Trump has committed obstruction of justice, an offense that could be used in any effort in the Republican-led Congress to impeach him and remove him from office.  Asked about possible obstruction of justice, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters the special counsel would \u201cfollow the facts where ever they may lead\u201d and that \u201cit is premature to prejudge anything at this point.\u201d ",

        "title": "For some Democrats, it's voting for Clinton - and keeping it quiet",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - One would expect voters from the heavily Democratic Brooklyn neighborhood of Cobble Hill to pick presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 general election. Just don\u2019t expect them to advertise it. Like lawns and windowsills in liberal pockets across the country, much of the neighborhood is bereft of pro-Clinton signage in the final weeks before the election. It\u2019s a stark contrast to the 2012 and 2008 campaigns, when President Barack Obama whipped up a frenzy of support from Democrats and his signature \u201cHope\u201d and \u201cForward\u201d signs were ubiquitous.  The scarcity of lawn and window signs is an indication of the Democratic nominee\u2019s struggle to generate enthusiasm among left-leaning voters, a challenge that\u2019s borne out in polling data, and could potentially haunt her if voters fail to turn out on election day. Clinton leads Republican challenger Donald Trump by four percentage points among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Friday.  But Americans of all political stripes have been more critical of Clinton than they were of Obama when he was running for his second term four years ago, according to the daily tracking poll.  Among Democrats, 78 percent say they have a favorable view of Clinton, lower than the 89 percent favorability rating Obama had at this point in the race in 2012. Clinton\u2019s favorability drops to 28 percent among independents versus Obama\u2019s 47 percent. Nancy Kimmel Viola, a 63-year-old social worker who lives about a mile away from Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, keeps a \u201cBernie 2016\u201d sticker taped to the front door of her Carroll Gardens home, a vestige of her support for the unsuccessful bid of Sen. Bernie Sanders. While she plans to vote for Clinton, she confesses that her \u201cheart\u2019s not in it.\u201d \u201cI have to vote for her.\u201d Viola said. \u201cHaving Trump in there is too scary.\u201d In Denver, residents in the Democratic stronghold of Park Hill posted many yard signs over a local zoning issue, but few for the presidential race. \u201cMost of us around here will vote Democratic, we always do, but we\u2019re not overly enthusiastic for Clinton,\u201d said resident Pablo Marron. \u201cBut we are united in our opposition to Trump.\u201d In the heavily Democratic Denver suburb of Northglenn, banners for local office-seekers littered a major roadway, but there were no accompanying Clinton signs. In the affluent liberal Washington DC suburb of Chevy Chase, Maryland, signs for the Democratic nominee appeared only roughly once every 10 blocks. The lack of enthusiasm isn\u2019t just hitting the Clinton campaign. Americans from both major parties say they are generally less interested in voting this year than they were in 2012, according to the Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, which compared results gathered during the first 20 days of September with the same period of 2012. The Clinton campaign did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Clinton\u2019s online store displayed roughly a dozen different signs and banners for sale, ranging from an 11-inch by 17-inch sign, sold at $10 for a pack of two, to a four-foot by six-foot \u201cHillary for America\u201d banner, which retailed for $100. Sales data was not immediately available and a request for comment from the store went unanswered. For some, there is a \u201chold your nose quality\u201d to this election, said Matthew Dallek, associate professor at George Washington University\u2019s Graduate School of Political Management. \u201cThe lack of signage\u201d in liberal enclaves may indicate, Dallek said, \u201cthat there just isn\u2019t this sort of enthusiasm that existed for Obama.\u201d But there are some blocks that buck the trend. On a street in Gowanus, Brooklyn, no fewer than four homes bore pro-Clinton signage, including a life-size cutout of the Democratic nominee, which rests in the windowsill of retired lawyer Chris Morrison\u2019s home. The beaming cardboard Clinton prompts many passersby to take pictures, said Morrison, a staunch Clinton supporter. \u201cYou don\u2019t see as much signage this time around. In this neighborhood I don\u2019t get so concerned (because everyone is) more or less on the same page,\u201d said Morrison, 66. \u201cI worry when I go to some other places.\u201d ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers investigating fired national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s security clearance said Monday they could not find the hotel Flynn said he stayed at during a 2015 trip to Saudi Arabia or any record of a conference he reported attending. In a letter to companies for which Flynn worked, U.S. Representatives Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel requested documents related to Flynn\u2019s work in Saudi Arabia, Russia and other countries. They said Flynn had not accurately reported his foreign travels and contacts in a 2016 application to renew his security clearance. Cummings is the ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives\u2019 Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Engel is the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Flynn\u2019s work for foreign interests has taken center stage in a broad federal investigation into the ties between President Donald Trump\u2019s associates and Russia and other countries during and after the 2016 election. While Flynn disclosed an October 2015 trip to Saudi Arabia, Cummings and Engel said Flynn omitted key details and said they could not identify any conference he may have attended or find the hotel he reported staying at during the trip.

        "title": "Message from North Korean missile over Japan 'loud and clear': Trump",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - President Donald Trump warned on Tuesday that all options are on the table for the United States to respond to North Korea s firing of a ballistic missile over northern Japan s Hokkaido island into the sea in a new show of force. The missile test further increased tension in east Asia as U.S. and South Korean forces conducted annual military exercises on the Korean peninsula, angering Pyongyang which sees the war games as a preparation for invasion. North Korea has conducted dozens of ballistic missile tests under its leader, Kim Jong Un, in defiance of U.N. sanctions, but firing projectiles over mainland Japan is rare. Trump, who has vowed not to let North Korea develop nuclear missiles that can hit the mainland United States, said the world had received North Korea s latest message  loud and clear .  Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table,  Trump said in a statement. Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spoke and agreed that North Korea  poses a grave and growing direct threat  to the United States, Japan and South Korea, the White House said. Investors flocked to safe-haven assets after the missile firing. The dollar fell to its lowest in more than 2-1/2 years against a basket of major currencies .DXY but then rebounded, while benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR yields fell and the price of gold XAU= hit more than a nine-month peak. U.S. stocks .SPX recovered from a sharply lower open.  Initial assessment indicates the North Korean missile was an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), the Pentagon said in a statement. Two U.S. officials said it appeared to be a KN-17, or Hwasong-12. North Korea s Kim guided a launch of its Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile on Tuesday in a drill to counter the joint exercises by South Korean and U.S. militaries, the North s official KCNA news agency said on Wednesday.  The current ballistic rocket launching drill like a real war is the first step of the military operation of the KPA in the Pacific and a meaningful prelude to containing Guam,  KCNA quoted Kim as saying. Pentagon spokesman Colonel Robert Manning said diplomacy was still Washington s preferred option with Pyongyang. North Korea was defiant.  The U.S. should know that it can neither browbeat the DPRK with any economic sanctions and military threats and blackmail nor make the DPRK flinch from the road chosen by itself,  North Korea s official Rodong Sinmun said, using the initials of the North s official name, the Democratic People s Republic of Korea. The North vows to never give up its weapons programs, saying they are necessary to counter hostility from the United States and its allies. The United States has said before that all options, including military, are on the table, although its preference is for a diplomatic solution. The United States is technically still at war with the North because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Relations worsened last year when North Korea staged two nuclear bomb tests. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the launch was  absolutely unacceptable and irresponsible  and that the Security Council now needed to take serious action. Saying  enough is enough,  Haley said she hoped China and Russia would continue to work with the rest of the Security Council when it meets on Tuesday afternoon to discuss what more can be done about North Korea s nuclear and missile programs. The Security Council earlier this month unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea after it staged two long-range missile launches in July.          In response to Trump s statement that all options are on the table, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters:  It s troubling, because tensions are high and whose nerves are stronger, we don t know.  A U.S. official denied a report by Japan s Nikkei newspaper that the United States and Japan will call at Tuesday s meeting for an international embargo on oil exports to North Korea. Securing diplomatic agreement to such a ban would likely be extraordinarily difficult. Diplomats say China and Russia typically only view a test of a long-range missile or a nuclear weapon as a trigger for further possible U.N. sanctions. Negotiations on the past three substantial U.N. sanctions resolutions have taken between one and three months. The United States has proposed that the Security Council adopt a statement on Tuesday condemning North Korea s ballistic missile launch and imploring  all states to strictly, fully, and expeditiously implement  U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang, according to a copy of the draft statement seen by Reuters.  The draft statement does not threaten new Security Council action against North Korea. In China, North Korea s lone major ally, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the crisis was  approaching a critical juncture , but it might also be a turning point to open the door to peace talks. The launch was North Korea s second since U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to make a peace overture last week, by welcoming what he called the restraint Pyongyang had shown by not conducting tests for several weeks. Trump also expressed optimism last week about a possible improvement in relations, saying of North Korea s Kim:  I respect the fact that he is starting to respect us.     Some experts in Asia said Kim was trying to pressure Washington to get to the negotiating table with the latest missile tests.  (North Korea) thinks that by exhibiting their capability, the path to dialogue will open,  said Masao Okonogi, professor emeritus at Japan s Keio University. HIGH-FLYING MISSILESouth Korea s military said the missile was launched from near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, just before 6 a.m. (2100 GMT on Monday) and flew 2,700 km (1,680 miles), reaching an altitude of about 550 km (340 miles). Four South Korean fighter jets bombed a military firing range on Tuesday after President Moon Jae-in asked the military to demonstrate capabilities to counter North Korea. South Korea and the United States had discussed deploying additional  strategic assets  on the Korean peninsula, South Korea s presidential Blue House said in a statement, without giving more details. Earlier this month, North Korea threatened to fire four missiles into the sea near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam after Trump said it would face  fire and fury  if it threatened the United States. North Korea fired what it said was a rocket carrying a communications satellite into orbit over Japan in 2009 after warning of its plan. The United States, Japan and South Korea considered it a ballistic missile test. The latest missile fell into the sea 1,180 km (735 miles) east of Hokkaido, the Japanese government said. In many northern Japanese towns, sirens wailed and loudspeakers urged residents to take precautions, sending some scrambling to leave their houses while others confessed they had no idea what they should do.

        "title": "EU MPs threaten Cambodia aid and trade over crackdown",
        "text": "PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A European Parliament delegation warned on Tuesday that Cambodia could face EU action over aid and vital trade preferences if the human rights situation worsened further. The delegation s statement was the strongest threat of action from representatives of any Western donors since the arrest of opposition leader Kem Sokha in September and steps by Prime Minister Hun Sen s government to dissolve his Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). The ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Delegation of the European Parliament called for the release of Kem Sokha and an end to the process of dissolving his party.          The government of Cambodia should be aware that the European Parliament is a co-legislator for budgetary and trade issues,  said the delegation s chairman, Werner Langen, a member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats party.  A serious deterioration of the human rights situation might have implications for development assistance programs and trade preferences,  he said after a two-day visit. Huy Vannak, undersecretary of state at Cambodia s Interior Ministry, said the European Parliament should keep trade and politics separate.  Some members of the European Parliament should distinguish between political agenda and trade for the interests of the people. We need to create many choices rather than make the interests of the people a hostage of a political agenda,  Huy Vannak told Reuters.  Without economic prosperity, democracy will just be an illusion,  he said. European Union countries accounted for around 40 percent of Cambodia s exports in 2016. Its exports, mostly of clothing, get fully duty free access under a scheme to help the world s poorest countries. Western diplomats say in private it would be difficult to secure EU agreement for limiting trade preferences because of the harm it could do to some 700,000 low-wage garment workers employed in Cambodian factories. The European Union and its member states also gave Cambodia nearly $170 million in development aid last year, according to Cambodian government figures. That was still well short of the $265 million it got from China, which is now by far the biggest donor and investor and voiced support for Hun Sen s government after the arrest of Kem Sokha. The government has intensified a crackdown against political opponents, independent media and human rights groups in recent months ahead of an election next July in which Hun Sen s rule of more than 32 years will be at stake. Cambodia s Supreme Court rejected an appeal to free Kem Sokha on Tuesday, saying his release could be a public risk as the threat of dissolution looms over his party. Lawyers for Kem Sokha had asked the Supreme Court to rule that his detention was illegal and said he should be granted parliamentary immunity from prosecution. The Supreme Court is due to rule on Nov. 16 whether to dissolve the CNRP after the government last month filed a lawsuit asking to dissolve it on grounds it was involved in a plot to topple the government. Kem Sokha was not brought to the court hearing on Tuesday.  The hearing seems fake,  Hem Socheat, a lawyer for Kem Sokha, told the court.

Typhoon Lan was classified as an intense Category 4 storm on Saturday, with winds of up to 250 km/h (156 mph), according to the Tropical Storm Risk web site. By midday, it was south of South Borodino Island, east of Okinawa, and moving northeast at 15 kph, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s Liberal Democratic Party-led (LDP) coalition is on track to roughly match the two-thirds  super majority  it held in parliament s lower house before dissolution, helped by divisions in the opposition camp and jitters over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs, media forecasts have said.

        "title": "France's National Front on verge of split after election setback",
        "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Four months after a heavy electoral defeat, France s National Front is on the verge of a split between its leader and her chief deputy that could open the way to a policy change on the euro as the far-right party seeks to rebrand itself.   Marine Le Pen s relationship with Florian Philippot, for years her closest aide, has become so strained since she lost the presidential election to centrist Emmanuel Macron that far-right experts say it has reached the point of no-return. A rupture would mark an important change for the FN and Le Pen because she has for years defended Philippot s anti-euro, protectionist line against critics in the party, and built her 2012 and 2017 presidential campaigns on his advice. Philippot has been under fire in the party over its setbacks in this year s presidential and parliamentary elections, with many blaming the anti-euro line he has backed so strongly.  Le Pen, whose leadership is also under scrutiny, has increasingly distanced herself from Philippot, focusing on the party s anti-immigration, identitarian roots in speeches rather than the party s stance on the euro. Philippot has stood firm, maintaining that opposing the euro is a vote winner.  Le Pen has now issued him an ultimatum, saying he must decide between his party role and a think-tank group known as the Patriots that he has set up focused on an anti-euro policy.   I don t intend to abandon the Patriots nor my convictions nor my ideals,  a visibly shaken Philippot said in an interview on CNews.  If they want to get rid of me and prevent me from working on the relaunch of the National Front, then let it be done,  he added. Minutes later Le Pen issued a terse statement saying she had decide to revoke his responsibilities for strategy and communications, but stopped short of firing him as vice president - for now. Jerome Fourquet, a specialist on the far-right at pollster Ifop, sees the split as definitive.   This seems to have escalated to a point of no-return,  he said. If Philippot leaves the party or is forced out, it could at first cause further turmoil for the far-right as it struggles to portray itself as the main opposition to Macron, despite having reached the second round of the presidential election in May. In the presidential run-off, Le Pen secured 34 percent of the vote against 66 percent for Macron   its strongest election performance but still a disappointment. In June s parliamentary election, the national Front won only eight seats.   The role of chief opponent has been assumed by Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the far-left France Insoumise (France Unbowed), who together with unions is leading calls for mass protests against reforms planned by Macron. The departure of Philippot, a graduate of France s top ENA administrative school, could be followed by others in the party with a similar profile walking out, depriving the party of figures who were key to policy-making. Le Pen and her party might, however, see long-term gains as his exit could enable her to reassert her authority and make it easier to shift policy on the euro. This might in turn help the FN forge alliances with other right-wing politicians.   If Philippot was to leave there would be a negative buzz, there would be turmoil in the FN, but after a while that would likely be digested and overcome,  Fourquet said. He underlined that the party had survived previous crises, such as the departure in the late 1990s of Bruno Megret, once a political star who took allies with him. Analysts say Philippot has fewer loyal allies and a smaller political capital than Megret did at the time and would therefore be unlikely to create a rival party that would pose a serious threat to the FN.              The deadline for the FN to decide how it wants to rebrand itself is March, when it will hold a party congress to decide on a new name and what its strategies and policies should be for the next presidential election due in 2022.         Jean Messiha, who coordinated Le Pen s presidential manifesto, said the party was in a difficult phase where it was adapting to France s changed political landscape.  We need to get our act together and, most importantly, we need Marine Le Pen to reaffirm, to reassert her authority,  he told Reuters. Le Pen s partner, senior FN official Louis Aliot, made a similar point, telling supporters at the weekend not to give in to  defeatism .  In politics, you re never dead,  he said. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Officials in Florida and Virginia filed voter fraud charges against three people in apparently unrelated cases on Friday, just 11 days before American voters cast ballots in the hotly contested presidential race. The charges targeted a Florida woman and a Virginia man accused of filing bogus voter registration forms and a Florida woman \talleged to have tampered with absentee ballots she was opening at the Miami-Dade Elections Department. In the Iowa capital of Des Moines, county election officials referred three cases of suspected voter fraud to police earlier this week, leading to one arrest on Thursday, police said. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has charged in recent weeks that the election will be rigged in favor of Democrat Hillary Clinton, though he has shown no proof for these claims and many Republicans have called them unfounded. Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle in Florida said that 74-year-old Gladys Coego had been working as an absentee ballot opener when a supervisor allegedly saw her changing ballots that had been left blank to support a mayoral candidate. Prosecutors said that Coego admitted to marking the ballots and was charged with two felony counts of marking or designating the ballot of another. \u201cThe integrity of the electoral process is intact because our procedures work,\u201d said Christina White, the county\u2019s election supervisor, in a statement. Tomika Curgil, 33, was charged with five felony counts of submitting false voter registration information for allegedly handing in forms filled out by fictitious voters while working on a voter-registration drive for a medical marijuana advocacy group. A Virginia man was also charged with submitting falsified forms while working for a voter-registration campaign, state prosecutors said. Vafalay Massaquoi, 30, was arraigned on two felony counts of forging a public record and two counts of voter registration fraud. \u201cThere is no allegation that any illegal vote was actually cast in this case,\u201d said Virginia Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Bryan Porter. \u201cFurthermore, since the fraudulent applications involved fictitious people, had the fraud not been uncovered, the risk of actual fraudulent votes being cast was low.\u201d Neither Coego, Curgil nor Massaquoi could be reached for immediate comment. Police in Des Moines on Thursday arrested a woman who was accused of voting twice - casting early-voting ballots at two locations - in one of three cases of suspected voter fraud reported by the Polk County Auditor\u2019s Office. Police did not disclose the political affiliation of the woman, identified as Terri Lynn Rote, 55, but the Des Moines Register newspaper reported she was a registered Republican. A man in Texas, where early voting started on Monday, was arrested on Monday on charges of electioneering and loitering near a polling place, public records show.  The man, Brett Mauthe, had been charged for showing up to vote in a Trump hat and T-shirt with the phrase \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d a reference to a comment Clinton made disparaging her rivals\u2019 supporters, election officials told media.

        "title": "Exclusive: U.S. warship sails near islands Beijing claims in South China Sea - U.S. officials",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Navy destroyer sailed near islands claimed by China in the South China Sea on Tuesday, three U.S. officials told Reuters, prompting anger in Beijing, even as President Donald Trump s administration seeks Chinese cooperation in reining in North Korea s missile and nuclear programs. The operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters. But it was not as provocative as previous ones carried out since Trump took office in January. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Chafee, a guided-missile destroyer, carried out normal maneuvering operations that challenged  excessive maritime claims  near the Paracel Islands, among a string of islets, reefs and shoals over which China has territorial disputes with its neighbors. China s Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that a warship, two fighter jets and a helicopter had scrambled to warn the U.S. ship away, adding it had infringed upon China s sovereignty and security with its  provocation . China would further strengthen its naval and air defenses, the ministry said.  We demand the U.S. side earnestly take steps to correct its mistakes,  it added. Speaking earlier at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China had lodged  stern representations  with the United States, and reiterated that the Paracels were Chinese territory.  China will continue to take resolute measures to protect Chinese sovereign territory and maritime interests. China urges the U.S. to conscientiously respect China s sovereign territory and security interests, conscientiously respect the efforts regional countries have made to protect peace and stability in the South China Sea, and stop these wrong actions.  Next month, Trump makes his first visit to Asia as president, including a stop in China, which he has been pressuring to do more to rein in North Korea. China is North Korea s neighbor and biggest trading partner. Unlike in August, when a U.S. Navy destroyer came within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built up by China in the South China Sea, officials said the destroyer on Tuesday sailed close to but not within that range of the islands. Twelve nautical miles mark internationally recognized territorial limits. Sailing within that range is meant to show the United States does not recognize territorial claims. The Pentagon did not comment directly on the operation, but said the United States carried out regular freedom-of-navigation operations and would continue to do so. China s claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in shipborne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Experts and some U.S. officials have criticized former president Barack Obama for potentially reinforcing China s claims by sticking to innocent passage, in which a warship effectively recognized a territorial sea by crossing it speedily without stopping. The U.S. military has a long-standing position that its operations are carried out throughout the world, including in areas claimed by allies, and that they are separate from political considerations. The United States has said it would like to see more international participation in freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea. Trump s trip to Asia will likely be dominated by the North Korean nuclear threat. He will also visit South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines. In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, all in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. Trump s visit to China will reciprocate a trip to the United States made in April by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The U.S. president s attempts to get Chinese help with North Korea have met with limited success so far, but he has gone out of his way to thank Xi for his efforts. ",

        "title": "INTERNET: Living with the Great Firewall of China",
        "text": "(Reuters) - The  Great Firewall of China    the world s most extensive effort to try to control cyberspace   has become more formidable under President Xi Jinping.  Authorities have closed some video and audio streaming websites, limited online access to foreign and  foreign-inspired  television programs, stiffened penalties for  spreading rumor  via social media and restricted access to virtual private networks.  For the very wired  Class of 2012 , these measures are largely minor inconveniences. Some buy into the idea that the Internet needs to be closely managed. Others just find workarounds.  Here are their views on living with the Great Firewall.  Wang Siyue, a product specialist at an Internet education company:  \"I'm sure these restrictions will exist in the short term, but over the long term they can't block the development of this industry domestically. I believe there will be even more internet companies and startup opportunities.\"  Zhang Weixuan, an assistant secretary at a software company:   For contemporary youth in China right now, our channels for information are broad, including the use of VPNs, or a variety of means through which we can be exposed to foreign news.    For me (blocking VPNs) won t have a great impact. Maybe for second- and third-tier cities, or for those young people who have never had the experience of going abroad, or whose English is not very good, they may be subject to the impact of the country s more stringent controls over propaganda.   Fu Shiwei, an assistant university teacher:   My students are very tech savvy so they help me solve things like looking up academic information or stay updated on global current affairs. I think it s okay. The government keeps everyone in line, so I don t have any strong opinions about the government.   Zuo Aining, a senior credit risk associate, based in Washington, D.C.:   I personally think that for the Internet, as a very open platform, certain strategies for oversight are very necessary ... what I m concerned about are things like terrorist attacks.    Maybe if you make better use of systems to supervise the Internet you ll have a more positive impact in terms of protecting national security.   Qin Lijuan, a senior wealth management consultant:   If I want some news I usually just ask friends abroad. I ve got a lot of classmates who are abroad, who studied there or are working there.

        "title": "Kurdish leader Barzani resigns after independence vote backfires",
        "text": "ERBIL/BAGHDAD Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani said he would give up his position as president on Nov. 1, after an independence referendum he championed backfired and triggered a regional crisis.  There was high drama at the Kurdish parliament, which was stormed by armed protesters as it met to approve the veteran leader s resignation as Kurdish president. Some MPs were barricaded in their offices on Sunday evening.     In a televised address, his first since Iraqi forces launched a surprise offensive to recapture Kurdish-held territory on Oct. 16, Barzani confirmed that he would not extend his presidential term after Nov. 1  under any conditions .  I am the same Masoud Barzani, I am a Peshmerga (Kurdish fighter) and will continue to help my people in their struggle for independence,  said Barzani, who has campaigned for Kurdish self-determination for nearly four decades.  The address followed a letter he sent to parliament in which he asked members to take measures to fill the resulting power vacuum. The region s parliament met in the Kurdish capital Erbil on Sunday to discuss the letter. A majority of 70 Kurdish MPs voted to accept Barzani s request and 23 opposed it, Kurdish TV channels Rudaw and Kurdistan 24 said.  Demonstrators, some carrying clubs and guns, stormed the parliament building as the session was in progress. Gunshots were heard. Some protesters outside the building said they wanted to  punish  MPs who they said had  insulted  Barzani. Some attacked journalists at the scene. A Kurdish official had told Reuters on Saturday that Barzani had decided to hand over the presidency without waiting for elections that had been set for Nov. 1 but which have now been delayed by eight months. The region, which had enjoyed unprecedented autonomy for years, has been in turmoil since the independence referendum a month ago prompted military and economic retaliation from Iraq s central government in Baghdad. In his address, Barzani vigorously defended his decision to hold the Sept. 25 referendum, the results of which  can never be erased , he said. The vote was overwhelmingly for independence and triggered the military action by the Baghdad government and threats from neighboring Turkey and Iran.  He added that the Iraqi attack on Kirkuk and other Kurdish held territory vindicated his position that Baghdad no longer believed in federalism and instead wanted to curtail Kurdish rights.  Barzani condemned the United States for failing to back the Kurds.  We tried to stop bloodshed but the Iraqi forces and Popular Mobilization Front (Shi ite militias) kept advancing, using U.S. weapons,  he said.   Our people should now question, whether the U.S. was aware of Iraq s attack and why they did not prevent it.  Asked for reaction to Barzani s resignation, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said:  I would refer you to Kurdistan officials for information on President Barzani. Also, we are not going to get into any private diplomatic discussions.  Barzani has been criticized by Kurdish opponents for the loss of the city of Kirkuk, oil-rich and considered by many Kurds to be their spiritual home. His resignation could help facilitate a reconciliation between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and Iraq s central government, whose retaliatory measures since the referendum have transformed the balance of power in the north.  Barzani has led the KRG since it was established in 2005. His second term expired in 2013 but was extended without elections being held as Islamic State militants swept across vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria.     U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State but the alliance has faltered since the militants were largely defeated in the country.  After the Kurdish vote, Iraqi troops were ordered by the country s prime minister Haider al-Abadi to take control of areas claimed by both Baghdad and the KRG.  Abadi also wants to take control of the border crossings between the Kurdish region and Turkey, Iran and Syria, including one through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil. The fall of Kirkuk - a multi-ethnic city which lies outside the KRG s official boundaries - to Iraqi forces on Oct. 16 was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurds  independence drive because it halved the region s oil export revenue. Iraqi forces and the Peshmerga started a second round of talks on Sunday to resolve a conflict over control of the Kurdistan region s border crossings, Iraqi state TV said.  A first round was held on Friday and Saturday, with Abadi ordering a 24-hour suspension on Friday of military operations against Kurdish forces. He demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks, saying in a statement:  We won t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution.

        "title": "Xi says China will continue to open its economy, deepen financial reforms",
        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China will deepen economic and financial reforms and further open its markets to foreign investors as it looks to move from high-speed to high-quality growth, President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday. China will push ahead with market-oriented reforms of its foreign exchange rate as well as its financial system, and let the market play a decisive role in the allocation of resources, Xi said at the opening of a key, twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress.   China s open door will not be closed, it will be only be opened wider,  Xi said. The government will  clean up rules and practices that hinder a unified market and fair competition, support development of private firms and stimulate vitality of all types of market entities,  Xi said, while pledging to further open China s services sector to foreign investors.   However, while expressing support for market reform and private firms, Xi also called for stronger, bigger state firms.  The government will  promote strengthening, improvement and expansion of state capital, (and) effectively prevent loss of state assets, deepen reform of state-owned enterprises, development a mixed-ownership economy and cultivate globally competitive world-class firms,  Xi said.  Xi s comments reiterated a long-standing pledge by party leaders to give a greater role to free-market forces to improve efficiency and put the economy on a more sustainable growth path. But as Xi gears up for his second five-year term, foreign business executives and analysts increasingly believe market liberalization is seen as secondary to his state-centered approach to economic policy and his focus on stability. Other painful reforms that many economists say are needed have also moved slowly under Xi. They include overhauling China s bloated and debt-laden state sector, fixing the fiscal system to tackle local government debt and bringing in new property taxes to ward off housing bubbles. China should also strengthen consumption as a foundation for economic development, Xi said, and will expand the middle class and narrow the gap in development between rural and urban areas. Beijing s campaign to rein in high debt levels and industrial overcapacity will continue as part of supply-side structural reforms, he added.      Xi also proposed a goal of developing China into a  basically  modernized, innovation-driven country by 2035 and a modern  strong power  by 2050. But analysts said that suggests the government is likely to continue to target moderately high economic growth in coming years, which could see the country s large debt pile climb even further.  China s gross domestic income per capita would need to rise by an average of 6.6 percent a year in real U.S. dollar terms from 2017 onwards to become an  innovative economy  and match the development level of today s South Korea by 2035, ANZ estimated. That growth figure needs to be no lower than 4.9 percent for China to be a  modernized economy  - the by World Bank s definition of high income countries - all the way to 2050, ANZ added.  Nobody knows what is a  modernized country , but from the wording of Xi Jinping you can tell what he would like to achieve is for China to be one of the high income countries today like Japan and Australia,  said Raymond Yeung, Great China Chief Economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.  China is expected to post its strongest economic growth in several years this year, riding on a government-led construction boom, but economists said it is still relying too heavily on credit-fueled stimulus despite policymakers  vows to reduce debt risks. Some international agencies and economists have argued Beijing should abandon its arbitrary annual growth targets or lower it to become less reliant on government stimulus and bank credit. Less ambitious growth targets would also give policymakers more room for tougher reforms.  Specific economic targets for 2018 are likely to be set during an economic work meeting later this year, but are not expected to be announced until March.     The International Monetary Fund warned this year that China s credit growth was on a  dangerous trajectory  and called for  decisive action , while the Bank for International Settlements said in late 2016 that excessive debt growth was signaling a banking crisis in the next three years.

High Commissioner for Human Rights, was addressing a special session of the Human Rights Council which later adopted a resolution condemning  the very likely commission of crimes against humanity  by security forces and others against Rohingya. Myanmar s ambassador Htin Lynn said his government  dissociated  itself from the text and denounced what he called  politicisation and partiality . Zeid, who has described the campaign in the past as a  textbook case of ethnic cleansing , said that none of the 626,000 Rohingya who have fled violence to Bangladesh since August should be repatriated to Myanmar unless there was robust monitoring on the ground. He described reports of  acts of appalling barbarity committed against the Rohingya, including deliberately burning people to death inside their homes, murders of children and adults; indiscriminate shooting of fleeing civilians; widespread rapes of women and girls, and the burning and destruction of houses, schools, markets and mosques .  Can anyone - can anyone - rule out that elements of genocide may be present?  he told the 47-member state forum. Shahriar Alam, Bangladesh s junior foreign affairs minister, told the session in Geneva that his country was hosting nearly one million  Myanmar nationals  following executions and rapes. These crimes had been  perpetrated by Myanmar security forces and extremist Buddhist vigilantes , Alam said, calling for an end to what he called  xenophobic rhetoric..including from higher echelons of the government and the military . Mainly Buddhist Myanmar denies the Muslim Rohingya are its citizens and considers them foreigners.  China s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang on Wednesday told a regular news briefing that the resolution would not resolve or alleviate the situation.  It could further complicate the issue and have a negative impact on Myanmar and Bangladesh implementing the repatriation agreement,  he said. China has supported Myanmar in the face of international criticism and has taken an increasingly active role in the issue, with foreign minister Wang Yi recently proposing a three step resolution during a visit to Myanmar. But Nicholas Bequelin, East Asia director at Amnesty International, said in a statement that by voting against the resolution China has proved itself  woefully out of step  with world opinion and is serving to  preserve impunity for horrific crimes . Marzuki Darusman, head of an independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar, said by video from Malaysia that his team has interviewed Rohingya refugees, including children in the Bangladeshi port city of Cox s Bazar, who recounted  acts of extreme brutality  and  displayed signs of severe trauma . Myanmar has not granted the investigators access to Rakhine, the northern state from which the Rohingya have fled, Darusman said.  We maintain hope that it will be granted early in 2018.  Pramila Patten, special envoy of the U.N. Secretary-General on sexual violence in conflict, who interviewed survivors in Bangladesh in November, said she had heard accounts of  rape, gang rape by multiple soldiers, forced public nudity and humiliation, and sexual slavery in military captivity . Myanmar denies committing atrocities against the Rohingya. Its envoy Htin said:  People will say what they wanted to believe and sometimes they will say what they were told to say.  ",

        "title": "Special Report: Why Obama and other gun control advocates own stock in firearms makers",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Barack Obama might seem an unlikely investor in the firearms industry. But the U.S. president, a fierce advocate for gun regulation, has money in a pension fund that holds stock in gun and ammunition companies. Although Obama\u2019s stake is minuscule, worth no more than $30, it reflects a much larger surge of investment. The president is among millions of Americans buying into gun companies - often unwittingly - as mutual funds have increased such holdings to record levels, according to a Reuters analysis of institutional investment in firearms companies. Since Obama was elected in 2009, mutual funds have raised their stakes to about $510 million from $30 million in the nation\u2019s two largest gun manufacturers with publicly traded shares, Smith & Wesson Corp SWHC.O and Sturm, Ruger & Co (RGR.N). That means such stocks are now common in retirement and college savings plans.  The influx has helped to boost both companies\u2019 shares by more than 750 percent during the Obama presidency; each now has a market value of about $1 billion. Beyond mutual funds, such investments also are held in the portfolios of hedge funds and public pension plans, which are harder to track. The White House declined to comment on Obama\u2019s holdings in the Illinois General Assembly\u2019s pension plan, which he earned while serving in that state\u2019s senate. The president has disclosed between $50,000 and $100,000 in the plan.  Other indirect investors in firearms companies include advocates for gun regulation in the U.S. Congress and several parents of children who attended Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut - site of the 2012 massacre of 20 students and six staff members.  Fund managers are drawn to the stocks by surging sales. Buyers are arming themselves, analysts said, in response to mass shootings and calls for tougher gun laws. By the end of 2015, more than 150 mutual funds owned Smith & Wesson shares, up from 53 at the end of 2008, and nearly 130 held stock in Ruger, up from 52, according to data from Morningstar Inc. It would have taken investors \u201cminimal due diligence\u201d to see massive profit potential in Ruger stock when Obama was first elected, said Ruger Chief Executive Mike Fifer. Shares hit a low of $4.50 the Friday after that Tuesday election; the stock was changing hands today at $61.61. \u201cOrders at every level of the distribution channel exploded\u201d the week of Obama\u2019s election, Fifer recalled. \u201cAnd continued to do so for months afterward.\u201d America\u2019s leading ammunition maker, Vista Outdoor Inc (VSTO.N), has drawn investments from 319 funds in its first year of public trading and now has a market value of $2.9 billion. Its bonds are owned by a who\u2019s-who of U.S. investment and insurance companies. (For a graphic of top mutual fund investors in the leading gun and ammo stocks, see tmsnrt.rs/1TlCwBz )     Such investments can be hard to identify within large funds, even with concerted effort. Eric Milgram, a corporate research analyst whose two children were at Sandy Hook Elementary during the rampage, tried to purge his portfolio of firearms holdings. But he gave up after a frustrating search through mutual fund stock lists, holding companies and subsidiaries. \u201cI\u2019m disgusted with this industry; I don\u2019t want to be invested in it,\u201d said Milgram. But, he added, \u201cThere are only so many hours in the day.\u201d Vanguard Group, the nation\u2019s largest fund company, said it was unrealistic to balance political sensibilities with obligations to meet performance benchmarks. \u201cIt would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to fulfill these obligations while managing portfolios that reflect the social concerns of all our clients,\u201d said Vanguard  spokeswoman Arianna Stefanoni Sherlock. Vanguard does, however, offer a Social Index fund \u2013 with about $2 billion in assets out of Vanguard\u2019s total of about $3.4 trillion \u2013 that excludes firearms companies along with other stocks involved in an array of ethically sensitive industries. Smith & Wesson declined to comment for this story. Vista Outdoor did not respond to requests for comment. Obama and his tiny stake are typical of most Americans with holdings in firearms investments: They are invested in funds that buy shares of the relatively small part of the firearms industry that is publicly traded. But collectively, their investments are a boon to the gun industry and amount to a sizable stake in major gun and ammo makers.  For some gun safety advocates, the amounts are less important than the principle. Po Murray, who put four children through Sandy Hook Elementary, has also struggled to determine whether her investments include firearms companies. \u201cIt\u2019s a real surprise: You find out you could be invested indirectly in Smith & Wesson,\u201d said Murray, who chairs the Newtown Action Alliance, a gun safety group. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be invested in gun companies.\u201d The $16 billion Illinois pension fund that includes Obama\u2019s investment holds at least $4.8 million in shares of gun industry stocks, including Smith & Wesson, Ruger, Vista and ammunition maker Olin Corp (OLN.N).  Until 2014, the pension fund owned about $1.5 million of the debt of Remington Outdoors, another gun manufacturer. Remington did not respond to requests for comment.  The Illinois pension plan also invests in at least one mutual fund with gun industry exposure. The $1.1 billion Templeton Global Smaller Companies Fund owned $9.5 million of Smith & Wesson stock at the end of December, fund disclosures show. Obama and other plan participants have no say in how the money is invested. That\u2019s controlled by the Illinois State Board of Investment, which said it has no policy on investing in firearm and ammo companies.  (For a graphic showing firearms investments by Obama\u2019s Illinois pension fund, see: tmsnrt.rs/1TlCRV0 ) In its analysis, Reuters used mutual fund holdings data from Morningstar and Lipper Inc, a Thomson Reuters company, to examine firearms investments during the Obama presidency.  The list of funds holding such stocks includes some of the biggest and most prominent, such as Vanguard and the second-largest fund group, Fidelity Investments. It extends to BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), and Dimensional Fund Advisors. The analysis is based on disclosures made by individual funds. Some of the gun stockholders are passively managed index funds. But many are actively managed, such as Fidelity\u2019s $40 billion Low-Priced Stock Fund (FLPSX.O), which has become Smith & Wesson\u2019s second-largest mutual fund investor under storied stock-picker Joel Tillinghast. The fund held about 1.1 million shares worth $20 million as of Oct. 31, according to fund disclosures. Fidelity and Dimensional declined to comment. BlackRock - the world\u2019s largest asset manager with $4.6 trillion under management - manages $200 billion of that total in investment options that screen out certain stocks, including companies involved in  firearms, tobacco and alcohol businesses, spokesman Peter McKillop said. Obama isn\u2019t the only gun-regulation advocate with gun-industry holdings. Former congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy - elected after her husband was killed in the 1993 Long Island Rail Road shooting - pushed relentlessly for gun safety legislation. While in office, she held shares worth between $3,003 and $45,000 in at least three exchange-traded funds with stakes in gun and ammo companies, according to her last financial disclosure before retiring last year. She also invested between $2,002 and $30,000 for two grandchildren in so-called 529 college-savings plans that include a Vanguard fund holding firearms stocks, disclosures show. The New York Democrat could not be reached for comment. As a federal retirement benefit, members of the U.S. Congress can participate in a Thrift Savings Plan, which offers an investment option - the S Fund - that holds stock in firearms companies. Financial disclosures show that S Fund investors include Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Senate Democrat and a leading advocate for stricter background checks for gun buyers. Durbin disclosed an S Fund investment of about $115,000.  Durbin\u2019s office declined to comment. Some members of Congress welcome the investment option. \u201cI\u2019m just grateful the fund managers are investing in something that\u2019s making money,\u201d said Representative Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican who opposes gun restrictions and has a small investment in the S fund. For all the debate, Obama has made no progress in passing tougher gun laws. Measures such as universal background checks have withered in Congress, where the number of anti-gun control Republicans has grown.  Calls for tighter controls have been met with bursts of gun sales, according to U.S. background-check data on gun purchasers. Gun store owners attribute the extra sales to consumers who fear the president will make it harder to buy arms. \u201cLet\u2019s just say he\u2019s been good for business,\u201d Jack Lesher, manager of Chuck\u2019s Firearms in Atlanta, said of Obama. Gun sales jumped again recently after the president blasted congressional inaction on gun control and vowed to use executive powers to expand background checks for buyers and bolster licensing requirements for dealers. His announcement followed yet another mass shooting, on Dec. 2 in San Bernardino, California, where a couple pledging allegiance to Islamic State killed 14 people.  For the week that ended Dec. 20, firearms background checks - a proxy for guns sales - totaled 839,109, the second-highest week since 1998. Only the week after the Sandy Hook shootings was higher, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Vista\u2019s main factories have churned out bullets 24 hours, seven days a week for at least two years, Vista Chief Financial Officer Stephen Nolan told investors in November.  Now the industry is ready for an election-year surge.  \u201cThe politics of gun control could stay in the headlines, which we believe could lead to a record year,\u201d wrote Chris Krueger, senior research analyst at Lake Street Capital Markets, in a note to investors in January. Ruger is boosting inventories to prepare, after learning a costly lesson going into the last presidential election. Demand peaked that year, based on the number of FBI background checks sought for new gun purchases. The surge followed Obama\u2019s re-election and the Sandy Hook shooting. \u201cWhen we went into late 2011, we got cleaned out of inventory \u2026 even though we increased production dramatically,\u201d company CEO Fifer told investors during a November conference call.  The company, he said, \u201cprobably left money on the table.\u201d ",

        "title": "Japan special panel to weigh timing of emperor's abdication",
        "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - The timing of Emperor Akihito s abdication, Japan s first in nearly two centuries, is to be discussed by a special panel that will meet from Dec. 1, the top government spokesman said on Wednesday. Akihito, who turns 84 on Dec. 23 and has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer, said in rare remarks last year that he feared age might make it hard to fulfill his duties. A law adopted in June that allows him to step down and be succeeded by Crown Prince Naruhito, 57, left details, such as timing, to be worked out. News the Imperial Household Council - whose 10 members include Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the chief justice of the Supreme Court along with two royals - would convene grabbed domestic headlines after Abe called on Akihito on Tuesday, apparently to inform the emperor of the meeting. Once considered divine, Japan s emperor is defined in the post-war constitution as a  symbol of the state and of the unity of the people , and he has no political power. But Akihito, who has spent much of his time on the throne seeking to soothe the wounds of a war fought in his father Hirohito s name, and consoling people suffering from disasters or other woes, is widely respected by many average Japanese. At a special news conference to announce the meeting, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga did not comment on media reports that two options were being considered - March 31, 2019, or April 30 that year.  After hearing (the panel s) opinion, based on that, we would like to decide the date promptly,  he said. The government had proposed the emperor retire at the end of 2018 but Imperial Household Agency officials demurred, media have said, citing a cluster of rituals and other events around that time. Some in government, however, now worry an alternate proposal of March 31, 2019, would be complicated by nationwide local elections set for that spring, media said. Once Akihito steps down, a new  imperial era  will begin, replacing the current  Heisei , or  achieving peace  period, which began on Jan. 8, 1989, the day he took the throne. Japan uses the Western-style Gregorian calendar but has also preserved the ancient custom in which the reign of a new emperor ushers in a new era. ",

        "title": "Tale of Two Donalds: Trump gives Europe splitting headache",
        "text": "VALLETTA (Reuters) - \u201cOur Donald\u201d, or \u201cthe other Donald\u201d? European Union leaders meeting in Malta found themselves taking sides, between their summit chairman, \u201cour Donald\u201d Tusk, and the new U.S. president, Donald Trump. But despite declarations of unity, EU states are split on how to respond to policies from a man who has reversed staunch postwar U.S. support for European integration and suggested others follow Britain out of a bloc he has called \u201ca vehicle for Germany\u201d. Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, said EU leaders gave him the \u201cour Donald\u201d nickname in Malta. He presented it as a sign of their support, saying before the summit that Trump posed a \u201cthreat\u201d to the bloc, alongside Russia, China and violent Islam. \u201cThe mood in the room was \u2018our Donald\u2019 and \u2018the other Donald\u2019,\u201d said one person present at the talks, where Tusk also felt confident enough in his support to confirm he wants a second term as president of the European Council. His political enemies in the Warsaw government publicly disavowed any sense of unanimity behind Tusk, however, calling his criticism of Trump a \u201cgross abuse\u201d and accusing him of \u201csowing fear\u201d and \u201cseeking confrontation\u201d.  Others, less publicly, said there was wider disquiet that the EU could turn its back on its Transatlantic relationship. Such internal arguments pit historic unease, especially in France, over U.S. influence against fears of weakening a Western front against Russia and, increasingly, China. How they play out will help shape Trump\u2019s hopes, for example, of saving U.S. money spent on NATO and shifting world trade in Americans\u2019 favor. They will also flavor the EU\u2019s Brexit talks with London - where Prime Minister Theresa May sees Britain being a bridge between Washington and Brussels - as well as efforts by some states to tighten cooperation on euro zone economic policies and other areas, notably an independent EU military capability. As a Pole well aware it is U.S. forces that underpin NATO\u2019s security guarantees in eastern Europe, Tusk nuanced his call to Europeans to pull together to defend their independent interests against the \u201csuperpowers, the United States, Russia and China\u201d with an appeal to Americans to preserve \u201cthe Transatlantic bond without which global order and peace cannot survive\u201d. But some leaders worry Trump\u2019s coolness toward NATO and the exit of well-armed Britain will fuel ambitions for Europeans to loosen that bond - notably in Paris, which has often chafed at \u201cAnglo-American\u201d influence and where officials say Trump shows France has been right to seek \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d for the EU. \u201cThe French ... are as usual saying \u2018It\u2019s just the European Union now; there\u2019s no such thing as the West\u2019,\u201d said a senior eastern European diplomat, criticizing Paris\u2019s view.  \u201cThe Germans are much more cautious. There is a clear issue to be decided on whether we should seek a common ground to engage with the United States, or turn our backs.\u201d As EU leaders prepare to map out a post-Brexit strategy at a 60th anniversary summit in Rome next month, French President Francois Hollande criticized Trump and eastern European governments he accused of raking in EU subsidies but then breaking ranks and undermining the bloc by seeking special favor from Washington. Many in the east are especially alarmed by Trump\u2019s warmer tone toward Russia but some back his entry ban on Muslims, which echoes their own criticisms of EU refugee policies. German Chancellor Angela Merkel took a less confrontational tone but stressed the need for \u201cmultilateralism\u201d - a prod to Trump not to try and circumvent the EU by talking only to national leaders, and to Europeans to speak with a single voice. Whether \u201cthe other Donald\u201d gets that message is another matter, given a seemingly hazy grasp on who is who in Brussels. The tycoon-turned-president told an interviewer last month he had spoken to \u201cthe head of the European Union\u201d and named his interlocutor as Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU chief executive.  In fact, however, he had spoken to \u201cour Donald\u201d, Tusk.  \u201cSometimes I have an impression that the new administration does not know the EU in detail,\u201d Juncker said drily on Friday. \u201cBut, in Europe, details matter.\u201d ",

        "title": "Two Republican senators seek to slash legal U.S. immigration",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Republican senators proposed steps to slash the number of legal immigrants admitted into the United States by half on Tuesday, but the legislation, developed with the Trump administration, faces an uphill climb to get through Congress. Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue said their bill would cut the number of immigrants granted U.S. residency each year to 500,000 from 1 million, through measures including cutting far back on which relatives can be brought into the country and eliminating a diversity visa lottery. The legislation does not address visas specifically tied to employment, such as the H-1B visas for skilled workers used by many technology companies. Cotton and Perdue said they had consulted Republican President Donald Trump, who vowed to crack down on both illegal and legal immigration during his campaign for the White House. Cotton said he had spoken to Trump about the bill by telephone as recently as Tuesday morning. The measure faces stiff opposition in Congress. Although Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives, several back comprehensive immigration reform, not a tough crackdown. Republican Senator John McCain said he disagreed with the bill. A long-time advocate for immigration reform, McCain praised the contribution of immigrants to the United States. \u201cWe need more Sergey Brins and people like that who were born outside of this country and came here, received an education and made enormous progress for all mankind,\u201d McCain told reporters, referring to the Google co-founder, who came to the United States as a refugee from Russia. Any measure also would need Democratic support to advance in the Senate, and Democrats, who cite studies showing that immigrants boost the U.S. economy, are strongly opposed. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen called it \u201cwrong and senseless\u201d to separate families and cut successful visa programs.  Perdue and Cotton acknowledged the bill would not come up any time soon, saying they hoped for a Senate vote this year. Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Congress first needed to address border security, but said the new measure \u201cwill be a helpful constructive proposal.\u201d The bill would admit only immediate family members of immigrants, eliminating preferences for adult siblings or adult children. Cotton said it would exclude parents unless they were sick and the family promised not to rely on public benefits. The proposal came amid a larger immigration fight over Trump\u2019s travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees. Cotton said his goal was to stop competition that lowers wages for workers without high school or college degrees. \u201cUnless we reverse this trend, we are going to create a near-permanent underclass for whom the American dream is always just out of reach,\u201d he said. Asked if the White House would support the legislation and whether it was working with the senators, a spokesman said, \u201cWe are reviewing it.\u201d U.S. companies often argue in favor of immigration. More than 100 filed a legal brief opposing Trump\u2019s travel ban.   ",

        "title": "Guatemala Congress says it will withdraw contested graft reforms",
        "text": "GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala s Congress announced on Thursday that it will withdraw controversial reforms that critics had described as a serious setback in the country s fight against political corruption. On Wednesday, Guatemala s Congress approved a  national emergency  decree to curb penalties for illegal election financing after President Jimmy Morales was linked to suspected irregularities during his 2015 election campaign. Morales, whose immunity from prosecution was reinforced by Congress earlier this week, had said he would veto the reforms if they were found to be harmful to the nation. After rowdy demonstrations in the capital on Thursday, Morales announced he had suspended an independence day parade that was to have taken place on Friday.  And as the public outcry mounted, leaders of the principal parties in Congress agreed to vote on Friday to cancel the measures, independent congressman Oliverio Garc a said.  There has been an objection from the general citizenship, organizations and institutions with respect to two decrees, and there is an agreement to not send those decrees to the executive (branch) and file them away definitively,  he told reporters.  The decrees would have been the latest blow to the attorney general s office and the United Nations-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) after Congress this week voted to preserve Morales  immunity from prosecution. Morales also urged Guatemalans on Thursday to remain calm and peaceful amid a charged atmosphere. The reforms were widely criticized in Guatemala, with opposition from the press and various government institutions and the human rights office. The U.S. ambassador to Guatemala, Todd Robinson, posted a scathing message on Twitter about the reforms, before Congress decided to withdraw them.  Years of malnutrition, insecurity, crime, corruption. Congress? No action. Amazing how fast they act to protect selves from prosecution,  he said.  Separately, Morales  presidential spokesman, Heinz Heimann, said the president would return a mysterious salary bonus that he had been receiving from the army and which raised his salary by more than a third, making him one of Latin America s best-paid leaders.  The president returned it out of good faith,  Heimann said of the payment, which is being probed by Guatemala s federal comptroller. On Monday, Morales will travel to New York and will head to the United Nations for the annual general assembly the following day. ",

        "text": "LIMA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama did in Latin America what he tried to do in Europe: tell worried citizens not to draw negative conclusions about the man he once called unfit to serve in the White House, President-elect Donald Trump. In the last stop of an international farewell tour that included visits to Greece and Germany, Obama continued his efforts to calm anxieties since Republican businessman Trump beat Democratic rival and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential race. \u201cMy main message to you ... and the message I delivered in Europe is don\u2019t just assume the worst,\u201d Obama told a group of young people during a question-and-answer session in Peru on Saturday. \u201cWait until the administration is in place, it\u2019s actually putting its policies together, and then you can make your judgments as to whether or not it\u2019s consistent with the international community\u2019s interest in living in peace and prosperity together.\u201d Trump won the election after promising to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, rip up trade deals and ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States. Obama has sought to soothe fears by pledging to ensure a smooth transition of power and expressing optimism that the president-elect would shift away from inflammatory campaign rhetoric once he faced the realities of the job. \u201cIt will be important for everybody around the world to not make immediate judgments but give this new president-elect a chance to put their team together, to examine the issues, to determine what their policies will be, because as I\u2019ve always said, how you campaign isn\u2019t always the same as how you govern,\u201d Obama said. But Obama has couched his assurances largely in hopeful language that Trump\u2019s team would see the merits of policies that Democrats championed despite Trump\u2019s pledged to dismantle them, from the Iran nuclear deal to an international pact to fight climate change. And the president, who campaigned vigorously for Clinton and showed visible disdain for Trump before his victory, has offset his words of reassurance with subtle digs at his successor by emphasizing themes of democratic values in Europe and Peru that Trump has been criticized for ignoring.  \u201cYou\u2019re seeing some countries that are going backwards rather than forwards in terms of freedom of the press, in terms of freedom of the Internet, in terms of respecting political opposition and civil society,\u201d Obama said on Saturday. Trump barred some news organizations from covering events during his campaign and threatened during a televised debate to jail Clinton for her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Though Obama came on his trip able to assure European countries that Trump would respect U.S. commitments to NATO, his other assurances, including for Latin American policy, seemed based more on optimism than knowledge of Trump\u2019s plans. \u201cWith respect to Latin America, I don\u2019t anticipate major changes in policy from the new administration,\u201d he said, citing trade as a key exception. Trump announced hawkish picks for attorney general, national security adviser, and CIA director on Friday that suggest he is setting up his administration to take a hard line confronting Islamist militancy and curbing illegal immigration.

        "title": "Factbox: Clinton's policies on economy, Islamic State, other issues",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has pledged to raise taxes on the wealthy, preserve the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented workers.\t Here are the proposals the former secretary of state has made as part of her argument that she is best qualified to occupy the Oval Office: Clinton has said the rich, not the middle class, would see their taxes go up. She supports billionaire investor Warren Buffett\u2019s eponymous tax proposal calling for those making more than $1 million a year to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Clinton has also called for an additional 4 percent tax on those making more than $5 million annually. Clinton has pledged to raise the estate tax levied on property transferred from a deceased person to their heirs. She also supports a tiered inheritance tax structure, with a top rate of 65 percent on the wealthiest estates of more than $500 million for a single person or $1 billion for a couple. Clinton has pledged to unveil a plan to rebuild U.S. infrastructure during her first 100 days, saying this would create new jobs. She would use some of the revenue generated from her tax plan to pay for making community colleges tuition-free and ensuring students can graduate from public colleges and universities without incurring debt. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that independently scored Clinton\u2019s proposals in their totality, estimated her policies would cost $1.8 trillion over the next decade and would be offset by $1.6 trillion, mostly generated by taxing high earners. The group said the remaining $200 billion could be covered by $275 billion in corporate tax revenue the Clinton campaign has called for but not yet spelled out in sufficient detail for them to credit as an offset at this time. Clinton has promised to propose broad legislation within her first 100 days in office to overhaul the immigration system and establish a process for undocumented workers to become citizens. Clinton has said she will defend executive actions taken by Democratic President Barack Obama to defer deportations of children brought illegally to the United States and the parents of children who are citizens or legal residents. She has said if Congress does not pass comprehensive immigration reform, she will similarly use executive action to defer deportations in \u201csympathetic cases.\u201d A federal court has ruled that Obama did not have the authority to issue his executive orders on immigration, known as DACA and DAPA. The U.S. Supreme Court, currently short one member, split 4-to-4 on whether to hear the administration\u2019s appeal, leaving the lower court\u2019s ruling in place for the time being. Clinton has promised to preserve the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law enacted after the financial crisis, and to pursue further measures to toughen Wall Street regulations. She has proposed a fee for large financial institutions based on their size and the level of risk they pose. She would also give regulators additional authority to force institutions that pose high risks to break apart or reorganize. Clinton has also urged strengthening the Volcker Rule, which restricts proprietary trading by commercial banks. She has called for a new tax on high-frequency trading and for stricter oversight of hedge funds, private equity firms and other players in the so-called shadow-banking system. She has promised stiffer policies on people who commit financial crimes, including an extension of the statute of limitations on such crimes and a requirement for bank executives to return bonuses if their institutions suffer major losses. Changes to Dodd-Frank have stalled in the Republican-controlled Congress, and it is unclear whether Clinton could get congressional backing to strengthen the law, unless Democrats win control of one or both chambers in the Nov. 8 election. Clinton has pledged to defeat Islamic State and has said the first step to fighting the militant group is to eliminate its strongholds in Iraq and Syria. In a departure from the Obama administration, she supports the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syria and has called for an intensified air campaign by the U.S.-led coalition. Clinton has said she would send additional American special forces to help Arab and Kurdish forces already on the ground. She opposes sending additional U.S. ground troops to the region. Clinton has said the United States and European allies must share intelligence more effectively in order to thwart potential attacks. She has urged Silicon Valley companies to work with the government to track militant recruitment tactics on the internet.  Current and former Obama administration officials have told Reuters they believe Clinton would  take a harder line on Russia than either Obama or Trump. Clinton has said she believes Russian hackers are behind the breach of Democratic Party systems in an attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election. Clinton has said Russia should play a role in combating Islamic State in Syria, and her foreign policy adviser has said she would consider arming government forces in Ukraine, one of Russia\u2019s neighbors, in a move to combat Russian \u201caggression in Europe.\u201d Russia has backed ethic Russian separatists in Ukraine. Clinton was a key player in Obama\u2019s \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia when she served as his secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Clinton has said she will \u201caggressively pursue trade cases and impose consequences\u201d against China when it commits trade abuses. She opposes granting China market-economy status, which China will be seeking when a World Trade Organization clause expires in December, and has said she would make sure a newly installed trade prosecutor would ensure that China is playing by the rules. Clinton has said she would treat cyber attacks from countries such as Russia and China \u201clike any other attack\u201d and that the United States \u201cwill be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.\u201d ",

        "title": "U.S. GMO food labeling bill passes Senate",
        "text": "(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved legislation that would for the first time require food to carry labels listing genetically-modified ingredients, which labeling supporters say could create loopholes for some U.S. crops. The Senate voted 63-30 for the bill that would display GMO contents with words, pictures or a bar code that can be scanned with smartphones. The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) would decide which ingredients would be considered genetically modified. The measure now goes to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass. Drawing praise from farmers, the bill sponsored by Republican Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas and Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan is the latest attempt to introduce a national standard that would override state laws, including Vermont\u2019s that some say is more stringent, and comes amid growing calls from consumers for greater transparency. \u201cThis bipartisan bill ensures that consumers and families throughout the United States will have access, for the first time ever, to information about their food through a mandatory, nationwide label for food products with GMOs,\u201d Stabenow said in a statement. A nationwide standard is favored by the food industry, which says state-by-state differences could inflate costs for labeling and distribution. But mandatory GMO labeling of any kind would still be seen as a loss for Big Food, which has spent millions lobbying against it. Farmers lobbied against the Vermont law, worrying that labeling stigmatizes GMO crops and could hurt demand for food containing those ingredients, but have applauded this law.     Critics like Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, say the bill\u2019s vague language and allowance for electronic labels for scanning could limit its scope and create confusion. \u201cWhen parents go to the store and purchase food, they have the right to know what is in the food their kids are going to be eating,\u201d Sanders said on the floor of the Senate ahead of the vote. He said at a news conference this week that major food manufacturers have already begun labeling products with GMO ingredients to meet the new law in his home state. Another opponent of the bill, Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, said it would institute weak federal requirements making it virtually impossible for consumers to access information about GMOs. Food ingredients like beet sugar and soybean oil, which can be derived from genetically-engineered crops but contain next to no genetic material by the time they are processed, may not fall under the law\u2019s definition of a bioengineered food, critics say. GMO corn may also be excluded thanks to ambiguous language, some said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) raised concerns about the involvement of the USDA in a list of worries sent in a June 27 memo to the Senate Agriculture Committee. In a letter to Stabenow last week, the USDA\u2019s general counsel tried to quell those worries, saying it would include commercially-grown GMO corn, soybeans, sugar and canola crops. The vast majority of corn, soybeans and sugar crops in the United States are produced from genetically-engineered seeds. The domestic sugar market has been strained by rising demand for non-GMO ingredients like cane sugar. The United States is the world\u2019s largest market for foods made with genetically altered ingredients. Many popular processed foods are made with soybeans, corn and other biotech crops whose genetic traits have been manipulated, often to make them resistant to insects and pesticides. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s not the ideal bill, but it is certainly the bill that can pass, which is the most important right now,\u201d said American Soybean Association\u2019s (ASA) director of policy communications Patrick Delaney. The association was part of the Coalition for Safe and Affordable Food, which lobbied for what labeling supporters termed the Deny Americans the Right to Know, or DARK Act, that would have made labeling voluntary. It was blocked by the Senate in March. ",

        "text": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - Several dozen women in Kenya said police officers attacked them during this year s election season and some said they were raped by men in uniform, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Thursday. More than 70 people were killed in an election in August, later nullified by the Supreme Court, and a repeat presidential poll in October won by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The opposition boycotted the repeat poll and said it would not be fair. The sexual attacks, mostly on women, occurred over this period in some of Nairobi s slums and in two opposition strongholds, Kisumu and Bungoma, in western Kenya, HRW said in a report.   Kenyan police dispute rights groups  allegations that officers used excessive force to quell election-related unrest. They did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment on the report. One 28-year-old woman in the Nairobi slum of Mathare told Reuters:  Four men in police uniforms burst into my home and my children were sleeping, they pulled my husband out. One grabbed my neck, the other pulled off my clothes, another beat me with a stick, and the other forced sex on me.   The woman who declined to be identified said she was four months pregnant and miscarried shortly after the rape.  I was bleeding and confused afterwards,  she said.    Another woman, aged 26, said:  Two men dragged me away from my friend, stripped off my clothes and one raped me as another one held me down.   Kenyan women who have been raped - they are lonely and abandoned and ashamed,  said HRW researcher Agnes Odhiambo.  It s the Kenyan government who should feel shame for failing to protect them and help them get medical treatment.   Kenyan rights groups accuse police of brutality and extrajudicial killings.  A government civilian watchdog tasked to oversee the police exists, but few officers are charged and convictions are extremely rare.  The sexual violence mirrored widespread violations against women after a disputed 2007 vote, when 1,200 people were killed, HRW said. At the time, the group documented at least 900 cases of sexual violence but said this was likely an underestimate.  The new cases related to the August and October 2017 elections demonstrate a disturbing continuum,  Tina Alai, a lawyer with New York-based Physicians for Human Rights.  Police have continued to perpetrate sexual violence against civilians they are obligated to protect,  she said. ",

        "title": "Texas committee passes bill to curb transgender bathroom access",
        "text": "AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A bill that would restrict access to public bathrooms by transgender people was approved by a Texas Senate committee on Wednesday after hundreds of people lined up for a nearly 21-hour session on that legislation, which critics said promotes discrimination. The bill would require people to use restrooms that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate, not the gender with which they identify.  It will now go to the Republican-controlled Senate where it is expected to pass. Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who guides the Senate agenda, has said the legislation is a priority. Analysts do not expect the bill to make it through the state House of Representatives, where there is more concern about the potential economic impact of such legislation. The bill, which focuses on a heated political issue in the United States, is similar to one enacted last year in North Carolina. That law prompted economic boycotts and the loss of sporting events that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. The Texas Association of Business released a study in January in which it said that if the legislation were enacted  it could cost Texas as much as $8.5 billion in the state\u2019s gross domestic product and the loss of more than 185,000 jobs in the first year alone. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has challenged the survey and brought North Carolina Republican Lieutenant Governor  Dan Forest to Texas to rally support for the bill. Nearly 70 businesses, including some of the state\u2019s biggest employers such as American Airlines, sent a letter to Republican leaders this month asking them to reject the bill on the grounds that it would \u201clegalize discrimination.\u201d THIRD-GRADER TESTIFIES Hundreds registered to testify, and more than 250 people addressed the committee. Some waited more than 12 hours while many bill opponents lined the corridors in the Capitol\u2019s dome.  \u201cAt the core of this bill is privacy,\u201d Republican state Senator Lois Kolkhorst, the bill\u2019s sponsor, told the committee. Almost all the testimony was against the bill while supporters said it would help prevent sexual predators from targeting women and children. Chelsa Morrison, whose 8-year-old daughter Marilyn started third grade at a suburban Dallas school after a gender transition, choked back tears as she told the committee that her daughter was bullied and if the legislation was enacted it would be devastating. Marilyn told lawmakers, \u201cTrans people are real. You are looking at one right now. This bill is horrifying to me and all of my transgender friends.\u201d  She said it would be embarrassing if she were forced to use the boys\u2019 bathroom. \u201cAll we got to do is tinkle and get out. That\u2019s all.\u201d Her mother said later in a telephone interview that Marilyn attended school in the latter part of last year for about a month, then left because of bullying and bathroom restrictions. She is now being schooled at home. Lieutenant Governor Patrick has called the bill common sense legislation. \u201cNorth Carolina was the tip of the spear,\u201d he told reporters this week. \u201cWe will be next to pass a bill that focuses on privacy, a person\u2019s privacy, and public safety.\u201d ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton rebuked Senate Republicans on Monday for denying a hearing to U.S. Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, accusing them of obstructionism, and warned of dangers if Donald Trump appointed the next justice. In a speech in Wisconsin, Clinton put the future of the Supreme Court at the center of the election debate, cautioning that any Trump-appointed justices would be likely to roll back workers\u2019 and abortion rights and \u201cdemolish pillars of the progressive movement.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of justice would a President Trump appoint, or for that matter what kind of attorney general?\u201d she asked, noting the Republican front-runner wants a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants. \u201cOnce you make the extreme normal, you open the door to even worse,\u201d she said in Madison, Wisconsin, as part of a two-day trip to the state ahead of its April 5 Democratic and Republican primary elections. Clinton called on Republican Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to \u201cdo his job\u201d and convene a hearing for Garland, a moderate federal appeals judge who is President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to fill the seat vacated by the Feb. 13 death of Antonin Scalia. Grassley and other Senate Republicans have said they will not hold a hearing or a vote on an Obama nominee in a presidential election year, contending that voters should have a say when they elect the next president on Nov. 8. \u201cI\u2019d say my voice is being ignored right now because of their obstructionism,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe chose a president \u2014 we chose him twice \u2014 and now Republicans in the Senate are acting like our votes didn\u2019t count and President Obama is not still our nation\u2019s leader.\u201d Clinton said the Republican refusal to consider Garland was the \u201clatest in a long line of actions aimed at disrupting our government and undermining our president, and the result is an America that is more divided, less functional and less secure.\u201d Grassley, a six-term senator from Iowa who has tangled with Clinton over the investigation into her use of a private e-mail account while secretary of state, responded that Clinton wanted to distract voters from the ongoing email investigations. \u201cThis is simply a blatant attempt by Secretary Clinton to politicize the Supreme Court and to change the conversation,\u201d Grassley, who heads the committee that must hold hearings on any Supreme Court nominee, said in a statement ahead of Clinton\u2019s speech. Clinton has apologized for the email arrangement, which is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and has been slammed by Republicans for potentially compromising security. Clinton has said she did nothing wrong and she believes the government will vindicate her. Garland traveled to Capitol Hill on Monday to meet with Democratic Senators Ben Cardin of Maryland and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. His first visit with a Republican, Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, is scheduled for Tuesday. Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote to Grassley on Monday and proposed hearings on Garland in April, with votes on the nomination by May 25. Clinton\u2019s speech came as her campaign aides argued with rival Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign in competing calls with the media over whether Sanders has a viable path to the Democratic presidential nomination. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, won contests in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington on Saturday, chipping away at Clinton\u2019s lead in the race for the 2,382 delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination at the party\u2019s Philadelphia convention in July. Clinton now has a lead of 268 pledged delegates over Sanders. When superdelegates, party leaders who can support any candidate, are added, Clinton leads 1,712-1,004, according to an Associated Press count. But Sanders aides said he could eclipse Clinton\u2019s advantage once the final round of contests are held on June 7, and that superdelegates would begin to switch to back Sanders once he did. \u201cWe are in this to win it, and there is a path to do so,\u201d campaign manager Jeff Weaver said. Clinton\u2019s campaign described her lead as \u201cinsurmountable\u201d given the party\u2019s proportional allocation of delegates in all states, which means Clinton will keep piling up delegates even in states Sanders wins. \u201cYou have to win these big states very big, you have to win by landslides\u201d to make up the deficit, Clinton strategist Joel Benenson told reporters. Trump also plans to campaign in Wisconsin this week as he seeks to build his lead over Republican rivals U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich.  Trump has won 738 of the 1,237 delegates needed to take the Republican nomination at its July convention in Cleveland. Cruz has won 463, while Kasich has won 143, according to The New York Times. ",

        "text": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said on Tuesday he is ready to sign a transgender rights bill if it passes in its current form in the state House of Representatives amid an acrimonious debate across the United States about the issue. Baker, a socially liberal Republican, had come under fire this year for refusing to say whether he would approve the bill, which would ban discrimination against transgender people in public restrooms and other public buildings. It passed the state Senate last month. \u201cNo one should be discriminated against in Massachusetts because of their gender identity,\u201d Baker said in a statement. \u201cI would sign the House version in its current form should it reach my desk.\u201d The Massachusetts House is due to vote on the measure on Wednesday.

The House version of the bill differs from the version passed by the Senate in that it directs the state attorney general to issue guidelines to law enforcement on how to handle people who claim transgender rights \u201cfor an improper purpose.\u201d That language is a nod to one of the main concerns of opponents of people using bathrooms or locker rooms that do not correspond with their birth gender - that sexual predators will claim transgender status to access potential victims. The measure would make liberal-leaning Massachusetts the 18th U.S. state to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity. The issue of transgender rights has become the latest front in America\u2019s culture wars. Some supporters of the Massachusetts measure described it as a rebuke to a law put in place in March in North Carolina prohibiting people from using bathrooms that do not correspond to the sex on their birth certificates.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed a $700 billion defense policy bill on Tuesday, backing President Donald Trump\u2019s call for a bigger, stronger military, but failing to decide how to fund the massive spending increase. The Republican-controlled House voted 356-70 for the annual National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which authorizes the level of defense spending and sets policies controlling how the money is spent. But the legislation defies spending caps set in the 2011 Budget Control Act and there is no clear plan from Congress on how to provide the money for the Pentagon. The 2018 NDAA authorizes $634 billion in base defense spending, for such things as buying weapons and paying the troops, well above the $549 billion allowed under the previous legislation. The NDAA also includes provisions such as an increase in active troop levels by more than 16,000, and states that climate change is a national security threat. The defense policy bill will become law if it passes the Republican-controlled Senate and is signed into law by the president, as expected. But spending will nonetheless be cut automatically if Congress cannot come up with a deal to resolve the gap in funding. Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said Congress\u2019 failure to address the issue makes life more difficult for military leaders because they cannot plan in advance. \u201cThis defense bill is $72 billion over the budget caps, so if we don\u2019t eliminate or raise the budget caps, that additional money will go away and leave us once again in the land of uncertainty for the Department of Defense,\u201d he said. Representative Mac Thornberry, the House Armed Service Committee\u2019s Republican chairman, said Congress needed to pass an appropriations bill to allow for the $700 billion. \u201cSecuring those appropriations must be Congress\u2019 top priority before the year ends,\u201d Thornberry said in a statement. The NDAA also includes about $66 billion in special war funding, which is exempt from the so-called sequestration cap. The measure passed by the House on Tuesday is a compromise reached by House and Senate negotiators between separate versions of the bill approved in the chambers earlier this year. However, a budget fight is expected because Senate Democrats may not agree to big increases in funds for the military if spending caps on non-defense programs are not also eased. The Republican majority in the Senate is so small that most legislation cannot pass without some Democratic votes. ",

        "title": "Trump recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital, reversing longtime U.S. policy",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday reversed decades of U.S. policy and recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, imperiling Middle East peace efforts and upsetting the Arab world and Western allies alike. Trump announced his administration would begin a process of moving the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a step expected to take years and one that his predecessors opted not to take to avoid inflaming tensions. The status of Jerusalem - home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian religions - is one of the biggest obstacles to reaching a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Trump s announcement as a  historic landmark,  but other close Western allies of Washington such as Britain and France were critical. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the United States  abdicated its role as a mediator in peace efforts, and Palestinian secular and Islamist factions called for a general strike and rallies on Thursday to protest. The international community does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the entire city, believing its status should be resolved in negotiations. No other country has its embassy in Jerusalem.  Trump s decision fulfills a campaign promise and will please Republican conservatives and evangelicals who make up a sizeable portion of his domestic support.   I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,  Trump said in a speech at the White House.  While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.    Trump s decision risks further inflaming a region already grappling with conflict in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Protests broke out in areas of Jordan s capital, Amman, inhabited by Palestinian refugees, and several hundred protesters gathered outside the U.S. consulate in Istanbul. The United States is asking Israel to temper its response to Trump s announcement because Washington expects a backlash and is weighing the potential threat to U.S. facilities and people, according to a State Department document seen by Reuters. Israel considers Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent state of theirs to be in the city s eastern sector, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally. Netanyahu said any peace deal with Palestinians must include Jerusalem as Israel s capital. That would be a non-starter for Palestinians in any negotiations if it meant the entire city would be under Israeli control. For a graphic on possible Jerusalem U.S. Embassy sites, click tmsnrt.rs/2jIXIoq Abbas on Wednesday called the city  the eternal capital of the state of Palestine.  He said Trump s decision was tantamount to the United States abdicating its peace mediator role. Jordan said Trump s decision was  legally null.   I think it s pretty catastrophic, frankly,  said Hussein Ibish at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, adding that  Trump did not distinguish in any meaningful sense between West Jerusalem and occupied East Jerusalem.  Palestinian Islamist group Hamas accused Trump of a  flagrant aggression against the Palestinian people.  Palestinians switched off Christmas lights at Jesus  traditional birthplace in Bethlehem on Wednesday night to protest Trump s move. Trump has tilted U.S. policy toward Israel since taking office in January.  He cannot expect to side entirely with Israel on the most sensitive and complex issues in the process, and yet expect the Palestinians to see the United States as an honest broker,  said former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Daniel Kurtzer. Pope Francis called for Jerusalem s status quo to be respected. China and Russia expressed concern the move could aggravate Middle East hostilities. A statement from the Saudi Royal Court said the Saudi government had expressed  condemnation and deep regret  about  the move. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May called the U.S. decision  unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region.  The United Nations Security Council is likely to meet on Friday over Trump s decision, diplomats said on Wednesday. Trump said his move was not intended to tip the scale in favor of Israel and that any deal involving the future of Jerusalem would have to be negotiated by the parties.     He insisted he was not taking a position on  any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders.    Other key disputes between the two sides include the fate of Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements built on occupied land. Trump made no mention of settlements. He said he remained committed to the two-state solution if the parties want one. The president called on the region to take his message calmly.  There will of course be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement but we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a place of greater understanding and cooperation,  Trump said. U.S. Representative Eliot Engel, a pro-Israel Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee who is often critical of Trump s foreign policy, said:  This decision is long overdue and helps correct a decades-long indignity.  Trump acted under a 1995 law that requires the United States to move its embassy to Jerusalem. His predecessors, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, consistently put off that decision.   Trump ordered a delay to any embassy move from Tel Aviv since the United States does not have an embassy in Jerusalem to move into. A senior administration official said it could take three to four years to build one. The Jerusalem decision has raised doubts about the Trump administration s ability to follow through on a peace effort that Trump s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, has led for months aimed at reviving long-stalled negotiations. There was no indication Trump asked Netanyahu for anything in return when he notified the Israeli leader of his Jerusalem decision on Tuesday, a person familiar with the matter said. But Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for Republican and Democratic administrations, said Trump, who has long touted himself as a master negotiator, might be setting the stage for seeking Israeli concessions later.  This might be the case where Trump applies a little honey now to show the Israelis he s the most pro-Israel president ever, and then applies a little vinegar later,  he said. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee have called for an investigation into whether the acting chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission exceeded his authority by taking steps to scale back or delay rules required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. In a letter to the SEC\u2019s internal watchdog, Inspector General Carl Hoecker, the Democrats said acting SEC Chairman Mike Piwowar should not have ordered staff to review the SEC\u2019s rules on \u201cconflict minerals\u201d and CEO pay ratios because they are mandated by Congress.  Both rules are part of Dodd-Frank, which was passed in 2010 to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis. Republicans have been highly critical of the law, saying its regulatory requirements are too burdensome for businesses. \u201cWe ask that you conduct an investigation into each of these decisions to determine whether they are legally permissible, and in keeping with the SEC\u2019s core mission,\u201d wrote the lawmakers, which include Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Brian Schatz of Hawaii. Brown is the top Democrat on the committee, which has 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats. Christopher Carofine, a spokesman for Piwowar\u2019s office, declined to comment. A spokesman for the inspector general\u2019s office could not be immediately reached for comment. In Wednesday\u2019s letter, the lawmakers also complained because Piwowar recently revoked the power of certain mid-level managers in the enforcement division to issue subpoenas, and vested the power solely with the unit\u2019s director. Decisions on how to delegate such authority rest with the SEC chair and do not require a commission vote.  Similarly, while the SEC chair cannot adopt rules unilaterally, SEC rules give the chairman fairly broad latitude to take other actions, such as hiring or directing staff to review rules. Piwowar, a Republican, became the temporary head of the SEC in January. President Donald Trump\u2019s choice for SEC chairman, Jay Clayton, is awaiting Senate confirmation. Piwowar announced in late January he had asked staff to review prior compliance guidance on the conflict minerals rule to determine if \u201cadditional relief\u201d is appropriate. He took similar steps with the CEO pay rule a few days later. The conflict minerals rule requires companies to tell investors if their products contain certain minerals from a war torn part of Africa.  The CEO pay ratio rule requires companies to provide a ratio comparing their chief executive officer\u2019s pay to the median workforce, and is set to start appearing in corporate filings during the 2018 proxy season.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders returned to Washington for meetings on Thursday with President Barack Obama and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid as Democrats pressured him to end his presidential campaign and support Hillary Clinton after a hard-fought primary race. Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, secured enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination this week and become the first woman to lead a major U.S. party as its presidential nominee. Despite Clinton\u2019s commanding victories in California and New Jersey in presidential contests on Tuesday, Sanders vowed to carry his populist campaign to the Democratic National Convention in July, when the party\u2019s nominee is formally chosen. Obama, who is expected to endorse Clinton soon, was scheduled to meet with Sanders at the White House on Thursday at 11:15 a.m. (1515 GMT). Sanders will meet with Reid, his Senate colleague, in the afternoon. The Sanders campaign, which waged an unexpectedly strong challenge to a better-known and better-funded Democrat, has decried what it called Clinton\u2019s anointment by the party establishment and the media. In an interview taped on Wednesday for broadcast on the NBC\u2019s \u201cTonight\u201d show on Thursday, Obama said he hoped that divisions between Democrats would start to heal in coming weeks now that Clinton has clinched the party\u2019s nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. At a fund-raiser in New York City on Wednesday, Obama said he was not too worried about bruised feelings after the primary and said \u201cit was a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to have a contested primary.\u201d Obama praised Sanders, the democratic socialist senator from Vermont, for bringing new energy and ideas to the party. \u201cHe pushed the party and challenged them,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it made Hillary a better candidate.\u201d Democrats are striking a delicate balance between the need to unite behind Clinton in the looming battle against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and not alienating Sanders and his supporters. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, herself a progressive known as a fiery critic of Wall Street, is preparing to endorse Clinton in the coming weeks after staying neutral in the Democratic primary, people familiar with her thinking told Reuters.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Republicans expect to introduce bills later this week that would bar states from setting their own rules for self-driving cars and take other steps to remove obstacles to putting such vehicles on the road, a spokeswoman said. The legislative action comes as major automakers are joining forces with auto suppliers and other groups to prod Congress into action. Last month, a U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee held a hearing on a Republican draft package of 14 bills that would allow U.S. regulators to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles a year per manufacturer from federal motor vehicle safety rules that prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls. Blair Ellis, a spokeswoman for the committee, said on Monday it was likely that legislation would be introduced this week and a formal hearing on the bills would occur next week.  Republican U.S. Representative Robert Latta said last month he hoped to win committee approval of a bipartisan legislative package by the end of July. The draft measures would bar states from setting self-driving rules and prevent the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from pre-approving self-driving car technologies. Democrats say the NHTSA must play a more aggressive role in mandating self-driving car safety. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group representing General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and others, and the Association of Global Automakers, representing major foreign automakers including Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Hyundai Motor Corp (005380.KS), are forming the Coalition for Future Mobility to press Congress to act. The group, which includes the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, National Federation of the Blind and Securing America\u2019s Future Energy, a group of corporate officials and retired military leaders, plans to begin airing radio ads on Tuesday portraying the legislation as \u201cliberating innovation for self-driving vehicles.\u201d GM, Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars. President Donald Trump\u2019s transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, has said she plans to quickly update those.   ",

The foundation, which gives most of the money it raises to St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, canceled the auction on Friday.

        "text": "HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish President Sauli Niinisto is set to be elected for a second six-year term in January elections by a wide margin, a poll commissioned by public broadcaster YLE showed on Thursday. Known for cultivating good relations with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, 69-year-old Niinisto   an independent candidate who previously represented the conservative National Coalition Party   had the support of 76 percent in the poll. Fourteen percent of respondents backed lawmaker Pekka Haavisto from the Greens of Finland while five others had in total around 10 percent. The president is in charge of Finland s foreign and defense policy together with the government, but otherwise the post has become largely ceremonial in the past few decades. Following the Ukraine crisis and chilly East-West relations, Niinisto has taken an active role in maintaining relations with neighboring Russia by regular contacts with Putin. Finland is an EU member but it has stayed out of the NATO  military alliance under its tradition of avoiding confrontation with Russia. The two countries share a 833 mile (1,340 km) border and a difficult history.  I don t easily declare myself as an advisor... But my message to Moscow, Brussels, Washington and any other place is: you should have dialogue,  Niinisto told reporters last week. The election will take place on January 28. If no candidate gets half of the votes, there will be a second round in February. If Niinisto and Haavisto met in a second round, Niinisto would win 82 percent of that vote, the poll showed.  The numbers are exceptional. Incumbent presidents always have an advantage, but we ve never seen one s popularity grow as the election gets closer,  said Johanna Vuorelma, political scientist at University of Helsinki.  With the current tensions in the Baltic Sea region, it seems people look for a safe and familiar candidate, and don t even want to consider alternatives.

The six-week show provides a  realistic and authentic look  at an actual military deployment, including the crash of an Airbus Tiger helicopter in July that killed both crew members, a defense ministry spokesman said on Friday. It will be shown Mondays through Thursdays on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, with a chatbot sending messages several times a day about the soldiers  activities.  Colonel Holger Neumann said the accident would play a role in one of the later episodes and would be treated with  the necessary sensitivity . The military last month resumed flights of the Tiger helicopters, but continues to investigate the cause of the crash. The show cost 6.5 million euros to produce and market, Neumann said, describing it as part of the military s drive to make the military a more attractive career option. The last show, which showed how new recruits were trained, sparked a 40-percent increase in traffic at the ministry s career website and a 25-percent boost in calls to a recruitment hotline, he said.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel stood fully behind the decision to fire more than 50 Cruise missiles at the airfield from where Washington said President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces launched a deadly chemical attack this week. \u201cIn both word and action, President Trump sent a strong and clear message today that the use and spread of chemical weapons will not be tolerated,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement.  \u201cIsrael ... hopes that this message of resolve in the face of the Assad regime\u2019s horrific actions will resonate not only in Damascus, but in Tehran, Pyongyang and elsewhere.\u201d During the six-year conflict in Syria, Israel has largely stayed on the sidelines, carrying out only occasional airstrikes when it feels threatened, including by the movement of weapons to Lebanese Hezbollah militants on its frontier with Syria. Israeli officials said the United States had informed them about the airstrikes ahead of time, but it was not clear whether Israel provided intelligence or any other form of input to the White House to support carrying out the attack. Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman called the U.S. move an \u201cimportant, necessary and moral message\u201d. \u201cThe American notification to the Israeli military and defence establishment before the strike is additional proof of the strength of the deep ties,\u201d he said.  Yaakov Amidror, Israel\u2019s former national security adviser, said the calibrated response by the United States had sent a message that Washington was reengaged in the region and that Russia did not have free rein in Syria.  \u201cThe Americans are telling the Russians: \u2018You are not alone any more, not in Syria not in the Middle East, and we are ready to take all the steps to be involved, and if you neutralise the U.N. Security Council, we will know how to act without its permission\u2019,\u201d he said on a conference call with reporters.  \u201cYet again, military action is an option that will be used when the Americans decide that it should be used and (tell hostile states): \u2018Watch your behaviour and your attitude towards American interests\u2019.\u201d Asked about the risk of retaliation, he said: \u201cThe chances for an attack initiated by either Syria or Hezbollah is even less today than before because now it is understood that if they violate the interests of the United States of America ... this administration is ready to take action.\u201d As for Israel stepping up its actions in Syria, Amidror said it would only engage if either of its two red lines are crossed: if strategic weapons are passed to Hezbollah units or if launch sites for attacks are set up in the Golan Heights, where Israeli-occupied territory borders Syria. \u201cWe will stay on the sidelines because our strategic decision was not to take part in this war. If there is something specific that we can do militarily or from an intelligence point of view and so on, I\u2019m sure that Israel would be more than happy to contribute to such efforts.\u201d        ",

        "text": "BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Spain s Constitutional Court on Thursday ordered the suspension of Monday s session of the regional Catalan parliament, throwing into doubt its plans to declare unilateral independence from Spain. The speaker of the Catalan parliament, Carme Forcadell, accused the Madrid government of using the courts to deal with political problems and said the regional assembly would not be censored. But she said parliamentary leaders had not yet decided whether to defy the central court and go ahead with the session. The suspension order further aggravated one of the biggest crises to hit Spain since the establishment of democracy on the 1975 death of General Francisco Franco. But Spanish markets rose on perceptions the order might ward off, at least for now, an outright independence declaration. Spanish Prime Mariano Rajoy called on Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont to drop independence plans or risk  greater evils . Secessionist Catalan politicians have pledged to unilaterally declare independence at Monday s session after Sunday s referendum, banned by Madrid and marked by violent scenes where Spanish police sought to hinder voting. The constitutional court said it had agreed to consider a legal challenge filed by the anti-secessionist Catalan Socialist Party.  Spanish shares and bonds, hit by the political turmoil in Catalonia, strengthened after the news of the court s decision. The main IBEX stock index rose 2.5 percent and the yield on Spain s 10-year bond fell. Spain s Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told Reuters in an interview the turmoil was damaging Catalonia.  This is generating uncertainty that is paralyzing all investment projects in Catalonia. I m convinced that, right now, not one international or national investor will take part in a new investment project until this is cleared up,  he said. Some of Catalonia s biggest businesses began taking steps to transfer their registered headquarters to other cities in Spain. The board of Spain s fifth-largest bank, Sabadell, decided at an extraordinary meeting on Thursday to move the bank s registered head office to Alicante, the bank said. The board of Caixabank, Spain s third-largest lender, will meet on Friday to study a possible transfer of its legal base away from Catalonia, a source familiar with the situation said. The Spanish government will approve a decree on Friday making it easier for companies to transfer their legal base out of Catalonia, two sources said, a move that could deal a serious blow to the region s finances as it considers independence. The new decree is tailor-made for Caixabank, sources familiar with the matter said, as it would make it possible for the bank to change its legal and tax base without having to hold a shareholders  meeting. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggest a minority of around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence. But a majority wanted a referendum to be held, and the violent police crackdown angered Catalans across the divide.  In an interview with Spanish news agency EFE, Prime Minister Rajoy said the solution to the Catalan crisis was a prompt return to legality and  a statement as soon as possible that there will not be a unilateral declaration of independence, because that will also avoid greater evils.  He did not elaborate but ruling party lawmakers say Rajoy, a conservative who has taken a hard line on Catalan independence, is considering the unprecedented step of dissolving the Catalan parliament and triggering regional elections. Catalan officials released preliminary referendum results showing 90 percent support in favour of breaking away. But turnout was only about 43 percent as Catalans who favour remaining part of Spain mainly boycotted the ballot and many polling stations were closed. Puigdemont said, in response to a question from the German Bild daily, he was not afraid of being arrested.  And I m not surprised any more about what the Spanish government is doing. My arrest is also possible, which would be a barbaric step.  Neither the Spanish government nor the judiciary has threatened to arrest Puigdemont, though Madrid accuses him of breaking the law by ignoring a Constitutional Court ruling forbidding the referendum. On Wednesday, in a televised address, Puigdemont renewed his call for mediation in the dispute but said the results of the referendum would have to be applied. Rajoy has ruled out international mediation as a format for resolving the future of Catalonia, offering instead all-party Spanish political talks to find a solution, on condition independence is taken off the table. Barcelona football club joined captain Andres Iniesta in calling for talks between the Spanish government and Catalan leaders to resolve the crisis.  We will go as far as people want it. But without the use of force,  Puigdemont told Bild.  I am sure that Spain will not be able to ignore the will of so many people.  ",

        "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - France won t let the official base of the European Union s parliament be moved from Strasbourg to Brussels, the country s European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said on Sunday.  Strasbourg must remain the seat of European democracy. It s also the symbol of Franco-German reconciliation,  she said on France 3 television.  It is often said that Europe comes down to the Brussels bubble. Europe needs to be closer to its regions,  she added. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) convene in Strasbourg for one week every month and in Brussels for the remainder. The monthly upheaval costs the bloc 114 million euros ($124 million) a year, EU auditors say. Critics have long called for the arrangement to be scrapped, but it has stayed in place largely because France would have vetoed any attempt to make the required amendment to the EU treaty. Some lawmakers had hoped the election victory of pro-EU President Emmanuel Macron could help plans to close the base in the French city. On Brexit negotiations, Loiseau said there were  positive noises  ahead of a summit in Brussels set to decide whether enough progress has been made on the first phase of negotiations to move on to talks about a post-Brexit trade relationship. But she said France remained vigilant on the issue of the land border with Ireland.  It s a red line which was drawn by the 27 member states and by the United Kingdom, accepted by them,  she said. Loiseau also said France was waiting for conclusions from the Eurostat statistics agency on whether the reimbursements it is due to make to companies after a dividend tax was canceled by courts should be all included in its 2017 accounts. That would scupper the French government s plans to bring its budget deficit below the EU-mandated 3 percent in 2017.  In all logic, there is no reason to attribute the whole 10 billion euros to 2017. That s what we explained, we are waiting for Eurostat answers,  she said. Loiseau, a career diplomat, also said she was disappointed by Germany s decision to vote in favor of clearing the use of weedkiller glyphosate for the next five years earlier this week. ",

        "title": "Chicago sues Trump administration over sanctuary city plan",
        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago on Monday sued to prevent the Trump administration from enforcing new policies that would withhold money from so-called sanctuary cities that deny U.S. immigration officials access to local jails. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, said the federal policies force the nation\u2019s third largest city to choose between its constitutional rights and funding for law enforcement. \u201cThese new conditions also fly in the face of longstanding City policy that promotes cooperation between local law enforcement and immigrant communities,\u201d the lawsuit said. The policies also include a requirement that local law enforcement agencies give federal authorities 48 hours notice before releasing anyone wanted for immigration violations. Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel said on Sunday that the city would sue, escalating a pushback against an immigration crackdown launched by Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cWe are bringing this legal challenge because the rhetoric, the threats from this administration embodied in these new conditions imposed on unrelated public safety grants funds are breeding a culture and climate of fear,\u201d Emanuel\u2019s senior legal adviser, Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel, said on Monday.The conditions from the Justice Department apply to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants, which provide money to hundreds of cities. Chicago is expected to receive $3.2 million this year for purchasing equipment. Siskel said the city will follow the initial complaint with a motion for a preliminary injunction to halt the government\u2019s imposition of the new conditions.  The city will request a decision from the judge before the Sept. 5 deadline to apply for the Byrne grant, Siskel said. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Monday that Chicago officials have shown an \u201copen hostility\u201d to enforcing laws designed to reduce crime and protect law enforcement.  He added that more Chicagoans were murdered last year than residents of Los Angeles and New York combined, and that Chicago needed to reverse a \u201cculture of lawlessness.\u201d \u201cThis administration will not simply give away grant dollars to city governments that proudly violate the rule of law and protect criminal aliens at the expense of public safety,\u201d Sessions said in a statement. The lawsuit is the first to challenge the Justice Department over the Byrne program but is not the first legal attack on the administration\u2019s sanctuary city policies.  Emanuel said on Sunday that the lawsuit would prevent the administration from setting a precedent that could be used to target other funding. Sanctuary cities in general offer illegal immigrants safe harbor by declining to use municipal resources to enforce federal immigration laws. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York and San Francisco, are part of the sanctuary movement. \u201cSanctuary city\u201d is not an official designation. The lawsuit came nearly two weeks after Sessions said the Justice Department would bar cities from the Byrne program unless they allowed immigration authorities unlimited access to local jails and give the 48 hours pre-release notice. Chicago and its high murder rate have been frequently criticized by Trump, and cracking down on illegal immigration was a theme of his 2016 presidential campaign. ",

        "title": "For Trump, the honeymoon with Putin may be finally over",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin tossed President-elect Donald Trump a bouquet in December when he chose not to retaliate for the U.S. expulsion of Russian diplomats and seizure of Russian diplomatic compounds. The honeymoon is over. Russia\u2019s tit-for-tat decision to expel hundreds of U.S. diplomats and seize two U.S. compounds may be an acknowledgment in Moscow that Trump\u2019s ability to bring better ties is limited, at best, and the start of a new downward spiral in relations. Russia took the step after the U.S. Senate on Thursday sent a breath-taking signal that it does not trust Trump on Russia by passing a bill that imposes new sanctions on Moscow and ties the president\u2019s hands if he seeks to ease them. The White House issued a statement on Friday night saying Trump had negotiated changes to the legislation and now intends to sign it. \u201c(The Russians) have taken Trump\u2019s measure and while they are willing to exploit his goofy fixation on Putin and naive sense you can do deals with someone like Putin ... they realize his clownish performance as president makes it really hard for him to deliver on any of the big things that Russia wants,\u201d said Andrew Weiss, a former national security council Russia expert. At the top of Russia\u2019s wish list is an easing of U.S. sanctions imposed for its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its destabilization of eastern Ukraine, something the Senate action would all but rule out. Another, all but inconceivable,  item would be formal U.S. recognition Russia\u2019s claim to Crimea. \u201cTrump\u2019s performance surely has left nobody in Moscow with the impression he is a guy who can deliver,\u201d said Weiss, now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank. Trump\u2019s desire, often expressed during the 2016 presidential campaign, to improve relations has been hamstrung by findings from U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered to help the Republican against Democrat Hillary Clinton. A federal law enforcement investigation and multiple U.S. congressional probes looking into the possibility that Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia, have made it harder for Trump to open a new chapter with Putin. Russia denies it interfered in the election and Trump has said there was no collusion. The Senate\u2019s 98-2 passage of the sanctions bill, which followed a 419-3 vote in the House of Representatives, forces Trump to take a hard line on Moscow or veto the legislation and infuriate his fellow Republicans. The huge margins mean Congress could easily override a veto. Weiss suggested that Trump\u2019s low approval ratings at home, his tendency to alienate NATO allies such as Germany and his inability to pass domestic legislation all contribute to a Russian perception that he is weakening the United States. \u201c(That) is going to pay dividends for Moscow, so there is no need to turn him away from the course he is already on which is self-destructive and bad for America\u2019s standing internationally. All of that is a huge win for the Kremlin,\u201d Weiss said. Russia gave the United States until Sept. 1 to cut its diplomatic staff in Russia to 455 people, the number of Russian diplomats left in the United States after Washington expelled 35 Russians in December because of the alleged election hacking. It also said it would seize a Moscow compound used by U.S. diplomats as well as a U.S. diplomatic warehouse. Some former officials said Russia could take other steps, such as seeking to help Russian-backed forces seize more ground in eastern Ukraine or to try to limit U.S. air operations in Syria, while others said any reaction might be more muted. Russia could look at imposing economic counter-sanctions against the United States, the former official said, saying he thought that retaliation in Ukraine or Syria was less likely because it was more likely to lead to a U.S. counter response. Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012-2014, said he does not think that Russia will escalate tensions with the United States just yet because Trump\u2019s assertions that he wants better relations with Moscow are encouraging Putin to continue seeking some kind of accommodation with the U.S. president. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to walk away from that just yet,\u201d said McFaul. \u201cI believe that Putin still believes there might be something he can do with Trump.\u201d ",

        "title": "Bolivia's Morales says he'll seek fourth term, spurs protests",
        "text": "LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivian President Evo Morales said on Thursday that opposition from the United States convinced him to run for a fourth term in 2019, spurring a second day of protests after the constitutional court eliminated term limits. Morales  government earlier brushed off criticism from Washington, which said it was  deeply concerned  over Tuesday s court decision. Morales himself then took it a step further, saying the U.S. reaction actually convinced him to run.  I was not so determined; now I am determined,  he said at a public event in the central Bolivian region of Cochabamba.  I will be a candidate, sisters and brothers, in 2019.  The court ruling is final and cannot be appealed. Groups opposed to the ruling protested in several cities again on Thursday, as opponents clashed with police outside an elections office in the city of Santa Cruz.  Bolivia has a constitution and we should respect it,  said Olga Flores, who identified as a human rights activist and was among several hundred protesters braving the rain in La Paz. Others chanted  Bolivia said no!   Morales, a former coca farmer in power since 2006, had previously accepted the results of a referendum in 2016, when 51 percent of voters rejected his proposal to end term limits. He later reversed course, saying that while he was willing to leave office, his supporters were pushing for him to stay.  The U.S. State Department disputed that position.   Twice in the last decade, the Bolivian people have expressed their opposition to the concept of indefinite reelection for elected officials,  the department s statement said. It referred to a vote in favor of the current constitution in 2009 and the 2016 referendum.   Morales  administration dismissed the criticism.  It looks like they are trying to tell us who our candidates should be,  the minister of the presidency, Rene Martinez, said. He said right-wing political forces in Bolivia had joined  with the United States and the Organization of American States to stop Morales from running again. Historically unstable Bolivia has enjoyed relative calm and  prosperity under Morales, the country s first indigenous president. Approval ratings for Morales, a fierce critic of capitalism and ally of embattled Venezuelan socialist leader Nicolas Maduro, hover at around 50 percent. In September, Morales  Movement to Socialism party asked the courts to rescind legal limits barring elected authorities from seeking reelection indefinitely. Morales says his first election took place under Bolivia s previous constitution and therefore did not count under the now-defunct two-term rule. ",

        "title": "South Korea expects more provocative acts by North Korea in mid-October",
        "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea expects more provocative acts by North Korea next month, to coincide with the anniversary of the founding of the North Korean communist party and China s all-important Communist Party Congress. During a meeting with President Moon Jae-in on Thursday, national security adviser Chung Eui-yong said he expected Pyongyang to act around Oct. 10 and 18, but gave no details. The South Korean security adviser s report also pointed to the risk that a military conflict could by sparked by  accidental incidents,  said Park Wan-ju, a lawmaker and head spokesman of the ruling Democratic Party.  The president said the United States speaks of military and diplomatic options, but South Korea can t go through war again,  said Park. Tension on the Korean peninsula has risen in recent weeks as North Korea s leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump exchanged war-like threats and insults over the North s nuclear and missile development program. The North has accused Trump of declaring war after he warned Kim s regime would not last if he persisted in threatening the United States and its allies, having earlier warned North Korea would be totally destroyed in such an event. Asked if China had a plan to respond to an emergency in North Korea, such as securing nuclear and missile sites, Chinese defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian said,  Military means cannot become an option,  and urged talks to resolve the issue. The Chinese military will make all necessary preparations to protect the country s sovereignty and security and regional peace and stability,  he added, without elaborating. China has vowed to uphold U.N. sanctions against North Korea, besides seeking to get stalled talks restarted with Pyongyang. On Thursday, China s commerce ministry said North Korean firms or joint ventures in China would be shut within 120 days of the latest United Nations Security Council sanctions passed on Sept. 12. Overseas Chinese joint ventures with North Korean entities or individuals will also be closed, the ministry said in a statement on its website, without providing a timeframe. The ministry had issued similar rules after a previous set of U.N. sanctions in August. Pyongyang conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3 and has launched dozens of missiles this year as it accelerates a program aimed at eventually targeting the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty. China, the North s main ally, would probably be extremely unhappy if Pyongyang tested a missile or carried out some other act during its Communist Party Congress, held every five years. Park said President Moon told the meeting that Washington and Seoul agreed that pressure needed to be applied to North Korea, with the door to talks still open. In a separate speech on Thursday, Moon said cooperation with the international community to curb the North s nuclear ambitions was at its highest ever and called for the strengthening of South Korea-U.S. defenses to rein in the North.  Expulsion of North Korean diplomats has been among the measures countries have taken against the reclusive state since its latest nuclear test. Malaysia banned citizens from traveling to North Korea, citing the escalating tension on the Korean peninsula. South Korean lawmakers said Chung had told them the United States and South Korea had agreed on the rotational deployment of U.S. strategic assets to South Korea, possibly as soon as year-end. The nature of the assets was not specified.  President Moon added it was inappropriate to discuss the deployment of nuclear weapons in South Korea, the lawmakers said.  Moon said he had opposed the deployment of U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system in South Korea, but rapid improvement in North Korea s missile capabilities prompted the decision. China opposes the deployment of THAAD because it believes its powerful radar could be used to look inside its territory. South Korea and the United States have said it is only to curb North Korea s missile threats. ",

        "text": " (Corrects spelling of Virginia House of Delegates member David Yancey throughout in this Dec. 19 story.) By Sharon Bernstein (Reuters) - Virginia Democrat Shelly Simonds won a seat in the House of Delegates by one vote, changing the power balance in the state legislature and extending a tide of Democratic victories beginning with November\u2019s capture of the governorship and several legislative seats. Simonds beat incumbent David Yancey in a recount held Tuesday, both parties said in statements released after the unofficial vote recount was completed by officials in Newport News. \u201cNever, ever forget how very much your vote counts,\u201d House of Delegates member David Toscano said on Twitter, one of many Democrats rejoicing that a single vote handed them the seat. \u201cI want to thank the voters who came out on Nov. 7,\u201d Simonds said in a news release. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have happened without their participation.\u201d Republican leaders in the House of Delegates welcomed Simonds and thanked Yancey for his service, but the chairman of the state party vowed to fight on. \u201cToday, our opponents carried the day,\u201d Republican Party of Virginia Chairman John Whitbeck said in a statement emailed to Reuters. \u201cTomorrow, we begin again.\u201d Simonds\u2019 election, which still must be affirmed by a panel of three judges, means that the 100-member House of Delegates will have an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.  That could lead to more moderate policies by forcing the parties to share power. Before the Nov. 7 general election, Republicans held 66 seats to Democrats\u2019 34, along with a majority in the state senate, according to the election information website Ballotpedia. The GOP still holds a slim margin in the senate. Also on Nov. 7, the state elected Democrat Ralph Northam in a bitter race for governor, dealing a setback to President Donald Trump with a decisive victory over a Republican who had adopted some of the president\u2019s combative tactics and issues.

        "title": "Echoes of Cold War as NATO mulls new North Atlantic command",
        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO needs to establish a new regional base for protecting the North Atlantic against increased Russian naval strength, a  senior alliance general said on Monday, as allies consider the next step in a military build-up reminiscent of the Cold War. General Petr Pavel, head of NATO s military committee, will help put the case to allied defense ministers this week for a new planning and strategy base to be located in a chosen NATO ally and focused on keeping Atlantic shipping lanes safe from enemy submarines. It would be the first such expansion in two decades after NATO sharply cut back its commands in 2011.  If we look at the growing capabilities of countries like Russia and China, with a global reach, it is quite obvious that maritime lines of communication have to be protected,  Pavel, a Czech army general, told Reuters in an interview.  We observe increased Russian naval activity in the Arctic in the northern Atlantic ... We also assess that for any future crisis, the reinforcement of Europe and free lines of communication will be vital for European security,  Pavel said.    If approved, the new North Atlantic Command would survey a vast area and, in the event of any potential conflict with Russia, have the task of making sea lanes safe for U.S reinforcements to Europe. Strong in symbolism, the decision is unlikely to revive a much larger Cold War-era Atlantic Command that was disbanded in 2002, but it would broaden NATO s new deterrent against Russia.   Despite NATO s cooperation with Moscow in the Balkans after a 1997 pact formalized friendly ties, the alliance sees the Kremlin s incursions in Georgia and eastern Ukraine and its seizure of Crimea as unacceptable breaches of international law. Pavel described Russia as a  potential threat , while the West was alarmed by Moscow s war games in September that massed tens of thousands of troops and may have tested electronic warfare tools on Latvia, NATO officials say. Since Russia s 2014 Crimea annexation, NATO has sought to reassure its Baltic allies by sending troops to the Baltics, Poland and the Black Sea, setting up a network of NATO outposts, holding more exercises and preparing a rapid response force, including air, maritime and special operations components. The United States have also returned tanks and troops to Europe after a long drawdown at the end of the Cold War. Russia condemns the moves as an aggressive strategy on its frontiers that threatens to destabilize eastern Europe. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will join other allied defense ministers on Wednesday and Thursday to decide whether to approve the North Atlantic Command, as well as a logistics command to focus on moving troops more quickly across Europe.  With renewed purpose since Russia s annexation of Crimea, NATO allies are broadly in favor of the two commands. Many are keen to lock in U.S. support given President Donald Trump s early doubts about the alliance he now says he strongly backs. Pavel cautioned that cost is likely to be an issue for NATO governments and said there were no short cuts in deterrence.   I believe we are now out of the realm of doing more with less. We simply have to understand that wherever we want to do more, there will be resource implications,  Pavel said. The alliance is being asked by Trump to do more in Afghanistan, in fighting Islamist militants and to stop migrants from the Middle East and North Africa reaching Europe. Many European NATO nations are still struggling to meet an alliance goal by 2024 to spend two percent of economic output on defense every year.  We can call it modernization, we can call it adaptation. We simply have to adapt to a new reality,  Pavel said.  ",

        "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States wants the United Nations Security Council to vote next Monday to impose  the strongest possible  sanctions on North Korea over its sixth and largest nuclear test, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Monday.  North Korea said it tested an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long-range missile on Sunday, prompting global condemnation and a U.S. warning of a  massive  military response if it or its allies were threatened. China s U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi pushed North Korea on Monday  to stop taking actions that are wrong, deteriorating the situation and not in line with its own interests and truly return to the track of solving the issue through dialogue.   Haley said the 15-member council would negotiate a draft resolution this week. She described North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as  begging for war  and that while the United States doesn t want conflict,  our country s patience is not unlimited.   Enough is enough,  Haley told the council.  Only the strongest sanctions will enable us to resolve this problem through diplomacy.  Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted eight resolutions ratcheting up sanctions on North Korea over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. Haley said the council s incremental approach to sanctions had not worked. The council last month imposed new sanctions over North Korea s two long-range missile launches in July.  The resolution aimed to slash by a third Pyongyang s $3 billion annual export revenue by banning exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood. Diplomats have said the council could now consider banning Pyongyang s textile exports and the country s national airline, stop supplies of oil to the government and military, prevent North Koreans from working abroad as well as add top officials to a blacklist to subject them to an asset freeze and travel ban.   A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, Russia or China to pass. Typically, China and Russia only view a test of a long-range missile or a nuclear weapon as a trigger for U.N. sanctions. China has not publicly said it will back new sanctions. Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said he would consider a U.S. draft resolution but questioned whether further sanctions would make a difference.   Whatever measures we are planning now, I m not sure that they will influence the other side to abandon what they have been doing. This is not the way to get parties at the table ... to seek for a political solution,  he told reporters. He told the council there was an urgent need to  maintain a cool head  and avoid escalating tensions, and called for a return to dialogue, including  by leveraging mediation efforts  of U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Both Russia and China pushed their proposal to kick-start talks with a joint suspension of North Korea s ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the military exercises by the United States and South Korea. Liu said he hoped it would be seriously considered by the parties.   The idea that some have suggested of a so-called freeze-for-freeze is insulting,  Haley told the council.  When a rogue regime has a nuclear weapon and an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) pointed at you, you do not take steps to lower your guard. No one would do that. We certainly won t.  Through sanctions, the Security Council has tried to choke off funding and support for North Korea s ballistic missile and nuclear programs, though some Western states have expressed doubt about Russia and China s commitment to implement them. Haley said in July that cutting off oil supplies to the North Korean government and military was an option.  China supplies most of North Korea s crude. According to South Korean data, Beijing supplies roughly 500,000 tonnes of crude oil annually. It also exports 200,000 tonnes of oil products, according to U.N. data. The U.N. resolution adopted last month capped the number of North Koreans working abroad at the current level. Diplomats said a new resolution could impose a complete ban. Some diplomats estimate that between 60,000 and 100,000 North Koreans work abroad. A U.N. human rights investigator said in 2015 that North Korea was forcing more than 50,000 people to work abroad, mainly in Russia and China, earning between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion a year. The council could ban textiles, which were North Korea s second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totaling $752 million, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). Nearly 80 percent of the textile exports went to China. The military-controlled airline, Air Koryo, could be banned. It flies to Beijing and a few other cities in China, including Dandong, the main transit point for trade between the two countries. It also flies to Vladivostok in Russia, but flights to Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Kuwait have ended. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California and Wisconsin said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was incorrect when it notified them last week they  were among 21 states whose election systems were targeted by Russian hackers during the 2016 election. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said on Thursday DHS notified the state that Russian cyber actors \u201c\u2018scanned\u2019 California\u2019s Internet-facing systems in 2016, including Secretary of State websites.\u201d California said after asking for more details \u201cit became clear that DHS\u2019 conclusions were wrong. DHS confirmed that Russian scanning activity had actually occurred on the California Department of Technology statewide network, not any Secretary of State website.\u201d Padilla said that the notification \u201cwas not only a year late, it also turned out to be bad information.\u201d DHS spokesman Scott McConnell said notifications to 21 states were \u201cbased on a variety of sources, including scanning detected from malicious IP addresses and intelligence information that cannot be publicly disclosed.\u201d The government has \u201cprovided additional information and clarity to a number of states,\u201d he said. DHS \u201cstands by its assessment that Internet-connected networks in 21 states were the target of Russian government cyber actors seeking vulnerabilities and access to U.S. election infrastructure,\u201d he said. Wisconsin election officials on Wednesday released an email from DHS that said the IP address targeted was at the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, not the state\u2019s elections commission. DHS told states including Ohio, Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Minnesota, Texas, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Iowa, Maryland and Washington state they were targeted by Russian hackers but said the hackers were not successful. Arizona and Illinois confirmed last year that they were targets. There is no evidence any votes were changed, DHS said. Russia has denied election meddling, and President Donald Trump has denied any collusion with Russia. \u201cThere remains no evidence that the Russians altered one vote or changed one registration,\u201d said Judd Choate, president of the U.S. National Association of State Election Directors.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded the Kremlin orchestrated an operation that included hacking and online propaganda intended to help Trump win, Reuters reported in August. Several congressional committees are investigating and special counsel Robert Mueller is leading a separate probe into the Russia matter, including whether Moscow colluded with the Trump campaign. ",

        "title": "Putin and Trump likely to discuss Ukraine sanctions: White House aide",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump are likely to discuss the sanctions that Washington imposed on Russia over the conflict in Ukraine when the two leaders speak by telephone on Saturday, a senior White House aide said. Trump has said in the past that, as part of a rapprochement he is seeking with Russia, he is prepared to review sanctions that his predecessor, Barack Obama, imposed on Russia over its 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea Peninsula. That move would face resistance from both influential figures in Washington and foreign leaders who believe sanctions should only be eased if Moscow complies with the West\u2019s conditions on Ukraine. Among the U.S. sanctions causing the most pain to Russia are those targeting its financial services, limiting the Russian economy\u2019s ability to raise debt, and its energy companies.  On the same day he speaks to Putin, Trump will have telephone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, White House spokesman Sean Spicer wrote in a Tweet. Both Hollande and Merkel have argued that it is premature to ease the sanctions. Trump senior aide Kellyanne Conway said in U.S. television interviews on Friday that Trump and Putin would likely discuss a range of issues, including joint efforts to combat terrorism.  Asked on FOX News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d program to comment on suggestions that the Obama administration sanctions would be on the agenda, Conway said: \u201cAll of that is under consideration.\u201d The call will be the first between the Russian and U.S. leaders since Putin called Trump to congratulate him on his election victory in November.  It is a first step towards what Trump has billed as a normalization of relations after three years of tensions sparked by the conflict in Ukraine. Trump and Putin have never met and it was unclear how their very different personalities would gel. Trump is a flamboyant real estate deal-maker who often acts on gut instinct, while Putin is a former Soviet spy who calculates each step methodically. Both have spoken about ending the enmity that has dragged U.S.-Russia relations to their lowest ebb since the Cold War.     \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if we actually got along with people? Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia? I am all for it,\u201d Trump told a news conference in July last year. Trump is under intense scrutiny at home from critics who say he was elected with help from Russian intelligence \u2014 an allegation he denies \u2014 and that he is too ready to cut deals with a country that many of his own officials say is a threat to U.S. security. Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov, said the Russian leader would use the call to congratulate Trump on taking office and to exchange views on U.S.-Russian ties. Asked by reporters if Ukraine would come up, Peskov said: \u201cThis is the first telephone contact since President Trump took office, so one should hardly expect that (it)...will involve substantive discussions across the whole range of issues.  \u201cWe\u2019ll see, let\u2019s be patient.\u201d If Putin and Trump can establish a rapport, it could pave the way for deals on Ukraine and Syria, two sources of friction during the administration of Barack Obama. For the Russian leader, there is much to gain. Putin is expected to run for re-election next year, but is hampered by a sluggish economy. A softening or removal of sanctions would allow Western investment and credit to flow in, lifting growth and strengthening Putin\u2019s election prospects. Any move by Trump to ease sanctions would create a dilemma for the European Union, which has its own set of sanctions against Russia linked to the Ukraine crisis. Some governments in Europe are sympathetic with Trump\u2019s stance and keen for relief from sanctions that are hurting trade with Russia. Others in the bloc believe Moscow has not met the conditions for the sanctions to be lifted. Merkel, who faces a re-election battle, has invested considerable political capital in keeping the EU aligned behind the sanctions. A German diplomat told Reuters last month: \u201cIf Trump lifts the sanctions, I fear the consensus in Europe would crumble.\u201d Merkel and French President Francois Hollande met in Berlin on Friday, underlining the challenges for European unity in the face of a new U.S. president who has promised to shake up the status quo in international affairs. \u201cLet\u2019s say it honestly, there is the challenge posed by the new U.S. administration, regarding trade rules and what our position will be on managing conflicts in the world,\u201d Hollande, who will leave office after an April-May election, told reporters.

At least 2,521 civilians were killed during the nine-month battle including 741 people who were executed, the report said.  Most died as a result of Islamic State (ISIL) attacks. It cited testimonies of mass abductions by Islamic State, as well as killings, the use of human shields, and deliberate targeting of civilians and their homes.  ISIL planted  a huge number  of improvised explosive devices and used drones to drop explosives in Mosul, a city of 1.5 million, as well as setting fire to sulphur fields and oil wells, it said.  Its forces desecrated religious sites and last June blew up the al-Nuri mosque from which its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had declared the caliphate spanning parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014, it said.  Iraqi courts and tribunals do not have jurisdiction over international crimes (such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes) - and prosecutors, police investigators and judges lack capacity to ... (investigate), charge and try persons in relation to such crimes,  the report said, calling for it to amend domestic law. Iraqi law did not do enough to guarantee due process or fair trials, it said. Accepting the jurisdiction of the Hague-based ICC and finding other ways to ensure crimes were tried by a competent court  would reassure the international community that Iraq is serious  about getting justice, which was key to rebuilding trust and reconciliation, it said. Atleast 74 massgraveshave been discovered since June 2014 in areas previouslyheld by ISILin Iraq, the U.N. report said. These included in Sinjar, the northwestern city where the U.N. has said Islamic State committed genocide against the Kurdish-speaking Yazidi religious minority whom the Sunni militants view as infidels. Iraq and the international community have a duty to ensure those crimes are prosecuted, Syracuse University professor and former war crimes prosecutor David Crane said on Wednesday in a separate report into the genocide, issued by his law school s Syrian Accountability Project.   Bringing ISIS to justice for genocide against the Yazidi community, at the domestic or the international level, will depend on the strategic preservation of forensic evidence,  Crane s report said. The U.N. report also called on Iraqi authorities to investigate crimes allegedly committed by Iraqi-backed forces during the operation, including mass abductions and unlawful killings. It called for a separate investigation into air strikes by the international coalition. It said the U.N. had recorded 461 civilian deaths from air strikes during the most intensive phase of the battle for western Mosul, from Feb. 19. ",

A senior EPA official who had been briefed by members of the Trump administration mentioned the executive orders at a meeting of staffers in the EPA\u2019s Office of General Counsel on Tuesday, but did not provide details about what the orders would say, said the sources, who asked not to be named. \u201cIt was just a heads-up to expect some executive orders, that\u2019s it,\u201d one of the sources said.  The second source said attendees at the meeting were told Trump would sign between two and five executive orders. Trump administration officials did not respond to requests for comment. Trump has promised to cut U.S. environmental rules - including those ushered in by former President Barack Obama targeting carbon dioxide emissions - as a way to bolster the drilling and coal mining industries, but has vowed to do so without compromising air and water quality.  Trump has also expressed doubts about the science behind climate change and promised during his campaign to pull the United States out of a global pact to combat it. Since his election in November, he has softened that stance, saying he would keep an \u201copen mind\u201d to the climate accord. Trump\u2019s pick to run the EPA, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, is scheduled to face a Senate confirmation vote on Friday, according to a Senate aide, after a contentious hearing last month in which lawmakers pressed Pruitt on his ties to the oil industry. Pruitt sued the EPA more than a dozen times to block its regulations while he was the top prosecutor for the oil and gas producing state.  Trump and Pruitt\u2019s positions have worried EPA staff, who are concerned the new administration will cut the EPA\u2019s budget, critical programs and scientific research. [nL1N1FR1JK] Some Republican lawmakers, emboldened by Trump\u2019s election, have raised pressure on the EPA in recent days.  On Tuesday, Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology, asked the EPA\u2019s inspector general to investigate whether EPA staff were using encrypted messages to coordinate efforts to derail the new administration\u2019s agenda, in possible violation of federal records laws. Earlier this month, Rep. Matt Gaetz introduced a 45-word bill to \u201cterminate\u201d the EPA - a piece of legislation that is not expected to pass.",

        "title": "Factbox: International reaction to arrest of Reuters reporters in Myanmar",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Major governments, including the United States, the European Union and Canada, and top United Nations  officials, are among those demanding the release of Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo from detention in Myanmar.  The reporters were arrested on Dec. 12 after being invited to meet police officials on the outskirts of Yangon. They had worked on stories about a military crackdown in Rakhine state, scene of around 650,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh since August. Myanmar s Ministry of Information has said the reporters  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media,  and released a photo of them in handcuffs. It said the reporters and two policemen faced charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years, though officials said they have not been charged. Their exact whereabouts are not known.  We and their families continue to be denied access to them or to the most basic information about their well-being and whereabouts,  Reuters President and Editor-In-Chief Stephen J. Adler said last week in a statement calling for their immediate release.      Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are journalists who perform a crucial role in shedding light on news of global interest, and they are innocent of any wrongdoing,  he said. Here are comments on their detention from governments, politicians, human rights groups, journalists and press freedom advocates around the world:   - The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday that releasing the two journalists immediately  would help restore at least some lost faith  in Aung San Suu Kyi s government. - Former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said it was  disturbing  to hear of the detention of the two Reuters journalists.  Press freedom is very important,  she said in a tweet on Christmas Day. - Two U.N. human rights experts called on Myanmar last week to release the two reporters, saying it was putting Myanmar on a dangerous path by using the Official Secrets Act to criminalize journalism.  Journalism is not a crime. These detentions are another way for the Government to censor information about the military s role in Rakhine State and the humanitarian catastrophe taking place,  said Yanghee Lee and David Kaye, who are the U.N. special rapporteur on Myanmar and on freedom of expression respectively. - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said the United States was  demanding their immediate release or information as to the circumstances around their disappearance.  Last week,  the State Department reiterated the U.S. demand for the reporters  immediate release. - Senator Ben Cardin, the leading Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee called the arrests  outrageous .  It just brings back the memory of the horrible practices with the repressive military rule,  he said. - Republican Thom Tillis and Democrat Chris Coons, leaders of the U.S. Senate Human Rights Caucus, said they were  gravely concerned  about the reporters  arrests and that press freedom was critical to ensuring accountability for violence against the Rohingya.  - Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kano said last week,  Freedom of the press is extremely important, including in order to protect fundamental human rights. The Japanese government would like to watch (this matter) closely.  Tokyo-based Human Rights Now has called on Japan to take a stronger stance.  - The European Union has urged Myanmar to release the reporters  as quickly as possible.  A spokeswoman for EU  foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said,  Freedom of the press and media is the foundation and a cornerstone of any democracy.  - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said countries should do everything possible to secure the journalists  release and press freedom in Myanmar.  It is clearly a concern in relation to the erosion of press freedom in the country,  he said.  - Britain, Holland, Canada, Norway and Sweden have demanded the release of the Reuters reporters. Australia has expressed concern and Bangladesh has denounced the arrests.  - Vijay Nambiar, former special adviser on Myanmar to the U.N. Secretary-General, said in a statement to Reuters that the detentions had caused  widespread disappointment within and outside the country that is likely to further damage the international reputation and image of Myanmar.  - President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani called on Myanmar to protect media freedoms and release the reporters. - Human Rights Watch said the detentions appeared to be  aimed at stopping independent reporting of the ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya.  Brad Adams, the group s Asia director, said,  Their secret, incommunicado detention lays bare government efforts to silence media reporting on critical issues.   - The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) called on Myanmar to immediately disclose the reporters  whereabouts.  All detainees must be allowed prompt access to a lawyer and to family members,  said Frederick Rawski, ICJ s Asia-Pacific Regional Director. - The Committee to Protect Journalists said the arrests were  having a grave impact on the ability of journalists to cover a story of vital global importance . - Reporters Without Borders said there was no justification for the arrests and the charges being considered against the journalists were  completely spurious . - Advocacy group Fortify Rights demanded Myanmar  immediately and unconditionally release the Reuters journalists.  - Myanmar s Irrawaddy online news site called on Dec. 14 for the journalists  release in an editorial headlined  The Crackdown on the Media Must Stop.  It said  it is an outrage to see the Ministry of Information release a police record photo of reporters handcuffed   as police normally do to criminals   on its website soon after the detention. It is chilling to see that MOI has suddenly brought us back to the olden days of a repressive regime.  - The Southeast Asian Press Alliance said the journalists were  only doing their jobs in trying to fill the void of information on the Rohingya conflict.   - The Protection Committee for Myanmar Journalists, local reporters who have demonstrated against prosecutions of journalists, decried the  unfair arrests that affect media freedom .  - The Foreign Correspondents  Club of Myanmar said it was  appalled  by the arrests and  gravely concerned  about press freedom in Myanmar.  - The Foreign Correspondents  Club in Thailand, Foreign Correspondents  Association of the Philippines, Jakarta Foreign Correspondents  Club and Foreign Correspondents  Club of Hong Kong have issued statements supporting the journalists.

        "title": "U.S. state election officials still in the dark on Russian hacking",
        "text": "ANAHEIM, Calif. (Reuters) - The federal government has not notified U.S. state election officials if their voting systems were targeted by suspected Russian hackers during the 2016 presidential campaign, and the information will likely never be made public, a top state election chief told Reuters. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely never going to learn it, because we don\u2019t even know it,\u201d Judd Choate, state election director for Colorado and president of the National Association of State Election Directors, said in an interview on Thursday during the group\u2019s summer conference. Nearly 10 months after Republican Donald Trump\u2019s upset presidential victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton, Choate said he had not spoken to a single state election director who had been told by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security if their state was among those attacked. The lack of information-sharing on the election breaches reflects the difficulty state and federal officials have had in working together to protect U.S. voting from cyber threats. All U.S. elections are run by state and local governments, which have varying degrees of technical competence. DHS told Congress in June that 21 states were targeted during the 2016 presidential race, and that while a small number were breached, there was no evidence any votes were manipulated.  Other reports have said 39 states were targeted. Choate said he had heard both numbers mentioned. Several lawmakers, including Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, have expressed frustration at DHS\u2019 refusal to identify which states had been targeted. Arizona and Illinois confirmed last year that hackers had targeted their voter registration systems. In a statement, the DHS did not refute that states had not been notified if they were targeted, adding the agency informed the owners or operators of systems potentially victimized \u201cwho may not necessarily\u201d be state election officials.  DHS was working with senior state election officials \u201cto determine how best to share this information while protecting the integrity of investigations and the confidentiality of system owners,\u201d the agency said. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the Kremlin orchestrated an operation that included hacking and online propaganda intended to tilt the November election in Trump\u2019s favor. Several congressional committees are investigating and Special Counsel Robert Mueller is leading a separate probe into the Russia matter, including whether Moscow colluded with the Trump campaign. Russia has denied election meddling and Trump has denied any collusion. The four-day conference of election directors was originally supposed to be about issues like voter registration, but took a sharp turn following the election hacking. \u201cAfter the 2000 election, we all had to be lawyers,\u201d Choate said. \u201cAnd now after the 2016 election, we all have to be cyber security experts.\u201d DHS representatives at the event fended off questions about whether the federal government would be prepared to mobilize sufficient support for the states in the event of a catastrophic cyber attack near or during the 2018 elections.  \u201cWe want to make sure we learn from the missteps that may have happened in 2016 and we want to make sure we continue building on the things we did that were right,\u201d Robert Gatlin, a DHS cyber official, said during a panel discussion. Gatlin said the agency was working with U.S. intelligence agencies to \u201cdowngrade\u201d more classified information so it could be shared with the states. Information about cyber attacks is typically guarded by a high classification because it may involve nation-state involvement or contain sensitive sources and methods, he said. Legislation recently approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee would require the director of national intelligence to sponsor top-secret security clearance for eligible election officials in each state, something the National Association of Secretaries of State has advocated. The bill would also require DHS to submit a report to Congress detailing cyber attacks and attempted cyber attacks by foreign governments on U.S. election infrastructure during the 2016 election. Choate said communication about cyber threats had improved with federal agencies since the election and the decision by the outgoing Obama administration in January to elevate voting systems to a \u201ccritical infrastructure designation.\u201d  Prior to the election, some state officials worried that closer oversight of election systems represented a dangerous federal intrusion into local affairs.

        "title": "CIA contractors likely source of latest WikiLeaks release: U.S. officials",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contractors likely breached security and handed over documents describing the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s use of hacking tools to anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials told Reuters on Wednesday. Two officials speaking on condition of anonymity said intelligence agencies have been aware since the end of last year of the breach, which led to WikiLeaks releasing thousands of pages of information on its website on Tuesday. According to the documents, CIA hackers could get into Apple Inc (AAPL.O) iPhones, devices running Google\u2019s Android software and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software. The White House said on Wednesday that President Donald Trump was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about the CIA security breach that led to the WikiLeaks release. \u201cAnybody who leaks classified information will be held to the highest degree of law,\u201d spokesman Sean Spicer said. The two officials told Reuters they believed the published documents about CIA hacking techniques used between 2013 and 2016 were authentic. One of the officials with knowledge of the investigation said companies that are contractors for the CIA have been checking to see which of their employees had access to the material that WikiLeaks published, and then going over their computer logs, emails and other communications for any evidence of who might be responsible. On Tuesday in a press release, WikiLeaks itself said the CIA had \u201clost control\u201d of an archive of hacking methods and it  appeared to have been circulated \u201camong former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.\u201d The CIA, which is the United States\u2019 civilian foreign intelligence service, declined to comment on the authenticity of purported intelligence documents.  The agency said in a statement that its mission was to collect foreign intelligence abroad \u201cto protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries\u201d and to be \u201cinnovative, cutting-edge, and the first line of defense in protecting this country from enemies abroad.\u201d The CIA is legally prohibited from surveillance inside the United States and \u201cdoes not do so\u201d, the statement added. A U.S. government source familiar with the matter said it would be normal for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the CIA both to open investigations into such leaks. U.S. officials previously have confirmed that prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia for years have been conducting a federal grand jury investigation of WikiLeaks and its personnel.  A spokesman for the prosecutors declined to comment on the possibility of that probe being expanded. It is not clear if the investigation of the latest CIA leaks is part of the probe. Contractors have been revealed as the source of sensitive government information leaks in recent years, most notably Edward Snowden and Harold Thomas Martin, both employed by consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH.N) while working for the National Security Agency.  U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and a Democrat on the intelligence committee, said the government needed to stop the breaches.   \u201cI think we really need to take a look at the contractor portion of the employee workforce, because you have to be loyal to America to work for an intelligence agency, otherwise don\u2019t do it,\u201d Feinstein said. Both U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committees have either opened or are expected to open inquiries into the CIA breach, congressional officials said. Some cyber security experts and technology companies have criticized the government for opting to exploit rather than disclose software vulnerabilities, though an interagency review process set up under former President Barack Obama was intended to err on the side of disclosure. Those concerns would grow if U.S. authorities did not notify companies that CIA documents describing various hacking techniques had been compromised. Apple, Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google, Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) did not immediately respond when asked if they were notified of a CIA breach before WikiLeaks made its files public. At Apple, none of the vulnerabilities described in the documents provoked a panic, though analysis was continuing, according to a person who spoke with engineers there. Google\u2019s director of information security and privacy,  Heather Adkins, said in a statement: \u201cAs we\u2019ve reviewed the documents, we\u2019re confident that security updates and protections in both Chrome and Android (operating systems) already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities. Our analysis is ongoing and we will implement any further necessary protections.\u201d One reason the investigation is focused on a potential leak by contractors rather than for example a hack by Russian intelligence, another official said, is that so far there is no evidence that Russian intelligence agencies tried to exploit any of the leaked material before it was published. One European official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the WikiLeaks material could in fact lead to closer cooperation between European intelligence agencies and U.S. counterparts, which share concerns about Russian intelligence operations. U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of seeking to tilt last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election in Trump\u2019s favor,  including by hacking into Democratic Party emails. Moscow has denied the allegation. One major security problem was that the number of contractors with access to information with the highest secrecy classification has \u201cexploded\u201d because of federal budget constraints, the first U.S. official said. U.S. intelligence agencies have been unable to hire additional permanent staff needed to keep pace with technological advances such as the \u201cinternet of things\u201d that connects cars, home security and heating systems and other devices to computer networks, or to pay salaries competitive with the private sector, the official said. Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents.  A person familiar with WikiLeaks\u2019 activities said the group has had the CIA hacking material for months, and that the release of the material was in the works \u201cfor a long time.\u201d In Germany on Wednesday, the chief federal prosecutor\u2019s office said that it would review the WikiLeaks documents because some suggested that the CIA ran a hacking hub from the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt. \u201cWe will initiate an investigation if we see evidence of concrete criminal acts or specific perpetrators,\u201d a spokesman for the federal prosecutor\u2019s office told Reuters. Chancellor Angela Merkel is scheduled to visit Washington on March 14 for her first meeting with Trump, who has sharply criticized Berlin for everything from its trade policy to what he considers inadequate levels of military spending.

        "title": "Democrats face uphill fight if Trump gets second U.S. high court pick",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If Democrats thought it was hard to stop President Donald Trump\u2019s first U.S. Supreme Court nominee, it promises to be even tougher for them if he gets to fill another vacancy, potentially to replace the most influential justice, Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sides with the court\u2019s liberals in key cases such as on gay rights and abortion, is one of three justices 78 or older. Justice Stephen Breyer is 78 and fellow liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 84. Former Kennedy Supreme Court clerks said the justice, who turns 81 in July, may be pondering retirement either this year or in 2018. That would give Trump a further chance to shape the court after his first nominee, Neil Gorsuch, was sworn in on Monday for the lifetime job to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia after overcoming fierce Democratic opposition in the Senate confirmation process. Kennedy administered Gorsuch\u2019s judicial oath at a White House ceremony, and Trump heaped praise on a justice who has spent nearly three decades on America\u2019s top court, calling him \u201ca great man of outstanding accomplishment.\u201d Gorsuch is one of Kennedy former clerks. Kennedy is planning a reunion of his clerks in June rather than next year as had been expected. Kennedy, through a court spokesman, declined to comment on his plans. The implications for the court if Kennedy were to step down are enormous. For the past decade he been its swing vote in major cases. Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation restored the court\u2019s 5-4 conservative majority. If whenever Kennedy leaves the bench he is replaced by a stalwart conservative, that would move the court further to the right. Republicans possess a 52-48 majority in the Senate. In order to secure Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation, they voted to prohibit a procedural roadblock called a filibuster that had required a super-majority of 60 votes to allow a confirmation vote for Supreme Court nominees, leaving the minority Democrats with little ammunition for the next nomination fight. \u201cI think it will be very hard for Democrats to get much traction to derail a future Trump nominee without the threat of a filibuster,\u201d George Washington University political scientist Sarah Binder said. But Democrats and Republicans still are predicting a fierce fight over the next court vacancy. \u201cFor the life of me I don\u2019t understand why the Democrats made such a fuss about this one. They look stupid,\u201d Republican Senator Orrin Hatch said last week of Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. \u201cI expect Armageddon on the next one because that\u2019s going to change, assuming Trump gets another one, the direction of the court. It would certainly keep the court in a more conservative mode for a long time.\u201d A Democratic congressional aide added, \u201cThe opposition to Gorsuch could look weak compared to what a similarly conservative nominee would face, if it would tip the balance on the court.\u201d  Kennedy is the longest-serving of the nine justices. He was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1987 and confirmed by the Senate in 1988 after Democrats thwarted Reagan\u2019s first choice, outspoken conservative Robert Bork, and his second pick, Douglas Ginsburg, withdrew from consideration. Although he has sided with his conservative colleagues on many issues, Kennedy has supported liberal causes such as gay rights, culminating in writing the landmark 2015 ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. He also joined the liberals in upholding abortion rights. In 2016, Kennedy joined the court\u2019s four liberal justices in a ruling striking down a Texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in the strongest endorsement of U.S. abortion rights in more than two decades. He also authored a 2016 ruling upholding the consideration of race in college admissions, joined by the court\u2019s liberals. University of Georgia School of Law professor Lori Ringhand said Republicans may be wary of defending an extremely conservative court nominee with the midterm congressional elections coming up in 2018, if another vacancy arises. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear it would be to the electoral advantage to Republicans to have a hotly contested Supreme Court nomination right before the midterms that highlighted a nominee\u2019s extremely conservative positions on social issues that the majority of the public have actually accepted,\u201d Ringhand said.

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of Democratic senators took their plans to tackle rising drug costs to President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday, asking him to work with them and Republicans on the issue. In a letter dated Tuesday, the 19 senators named five areas for cooperation: allowing the Medicare program to negotiate prescription prices, increasing transparency, stopping abusive pricing, passing reform on incentives for innovation and supporting generic competition for branded drugs. Trump\u2019s focus during the presidential election campaign was not on drug prices but on his promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obamacare, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health reform law passed by Democrats in 2010.  But he did talk about allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, which is currently prohibited by law, and importing cheaper drugs from other countries. Since elected, Trump promised in an interview with Time magazine that \u201cI\u2019m going to bring down drug prices\u201d but did not say how. In the letter led by Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Al Franken of Minnesota and co-signed by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren among others, the group suggested that there would be opportunities in Congress for Trump to steer bipartisan reform. It suggested that the Prescription Drug, Generic Drug, and Biosimilars User Fee Agreement reauthorization, due to be passed in the spring, and \u201cother health-related legislative priorities\u201d would be good opportunities.  Republicans have a majority in Congress and is working on a two-part plan to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obamacare, according to Republican senators. The repeal would take place through the budget reconciliation process, which can pass with 51 votes. For replacement legislation, some Republican senators have said they may seek Democratic support in order to have bipartisan legislation with 60 votes.    ",

        "text": "JAMESTOWN, St. Helena (Reuters) - One of humanity s most isolated outposts joined the 21st century on Saturday when the British island of St. Helena, home to  the world s most useless airport , welcomed its first commercial flight. As the inaugural plane from Johannesburg touched down on the forbidding volcanic outcrop in the middle of the south Atlantic, the travel and history buffs on board clapped and cheered.  I ve never felt so emotional in all my life,  said Libby Weir-Breen, a British travel operator who has been bringing tourists to the island, 1,200 miles (1,900 km) west of the African nation of Angola, for the last 12 years. She had flown in specially from Scotland to be on the plane, and dabbed away tears as it touched down on the spectacular cliff-side runway.  I never thought I d see this day,  she said.  The 4,500 people living on St. Helena, a British colony since 1658 - most famous as the windswept outpost where French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte breathed his last - might also be forgiven for thinking the day would never come. There has been talk of building an airport on St. Helena since the 1930s. The best site   one of the few flat spaces on the notoriously craggy island   was ruled out because of a nearby breeding ground for the wirebird, an endangered species of plover. An airport at the new site, on top of a valley filled in with 8 million cubic meters of rock, suffered numerous setbacks and delays as costs ballooned to 285 million pounds, to the horror of the British government. The runway and terminal were completed in 2016 but the official opening was pushed back another year after test flights were buffeted by wicked cross-winds, making it unsafe for large aircraft to use. With Britain mired in financial austerity, the London media were quick to condemn it as a white elephant, or  the world s most useless airport , with a price tag of more than 60,000 pounds for every Saint, as the island s residents are known. Before the opening of the airport, which will receive weekly flights to and from the South African commercial capital, the only way to St. Helena was a five-night voyage from Cape Town aboard the RMS St. Helena, a British postal ship. With the risk of wind-shear limiting the size of planes and numbers of passengers   Saturday s flight had room for 100 but only 68 on board due to weight restrictions   the hoped-for tourist boom is unlikely to materialize. Hotel capacity has jumped in the last few years from just a few dozen rooms to more than 100, but, with a maximum of 3,500 visitors a year, the island is unlikely to be weaned off the 53 million pounds it receives in aid every year from London. Besides Napoleon s old house, Longwood, and a cemetery holding some of the 6,000 Afrikaner prisoners sent there by the British during the Anglo-Boer wars in South Africa, St. Helena offers scuba diving and walking in pristine natural wildernesses. Governor Lisa Phillips dismissed the critics and said that even before it accepted its first commercial flight, the airport had proved its worth in the last 18 months by enabling several life-saving emergency medical evacuations, including a newborn child.  I ve seen the headlines about the world s most useless airport, but for St. Helenans this has already been the most useful airport,  she told reporters after greeting them on the tarmac.  It s priceless.  ",

        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - Fighting in Yemen s capital has intensified, with the known toll from three hospitals reaching at least 125 killed and 238 wounded in the past six days, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Monday. Saudi-led coalition warplanes struck at Houthi militia positions in Yemen s capital Sanaa for a second day on Monday in support of ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh, a former Houthi ally who has now renounced his alliance with the Iranian-backed group. Residents are trapped in their homes, many lacking provisions, with the sick, wounded and pregnant women often unable to reach hospitals, ICRC spokeswoman Iolanda Jaquemet said.  The ICRC supplies three large hospitals in the Yemeni capital - Al Thawra, Al Jumhouri and Al Kuwait - which urgently need kits for treating war-wounded, she said.   According to the hospitals we are in touch with, the clashes have claimed the lives of 125 people and wounded 238,   she said.  But due to the fighting, the agency cannot reach its medical warehouse in Sanaa which was hit overnight, but as far as it knows the kits and other goods have not been damaged, she added, declining to give more details about whether it was struck in an air strike or by another type of attack. She said they were looking at donating body bags to the hospitals, plus other supplies.  We hope to donate fuel to the main hospitals because they depend on generators and they are in urgent need of fuel because their stocks are being depleted at a time of the recent increase in the number of casualties,  Jaquemet said. Hospitals need electricity to perform surgeries and maintain the cold chain for drugs and vaccines, she said.  The ICRC  relocated  13 international staff to Djibouti from Sanaa on Monday, leaving about 199 staff in the city, including 21 expatriates, she said. The agency deploys about 425 staff in Yemen, including in Hodeida, Saada, Taiz and Aden, she said. U.N. and other aid officials said on Sunday that the United Nations was trying to evacuate at least 140 aid workers from the Yemeni capital amid fighting that had cut off the airport road, but awaited approval from the Saudi-led coalition.

        "title": "Kaspersky says it obtained suspected NSA hacking code from U.S. computer",
        "text": " SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Moscow-based antivirus software maker Kaspersky Lab said on Wednesday that its security software had taken source code for a secret American hacking tool from a personal computer in the United States.  In September, U.S. officials ordered Kaspersky\u2019s products removed from government computers, saying the firm was vulnerable to Kremlin influence and that using the software could jeopardize national security.  After that announcement, the Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 5 that hackers working for the Russian government appeared to have targeted a National Security Agency (NSA) worker by using Kaspersky software to identify classified files in 2015. The New York Times reported on Oct. 10 that Israeli officials reported the operation to the United States after they hacked into Kaspersky's network.  The Russian government has denied any involvement.  Kaspersky began an internal inquiry in a bid to restore trust. On Wednesday, it said it had stumbled on the code in 2014 when the consumer version of its popular software flagged a zip file as malicious on a U.S. computer.  While reviewing the file\u2019s contents, a Kaspersky analyst discovered it contained the source code for a hacking tool later attributed to what Kaspersky calls the Equation Group. The software removed the file and the analyst reported the matter to Chief Executive Eugene Kaspersky, who ordered that the copy of the code be destroyed, the company said.  Kaspersky said it assumed the 2014 source code episode was connected to the NSA\u2019s loss of files described in media reports.  \u201cWe deleted the archive because we don\u2019t need the source code to improve our protection technologies and because of concerns regarding the handling of classified materials,\u201d said Kaspersky spokeswoman Sarah Kitsos.  Source code, which is normally hidden and gives instructions to computers, would have posed no danger to the Kaspersky customer.  Former employees told Reuters in July that the company had on rare occasions removed uninfected files. Kaspersky spokeswoman Yuliya Shlychkova on Wednesday said removals of such uninfected material happen \u201cextremely rarely.\u201d  Kaspersky said no third parties saw the code, though the media reports said the spy tool had ended up in the hands of the Russian government.  Kaspersky denied the Journal\u2019s report that its programs searched for keywords including \u201ctop secret.\u201d  The company said it found no evidence that it had been hacked by Russian spies or anyone except the Israelis, though it suggested others could have obtained the tools by hacking into the American\u2019s computer through a back door it later spotted there.  The NSA declined to comment on Kaspersky\u2019s review.  The new 2014 date of the incident is of interest because Kaspersky only announced its discovery of an espionage campaign by the Equation Group in February 2015. At that time, Reuters cited former NSA employees who said that Equation Group was an NSA project.  Kaspersky\u2019s Equation Group report was one of its most celebrated findings, since it indicated that the group could infect firmware on most computers. That gave the NSA almost undetectable presence.  Shlychkova said the American machine\u2019s files were found before the big Equation Group announcement but after Kaspersky had discovered Equation software on a machine in the Middle East. She said that occurred in March 2014.  Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who led calls in the U.S. Congress to purge Kaspersky products from federal government networks, on Wednesday sent a letter to DHS acting Secretary Elaine Duke and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, urging the U.S. government to declassify information about Kaspersky products.  The step was necessary, Shaheen wrote, \u201cto allow the American people to make informed decisions about risks to their privacy and security.\u201d  Also on Tuesday, Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill sent a separate letter to DHS asking what was being done to ensure federal agencies were complying with the ban on Kaspersky products.  Kaspersky\u2019s consumer anti-virus software has won high marks from reviewers.  The company said Monday it would submit the source code of its software and future updates for inspection by independent parties.  ",

        "title": "Cubans sold everything to reach U.S., now hundreds stranded",
        "text": "PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Hundreds of Cubans who sold their homes and belongings in pursuit of an American dream that now lays in tatters were stranded in Central America and Mexico on Friday after Washington abruptly ended a lenient immigration policy. U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday repealed a measure granting automatic residency to virtually every Cuban who  arrived in the United States, whether or not they had visas, ending a longstanding exception to U.S. policy. The end of the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy, which allowed any Cuban who reached U.S. soil to stay, but returned any picked up at sea, took effect immediately. Cuban officials had long sought the change, arguing it would discourage people-trafficking and dangerous journeys. Jose Enrique Manreza, who sold his house and possessions in Havana to embark on a epic trip by plane, bus and foot through the rain forests of French Guiana, Colombia and Panama, estimated he had spent about $10,000 on the journey.   \u201cImagine how I feel, after I spent six days and six nights running through rivers and jungles in the humidity,\u201d said Manreza, at a migrant shelter in the southern Mexican city of Tapachula, where he heard the news, along with 30 other Cubans. In Honduras, 75 Cubans were waiting to move on to Mexico and the U.S. border. In Panama, another 75 gathered in the tree-shaded patio of the Caritas shelter in the capital. Many had sold everything they owned to pay for the voyage of a lifetime. Some said hundreds more were still traversing the treacherous forests of the Darien region bordering Colombia. Some expressed dismay that Obama, who is popular in Cuba for punching holes in the U.S. economic embargo and reinstating diplomatic relations, had taken a measure they saw as hurting ordinary Cubans. \u201cObama\u2019s decision is killing our dreams,\u201d said Yancys Riccart, 25, a teaching assistant, who said her journey took her through Guyana, Brazil, Ecuador and Colombia. She said she was worried she would be mistreated or not given work by Cuban authorities if she went back home. Victor Berrios, a deacon for Roman Catholic charity Caritas, urged the migrants not to rush into the hands of people-traffickers to reach the United States, reminding them that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could reinstate the law when he assumes the presidency on Jan 20. \u201cBe patient, we know that from the 20th there will be another government. Do not lose hope. Have faith,\u201d Berrios said.  Washington has unveiled a flurry of last minute agreements to try to prevent Trump reversing the 2014 detente with Cuba, one of Obama\u2019s flagship policies.  Trump has said he would scrap Obama\u2019s Cuba policy unless the Cubans presented a better deal, but it was not immediately clear if he would try to bring back \u201cwet-foot, dry-foot.\u201d Anticipating the end of the policy, Cuban immigration has surged since the 2014 normalization. Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser, said some 40,000 Cubans arrived in the United States in 2015 and about 54,000 in 2016. Thousands of Cubans gathered in Costa Rica and Panama last year as Central American countries struggled to cope with the influx. El Salvador welcomed the new policy, saying all immigrants should be treated equally.  Honduras, a source of thousands of immigrants to the United States each year, despite no Cuban-style special treatment, said it was waiting to see if the policy led to fewer Cubans traveling. Mexico\u2019s foreign ministry had no immediate comment. Manreza said his wife, a nurse, was working in Venezuela as part of a Cuban oil-for-doctors program. Obama also rolled back a \u201cmedical parole\u201d program dating back to 2006 that allowed Cuban doctors working in third countries to move to the United States simply by walking into a U.S. embassy. \u201cShe cried when I called her,\u201d he said, without indicating whether she had intended to defect under the program.  Manreza, who ran a soda warehouse in Havana before he left in December with his daughter, said he was deciding whether to return to Cuba, broke, or seek asylum in Mexico.  Ivan Diaz, 45, a health administrator, said he had no intention of turning back. He left Cuba three months ago with his wife. He said the dash for the United States had cost about $25,000 for him, his wife and Miami family members who sent money to support them.  \u201cI\u2019ve got $10 left in my pocket,\u201d said Diaz at the Tapachula center. \u201cWe are going to carry on. We don\u2019t lose anything by going to the Laredo border. We must be able to do something. Otherwise, let them deport me back to Cuba.\u201d ",

        "title": "Ryan says Republicans should follow 'conscience' on Trump",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers should follow their conscience on whether to support Donald Trump in November\u2019s presidential election, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said in an interview, reflecting the party\u2019s unease over its White House candidate.  \u201cThe last thing I would do is tell anybody to do something that\u2019s contrary to their conscience. Of course I wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d the Republicans\u2019 most senior elected official said in excerpts released on Friday of an NBC interview set to air on Sunday.  Some Republican leaders and lawmakers in the House of Representatives are struggling to get behind the New York businessman, who last month became the party\u2019s presumptive nominee for the Nov. 8 election. After an initial delay, Ryan has said he will back Trump but he has also acknowledged deep differences with him. He denounced as textbook racism Trump\u2019s criticism of a Mexican-American judge and has also criticized Trump\u2019s proposal - reiterated after the  massacre of 49 people in a gay bar in Orlando on Sunday - to temporarily bar Muslims from the United States. As Republicans seek to keep control of both chambers of Congress, Trump\u2019s comments on such issues have also worried some lawmakers concerned about their own election prospects, particularly in close races. All 247 House Republican seats are up for grabs in the election. Trump, who has welcomed support from Ryan, this week fired back at Republican leaders, telling them to stop speaking out against him or else risk him potentially running \u201cby myself.\u201d Ryan said earlier this week at his weekly press conference that he does not plan to withdraw his support of Trump, although they disagree on some key issues.  \u201cI feel as a responsibility institutionally as the speaker of the House that I should not be leading some chasm in the middle of our party. Because you know what I know that\u2019ll do? That\u2019ll definitely knock us out of the White House,\u201d Ryan said in the interview for NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d program. Trump\u2019s embrace this week of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and potential gun control measures, in contrast to general Republican orthodoxy have also thrown conservative lawmakers.  Still, Republican leaders have to reconcile their unease with the fact that primary Republican voters opted for Trump. He has never held elected office before but won more than enough delegates to secure the party\u2019s nomination at the Republican convention in July.  ",

        "title": "Turkey, Iran and Russia to deploy observers around Syria's Idlib",
        "text": "ANKARA/ASTANA (Reuters) - Russia, Iran and Turkey will post observers on the edge of a de-escalation zone in northern Syria s Idlib region largely controlled by Islamist militants, the three nations said on Friday. The move is part of a broader plan under which Moscow, Tehran and Ankara will set up four such zones in different parts of Syria, an idea described by critics as de facto partitioning of the war-torn nation. While they hailed the agreement as a breakthrough after months of talks, Moscow, Tehran and Ankara provided very few details and said some issues were still to be worked out. They denied charges of aiming to partition the country, however, saying the zones where they plan to deploy forces would be temporary, although they could be extended beyond an initial six-month term. A top aide to President Bashar al-Assad, Bouthaina Shaaban, said attempts to divide Syria had failed, and reiterated the government s vow to take back the entire country, including  Idlib and other areas . Turkey s foreign ministry and Russian and Iranian diplomats who attended trilateral talks in Kazakhstan said on Friday their observers would be stationed in  safe zones  along the border of the Idlib de-escalation area. The Turkish ministry said in a statement the observers  mission will be to prevent clashes between  the (Syrian) regime and the opposition forces, and any violations of the truce . Russian negotiator Alexander Lavrentyev said the trio will each send about 500 observers to Idlib, and the Russians will be military policemen. Idlib province, in northwest Syria on the border with Turkey, is largely controlled by a rebel alliance spearheaded by the former al Qaeda offshoot Nusra Front. One analyst was unsure how effective the deal would be.  I m not sure what this deal means in practice or how or if it is going to get implemented on the ground,  said Aron Lund, a Syria specialist and fellow at The Century Foundation.  The obvious stumbling block is the fact that much of Idlib is under the control of Tahrir al-Sham, which is viewed internationally as a terrorist group.      A deal with Russia and Iran, which support President Bashar Assad s government, marks a shift in the policy of Ankara, which backs some of the rebels and raised objections to Russia and Iran s proposals at a previous meeting in July. But the details of the plan remained unclear as the three countries did not make public any of the documents agreed on Friday apart from their joint statement. Russia s Lavrentyev said that the exact deployment locations of de-escalation control forces in Idlib had yet to be determined. Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Centre, said the agreement could pave way for an offensive against Hay at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).  The calls to form a  unified opposition army  in the northwest under the aegis of groups close to the Muslim Brotherhood suggest that Turkey is preparing a proxy force to move against HTS in western Aleppo and Idlib: as in al-Bab and Jarablus, Turkish units would support opposition forces from behind,  he said. A Western diplomat said it was  still unclear what the final outcome will be, notwithstanding there was just a closing ceremony .  How much devil will be in the detail remains to be seen,  the diplomat said. Meanwhile, the Astana trio have started discussing setting up national reconciliation committees in Syria and will continue those discussions in late October, Lavrentyev said. The United Nations, which hosts separate Syria peace talks in Geneva, has previously urged Astana to focus on consolidating the ceasefire and avoid political matters. ",

        "title": "If threatened, U.S. will 'totally destroy' North Korea, Trump vows",
        "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump escalated his standoff with North Korea over its nuclear challenge on Tuesday, threatening to  totally destroy  the country of 26 million people and mocking its leader, Kim Jong Un, as a  rocket man.  In a hard-edged speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Trump offered a grim portrait of a world in peril, adopted a more confrontational approach to solving global challenges from Iran to Venezuela, and gave an unabashed defense of U.S. sovereignty.   The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,  Trump told the 193-member world body, sticking closely to a script.  As loud, startled murmurs filled the hall, Trump described Kim in an acid tone, saying,  Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and his regime.  His remarks rattled world leaders gathered in the green-marbled General Assembly hall, where minutes earlier U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed for statesmanship, saying:  We must not sleepwalk our way into war.  Trump s most direct military threat to attack North Korea, in his debut appearance at the General Assembly, was his latest expression of concern about Pyongyang s repeated launching of ballistic missiles over Japan and underground nuclear tests. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom crossed her arms during the speech.  It was the wrong speech, at the wrong time, to the wrong audience,  Wallstrom later told the BBC. A junior North Korean diplomat sat in the delegation s front-row seat for Trump s speech, the North Korean U.N. mission said. The mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would do everything in her power to ensure a diplomatic solution.  Anything else would lead to disaster,  she said. Trump s saber-rattling rhetoric, with the bare-knuckled style he used to win election last November, was in contrast to the comments of some of his own Cabinet members who have stated a preference for a diplomatic solution. Defense Secretary James Mattis, who earlier this month raised the prospect of a  massive military response  if needed, on Tuesday told Pentagon reporters that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was working to resolve the crisis diplomatically. Interviewed by Fox News, Tillerson highlighted Washington s policy of pressuring North Korea through sanctions.  We have the strictest sanctions ever put in place. We do believe there are early signs of those having an effect,  he said.  Ultimately though we re going to need the assistance of the neighbors in the region.     Reaction in the United States to Trump s speech was mixed. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, tweeted that Trump, a fellow Republican,  gave a strong and needed challenge  to U.N. members to confront global challenges. But Democrat Ed Markey of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee denounced Trump s remarks, telling CNN the president had yet to exhaust his other options in encouraging Pyongyang to negotiate. In a thunderous speech, 42 minutes long according to the official transcript, Trump took aim at Iran s nuclear ambitions and regional influence, Venezuela s collapsing democracy and the threat of Islamist extremists.  Major portions of the world are in conflict and some in fact are going to hell,  he said. His speech recalled the fiery nationalist language of his Jan. 20 inaugural address when he pledged to end what he called an  American carnage  of rusted factories and crime. His strongest words were directed at North Korea. He urged U.N. member states to work together to isolate the Kim government until it ceases its  hostile  behavior. In an apparent prod at China, the North s major trading partner, Trump said:  It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime but would arm, supply and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict.  The U.N. Security Council has unanimously imposed nine  rounds of sanctions on North Korea since 2006 and Guterres appealed for that 15-member body to maintain its unity. Turning to Iran, Trump called the 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama, an embarrassment and hinted that he may not recertify the agreement when it comes up for a mid-October deadline.  We cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program,  he said. He said the Iranian government  masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy.  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted a withering response:  Trump s ignorant hate speech belongs in medieval times - not the 21st Century UN - unworthy of a reply. Fake empathy for Iranians fools no one.  French President Emmanuel Macron, in his U.N. speech, said his country would not close the door to negotiations over North Korea and staunchly defended the Iran nuclear deal.  Renouncing it would be a grave error,  Macron said. Trump called the collapsing situation in Venezuela  completely unacceptable  and warned the United States was considering what further actions it can take.  We cannot stand by and watch,  he said. Venezuela rejected Trump s threats and said it was prepared to resist any U.S. actions, even a military invasion. At what was billed as an  anti-imperialist  rally in Caracas, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro described Trump as  the new Hitler of international politics.  Stocks, bonds and currency markets ended little changed on the day.  I think world markets have become complacent about North Korea,  said Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners. ",

        "title": "Factbox: Merkel's conservatives, SPD set out policy lines for German coalition",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Momentum in Germany is building for a new  grand coalition  between Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservative bloc and the Social Democrats (SPD) to end the political instability created by the collapse of her coalition talks with other parties. The conservatives and SPD have ruled together for the last four years and most ministers are keeping their posts in an interim government until a new coalition or minority government is formed. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier hosts a first meeting of Merkel, the head of Bavaria s CSU conservatives, Horst Seehofer, and SPD leader Martin Schulz on Thursday.  Here are some of the overlaps and differences in policy areas likely to be discussed in any coalition talks. Merkel has stressed she wants to maintain Germany s solid finances. Germany has run a budget surplus since 2014 under the stewardship of her hardline conservative finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble. She has also said she wants some tax cuts, mainly for low and medium earners.  The SPD is far more focused on boosting spending and has in the last few days said it wants to increase investment in education and homes as well as on infrastructure. The SPD wants to increase inheritance tax, some in the party want to insist on raising the minimum wage and it fought the election on a pledge of keeping pensions stable.  The conservatives and SPD both want to increase spending to expand broadband.  An area of possible conflict. Since the election, Merkel has bowed to pressure from her Bavarian allies to put a cap on the number of people Germany will accept on humanitarian grounds. Merkel repeated on Saturday that she wanted to limit the number to about 200,000 a year.  The SPD opposes this, arguing it breaches the constitution s guarantee of asylum to people who are persecuted for political reasons. Some leading party members have said they will not agree to a cap. The SPD is more positive than Merkel s cautious stance towards French President Emmanuel Macron s proposals for a euro zone budget and a euro zone finance minister. The SPD also backs the idea of turning the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund along the lines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  There is little difference on approach to Brexit talks. Broad agreement on most areas of foreign policy, including with the United States and Turkey. The SPD puts greater emphasis on mending ties with Russia which have been hurt by the conflict in Ukraine, but this is more a matter of nuance than a deep policy rift. Also agreement on armed forces missions abroad although the SPD is more skeptical on NATO demands to move towards increasing defense spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product by 2014. The SPD fought its election on the platform of social justice and wants to improve the lot of the less affluent. A long-standing commitment which several senior SPD members have repeated recently is the idea of making health insurance fairer for everyone by introducing a  citizen s insurance . The SPD also wants to ensure men and women have equal pay and working conditions.  ",

        "title": "U.S. warns North Korea of 'overwhelming' response if nuclear arms used",
        "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s defense secretary warned North Korea on Friday of an \u201ceffective and overwhelming\u201d response if it chose to use nuclear weapons, as he reassured South Korea of steadfast U.S. support. \u201cAny attack on the United States, or our allies, will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons would be met with a response that would be effective and overwhelming,\u201d Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said at South Korea\u2019s defense ministry, at the end of a two-day visit. Mattis\u2019 remarks come amid concern that North Korea could be readying to test a new ballistic missile, in what could be an early challenge for Trump\u2019s administration. North Korea, which regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and its main ally, the United States, conducted more than 20 missile tests last year, as well as two nuclear tests, in defiance of U.N. resolutions and sanctions. The North also appears to have also restarted operation of a reactor at its main Yongbyon nuclear facility that produces plutonium that can be used for its nuclear weapons program, according to the U.S. think-tank 38 North. \u201cNorth Korea continues to launch missiles, develop its nuclear weapons program and engage in threatening rhetoric and behavior,\u201d Mattis said. North Korea\u2019s actions have prompted the United States and South Korea to respond by bolstering defenses, including the expected deployment of a U.S. missile defense system, known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), in South Korea later this year.  The two sides reconfirmed that commitment on Friday. China, however, has objected to THAAD, saying it is a direct threat to China\u2019s own security and will do nothing to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table, leading to calls from some South Korean opposition leaders to delay or cancel it. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang reiterated China\u2019s opposition, which he said would never change. \u201cWe do not believe this move will be conducive to resolving the Korean peninsula nuclear issue or to maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula,\u201d Lu told a daily news briefing in Beijing.  South Korean Defense Minister Han Min-koo said Mattis\u2019 visit to Seoul - his first trip abroad as defense secretary - sent a clear message of strong U.S. support. \u201cFaced with a current severe security situation, Secretary Mattis\u2019 visit to Korea ... also communicates the strongest warning to North Korea,\u201d Han said.  Once fully developed, a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) could threaten the continental United States, which is about 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or more. Former U.S. officials and other experts have said the United States essentially has two options when it comes to trying to curb North Korea\u2019s fast-expanding nuclear and missile programs - negotiate or take military action. Neither path offers certain success and the military option is fraught with huge dangers, especially for Japan and South Korea, U.S. allies in close proximity to North Korea. Mattis is due in Japan later on Friday. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, one of the leaders of the \u201cbirther\u201d movement that questioned President Barack Obama\u2019s U.S. citizenship, believes Obama was born in the United States, the Trump campaign said in a statement on Thursday. In an interview with the Washington Post released earlier in the day, Trump declined to say whether he believed Obama was born in Hawaii. \u201cI\u2019ll answer that question at the right time. I just don\u2019t want to answer it yet,\u201d Trump told the newspaper. Those comments drew criticism from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who expressed dismay at Trump\u2019s response during remarks to a gathering of Hispanic leaders in Washington. \u201cHe still wouldn\u2019t say Hawaii. He still wouldn\u2019t say America. This man wants to be our next president?\u201d Clinton said.  \u201cWhen will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry? Now he\u2019s tried to reset himself and his campaign many times. This is the best he can do. This is who he is,\u201d she said. A few years into his presidency, Obama, the first African American to win the White House, released a longer version of his birth certificate to answer those who suggested he was not U.S. born. \u201cIn 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate,\u201d Trump senior communications advisor Jason Miller said in a statement late on Thursday. \u201cHaving successfully obtained President Obama\u2019s birth certificate when others could not, Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States,\u201d he said. Trump has been trying to drum up support among black voters, who overwhelmingly supported Obama in his 2008 and 2012 elections. Many African Americans object to Trump\u2019s involvement in the \u201cbirther\u201d movement and the implication that Obama\u2019s presidency was illegitimate. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON/ANKARA (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Monday it was reviewing  adjustments  in arms for the Syrian Kurdish forces that have angered Turkey, but it stopped short of halting weapons transfers, suggesting such decisions would be based on battlefield requirements.  Turkey said on Friday U.S. President Donald Trump told President Tayyip Erdogan he had issued instructions that weapons should not be provided to the Syrian Kurdish fighters, which Ankara views as threat.  We are reviewing pending adjustments to the military support provided to our Kurdish partners in as much as the military requirements of our defeat-ISIS and stabilization efforts will allow to prevent ISIS from returning,  said Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon, referring to Islamic State, which U.S. and U.S.-backed forces are battling in Syria. Earlier on Monday Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said Friday s call between Trump and Erdogan was a turning point in strained ties between the two countries, but Washington must honor a pledge to stop providing weapons to the Syrian Kurds.  The  We will not give weapons  remark from a U.S. president for the first time is important, but it will lose value if it is not implemented. It would be deceiving the world,  Bozdag said. The Syrian Kurdish YPG spearheads the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias fighting Islamic State with the help of a U.S.-led coalition. A spokesperson for the coalition said on Sunday that it was looking at  adjustments  to the support it provides to the SDF, ranging from the number of advisers to training and artillery. Weapons provided to Syrian YPG have been limited and mission specific, the spokesperson added. Ankara has been infuriated by Washington s support for the YPG militia, seen by Turkey as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey and is designated a terrorist group by Ankara, the United States and European Union.

        "text": "CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia is trying to move asylum seekers held in one of its two remote Pacific detention centers to the second camp, a notice seen by Reuters shows, as Canberra seeks a way to close one down. Men held on Papua New Guinea s Manus Island can move to the center on the tiny island nation of Nauru if they have been awarded refugee status and are being considered for U.S. resettlement, the letter posted in the camp and seen by Reuters shows.  Refugees in the United States process can now apply for transfer to Nauru,  the letter read. The Manus camp only holds men. The letter marks Australia s latest attempt to empty the Manus center, which is scheduled to close on Oct. 31. Under Canberra s hardline immigration policy, asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia are sent for processing at the Manus and Nauru camps. They are told they will never be settled in Australia. More than 20 men left to be resettled in the United States last month, the first part of a refugee swap between the Washington and Canberra which U.S. President Donald Trump has branded a  dumb deal . But nearly 800 remain in the Manus camp and nearly all are refusing to move to a nearby transit center, citing fears for their safety.  The refugees have not left the detention center despite the government s efforts to push them out in the past few months,  said Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist held on Manus. Many have been awarded refugee status and are eligible for U.S resettlement under the deal Australia secured with former U.S. president Barack Obama late last year.  The United States will resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held on PNG and Nauru. In exchange, Australia agreed to take several dozen Central American refugees. Australia will begin resettling several dozen Central American refugees within weeks. Any transfer will further strain conditions on Nauru, where more than 1,200 men, women and children have been for four years in a camp widely criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups for abuses, including sexual abuse, and self-harming.

The June 27-July 1 poll showed a 9.4 percentage point lead for the former secretary of state over the New York businessman, down slightly from an 11.2 point lead in a previous five-day poll that ended on June 28. Clinton had maintained a double-digit lead in the rolling poll since June 20, as she recovered from a brief boost in Trump\u2019s numbers in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, when he renewed a call for a ban on Muslim immigration. Among likely voters, 43.9 percent now support Clinton, compared with 34.5 percent for Trump. Another 21.7 percent of likely voters wouldn\u2019t support either candidate. Clinton is more popular among men and women, young people and minorities, college graduates, and people who live on incomes that are both lower and higher than the national average. Trump has an edge among whites, people with lower levels of education, older Americans and retirees, and he leads among people who frequently attend church. Overall, voters have increasingly sided with Clinton since mid-May, when the two were about even in the poll.  Trump is expected officially to become the Republican presidential nominee when the party holds its convention in another 2-1/2 weeks. Clinton is expected to become the Democratic nominee when the Democrats hold their convention a week later. The poll, which included responses from 1,080 likely voters, has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.5 percentage points. Clinton\u2019s lead had widened to as much as 14 percentage points in the past two weeks as Republican leaders criticized Trump for his opposition to international trade agreements and a string of nativist comments about Hipsanics and Muslims. Clinton\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, has been dogged by allegations that she mishandled classified emails and failed to protect U.S. diplomats in Libya while secretary of state in Obama\u2019s first administration.

Odebrecht has admitted to paying millions of dollars in bribes to officials in Peru over a decade-long period, and lawmakers want the financial constraints written to keep Odebrecht from evading payment of fines for bribery to apply to the companies it partnered with.

The legislation would restrict international asset transfers and the right to seize  ill gotten gains  of Grana and other Odebrecht partners. However, none of Odebrecht s local partners have been convicted of any crimes and deny taking part in Odebrecht s bribes. Grana, Peru s biggest construction group and Odebrecht s most important local partner, saw its shares drop nearly 23 percent to 2.4 soles ( 0.5573) after passage of the legislation. Grana did not immediately respond to requests for comment but has criticized the bill as unconstitutional and promised to take legal action if it becomes law. Lawmakers who back the legislation have said Odebrecht s partners likely had a hand in Odebrecht s kickback schemes and that prosecutors were working too slowly in finding other guilty parties. Grana is under investigation in the attorney general s office but has not been charged with any crime and has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Araoz added that the government is planning to ask Congress for special legislative powers to make tax collection more efficient. However, she said the changes would be minor and ruled out any changes to tax rates. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House expressed confidence on Monday that Saudi Arabia would not follow through on a reported threat to sell U.S. assets if Congress passed a bill that could hold the kingdom responsible for any role in al Qaeda\u2019s Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The New York Times reported on Friday that Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told U.S. lawmakers that the country would be forced to sell up to $750 billion in Treasury securities and other U.S. assets in response to the bill if it passed. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama did not support the legislation and would not sign it. The bill would allow the Saudi government to be sued in a U.S. court for any role in the Sept. 11 attacks.  \u201cI\u2019m confident that the Saudis recognize, just as much as we do, our shared interest in preserving the stability of the global financial system,\u201d Earnest told reporters. Obama, who is traveling to Saudi Arabia later this week, said he opposes the bill because it could expose the United States to lawsuits from citizens of other countries.  \u201cIf we open up the possibility that individuals in the United States can routinely start suing other governments, then we are also opening up the United States to being continually sued by individuals in other countries,\u201d Obama said in an interview broadcast on CBS News on Monday. Most of the 19 attackers on Sept. 11, 2001 were Saudi nationals who hijacked four planes and flew them into New York City\u2019s World Trade Center, the Pentagon near Washington and into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers revolted. The attack was mounted by the al Qaeda militant group, then based in Afghanistan. No U.S. investigation to date has reported finding evidence of Saudi government support for the attacks. The debate over the congressional legislation has gained traction on the U.S. presidential campaign trail. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has broken with the Democratic administration and said she supported the bill. Her rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said he shared the Obama administration\u2019s concern that the legislation could open up the United States to liability from other countries but said it was important to look into any potential Saudi role in the attacks. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to have a full investigation and an understanding of the role, the possible role, of the Saudi government in 9/11,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d program. Clinton and Sanders\u2019 remarks on the issue on Monday came on the day before New York state\u2019s Democratic primary, a crucial race for both candidates. Businessman Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner in the race for the White House, dismissed concerns about a Saudi sell-off of U.S. assets. \u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d Trump told New York radio show host Joe Piscopo in a phone interview on Monday morning. \u201cLet\u2019em sell \u2018em. And we\u2019ll all buy them, Joe, that\u2019s OK. ... It\u2019s called a fire sale, nothing better than a fire sale.\u201d The bill, which has 22 co-sponsors, passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, but it has not come up for a vote in the Republican-dominated Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office said on Monday that no vote has been scheduled. Family members of victims who were killed in the September 2001 attacks urged Obama to support the legislation and to bring up the issue on his trip. \u201cIt is not acceptable ... to succumb to the demands of a foreign government that we abandon principles of American justice while we pursue our diplomatic goals,\u201d they wrote in a letter to Obama that was released to the media. In September, a U.S. judge dismissed claims against Saudi Arabia by families of victims of the attacks, saying the kingdom had sovereign immunity from damage claims. ",

        "title": "Republicans make gains in U.S. governors' races",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Republicans in Missouri, Vermont and New Hampshire won competitive governor\u2019s races on Tuesday, though most of the 12 contests left power in the hands of the incumbent party. Here are the results. In one of the year\u2019s closest gubernatorial races, Republican former Navy SEAL Eric Greitens edged Democrat Chris Koster, the state\u2019s attorney general. Greitens will succeed Governor Jay Nixon, a Democrat who has served the maximum two terms in office. Vermont elected a Republican, Lieutenant Governor Phil Scott, over Democrat Sue Minter, a former state transportation secretary. Scott succeeds retiring Governor Peter Shumlin, a Democrat. Democratic Governor Kate Brown held off a challenge by Republican Bud Pierce, an oncologist. Brown was sworn in last year after her predecessor, John Kitzhaber, resigned in scandal. The election is for the final two years of Kitzhaber\u2019s term. Republican Eric Holcomb, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, beat Democrat John Gregg, a former state lawmaker. Holcomb entered the race after current Governor Mike Pence opted not to seek re-election in July when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump chose him as his vice presidential running mate. Democratic businessman Jim Justice defeated Republican state Senate President Bill Cole. Democratic Governor Earl Ray Tomblin was barred by term limits from running again.  Incumbent Governor Gary Herbert, a Republican, won his re-election race against Democrat Mike Weinholtz, a healthcare executive. Herbert, who took office in 2009 after his predecessor, Jon Huntsman, resigned, won a second full term.  Republican Doug Burgum, a former Microsoft Corp executive, defeated Democratic State Representative Marvin Nelson in the solidly Republican state. Governor Jack Dalrymple, a Republican who was eligible to run for re-election in 2016, declined to seek another term. Democrat John Carney, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, beat Republican Colin Bonini, a state senator. Democratic Governor Jack Markell was prohibited by term limits from running for re-election to the position he has held since 2009. Drawing national attention because of a debate over transgender rights, Republican Governor Pat McCrory is seeking a second term against Roy Cooper, a Democrat who has been the state\u2019s attorney general since 2001. Cooper held a razor-thin lead as of Wednesday morning. McCrory told supporters tallying an unknown number of provisional ballots could take until Nov. 18. Democratic Governor\u00a0Steve Bullock is battling Republican tech entrepreneur Greg Gianforte to keep his seat. The race remained too close to call on Wednesday morning. Republican Chris Sununu defeated Democrat Colin Van Ostern to become the state\u2019s next governor. Both candidates had been seeking to succeed Democratic Governor Maggie Hassan, who is running for the U.S. Senate. Democratic Governor Jay Inslee defeated a challenge from Republican Bill Bryant, a businessman and former commissioner of the Port of Seattle. ",

        "text": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Four supporters of Yemen s former president Ali Abdullah Saleh were killed in clashes with their supposed allies from the Houthi movement in the center of the capital Sanaa on Wednesday, his party said. The fighting around the city s main mosque complex underlined deepening rifts between the armed groups who have together confronted a Saudi-led alliance in three years of war. Houthi fighters and army units loyal to Saleh made common cause to fan out through Yemen in 2015 and have weathered thousands of air strikes launched by neighboring Saudi Arabia and its allies. But they have fought between themselves briefly once before in August and have vied for influence in the capital and Yemen s main population centers over which they rule.  In an official statement, Saleh s General People s Congress Party accused Houthi forces of trying to occupy part of the mosque site on Wednesday for a coming political rally. Hundreds of Houthi fighters, the statement said,  broke into the Saleh Mosque and fired RPGs and grenades inside the mosque and put its regular guards under siege.      They said four of Saleh s supporters died and six guards were wounded in the complex built by Saleh and bearing his name which straddles a major highway and is close to the presidential palace. The Houthis, the statement said, were  responsible for every drop of blood.  Officials from the Houthi group were not immediately available to comment on the reports of gunbattles, which were also reported in Arab media. The two allies were once bitter foes, as Saleh launched several wars on the armed Shi ite Muslim religious movement before 2011  Arab Spring  protests forced him to step down. They formed a partnership to fight the Saudi-backed and internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his forces. A political body the allies established continues to rule over most of Yemen s population centers but quarrels over appointments and policy have mounted as a Saudi-led blockade has spread economic pain and helped unleash hunger and disease. Taha Mutawakil, a Houthi spiritual leader, in a Friday sermon blasted Saleh s rule as  black days  for Yemen and called for the Houthis to declare an economic state of emergency and seize the assets of Saleh-aligned businessmen. The movement s leader, Abdulmalik al-Houthi, appeared to direct an unprecedented salvo at pro-Saleh officials in a speech on Saturday:  He who does not understand the concept of alliance and partnership, is an obstacle and knows only how to be a rival.  For their part, Saleh s General People s Congress party referred to pro-Houthi fighters as  cartoonish mercenary things  in an earlier statement. Saudi Arabia accuses the Houthis, as Saleh frequently did before their alliance, of being proxies of Shi ite Iran - a charge the group and Tehran deny. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Monday the United States would be \u201ctweaking\u201d its trade relationship with Canada, stopping short of calling for a major realignment in a development likely to please visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump has pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA) linking the economies of the United States, Mexico and Canada to make the terms more favorable to Americans. At a joint news conference with Trudeau after White House talks, Trump said his biggest concern with NAFTA was the U.S. trade relationship with Mexico, which he has frequently accused of stealing American jobs. \u201cWe have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada. We\u2019ll be tweaking it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a much less severe situation than what\u2019s taking place on the southern border. On the southern border, for many, many years the transaction was not fair to the United States,\u201d he said. Trump said the United States and Canada were stronger when they joined forces in matters of international commerce, and both countries benefited from having more jobs and trade in North America. \u201cWe should coordinate closely - and we will coordinate closely - to protect jobs in our hemisphere and keep wealth on our continent, and to keep everyone safe,\u201d Trump said. Trudeau carefully steered around questions about the Canadian trade relationship with the United States in what was his first meeting with the new president. He said he expected each country to always remain each other\u2019s most essential partner. \u201cThere have been times where we have differed in our approaches and that\u2019s always been done firmly and respectfully. The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves,\u201d Trudeau said. Trump\u2019s vow to renegotiate NAFTA has unnerved Canadian officials, even though he has singled out Mexico in his criticism of the free trade deal. Canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States. Canadians have become more supportive of NAFTA since Trump\u2019s election victory on Nov. 8, a poll from the Angus Reid Institute showed on Monday. Forty-four percent of the 1,508 surveyed said NAFTA had benefited Canada, up from 25 percent from a poll last June. Trudeau, when asked about Canadian firms\u2019 concerns about possible changes to NAFTA, said: \u201cIt is a real concern for many Canadians because we know our economy is very dependent on our relationship with the United States. \u201cGoods and services do cross the border each day...we have to allow this free flow of goods and services and we have to be aware of the integration of our economies.\u201d Trudeau had a strong rapport with former Democratic President Barack Obama, prompting pundits to describe their relationship as a \u201cbromance.\u201d Soon after Trump put a hold on allowing refugees into the United States and temporarily banned travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries in an executive order on Jan. 27, citing the need to head off attacks by Islamist militants, the Canadian prime minister took to Twitter to say refugees were welcome in Canada. Analysts said Trudeau, who has strong incentives to build a relationship with Trump given rising anti-trade sentiment, is bound to be happy with the first meeting. \u201cI thought it was a huge, huge win. The worst case scenario is we wound up with an Australia moment, when a relationship that should be on solid ground takes a bad turn,\u201d said Carlo Dade, director of the Center for Trade and Investment Policy at the Canada West Foundation. \u201cInstead, we actually got an endorsement of North American jobs, of Canada-U.S. jobs, working together, no \u201cAmerica First\u201d - just the opposite,\u201d he added. Details about a tense telephone call late last month between Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had created wariness. The Washington Post, citing unidentified senior U.S. officials, said Trump abruptly ended a phone call with Turnbull, even though Australia has long been a staunch U.S. ally.  David Wilkins, former U.S. ambassador to Canada, said the priority of the meeting was to set a positive tone, and that was accomplished. \u201cThe president\u2019s comment on the economy and creating jobs together was a very positive sign for Canadians, especially those that had been concerned about the trading relationship,\u201d said Wilkins. \u201cI think it was a win-win for both countries.\u201d ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. small business community on Tuesday wrote to lawmakers urging them to step up efforts to roll back regulation introduced in the wake of the 2007-09 financial crisis that they say has stymied lending, dampening economic growth and job creation. The letter, sent to all U.S. Congressmen by more than 100 state and local chambers of commerce and seen by Reuters, highlights frustration among Main Street businesses which have yet to benefit from President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to ease access to credit by slashing financial rules. Extra bank capital and liquidity requirements introduced by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law have slowed the flow of credit and seen many services and products for small businesses eliminated, the chambers wrote, citing Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data.   \u201cWe believe Congress should develop common-sense reforms for community, mid-size and regional banks, which would help empower Main Street businesses.\u00a0We urge you to make such legislation a priority,\u201d the chambers wrote. The letter is likely to increase pressure on Democrats in the Senate to support a bipartisan bill unveiled by the Republican-led Senate Banking Committee on Monday that would offer some relief to community and regional banks by reducing the threshold at which they are considered systemically risky. That bill, which marks the first concrete congressional step toward rolling back Dodd-Frank, has nine Democratic co-sponsors, but Republicans will need to win over a handful of extra Democratic votes to be certain of its passage. Talks on the bill have dragged on for months, with Democratic lawmakers wary of appearing to offer handouts to big Wall Street banks. But they are growing more sympathetic to the idea of relaxing rules for small and regional lenders in order to make life easier for small businesses and entrepreneurs - especially with mid-term elections in 2018 looming, lobbyists said. David Hirschmann, president and CEO, Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which coordinated the letter, said there was a growing \u201ccrescendo\u201d among Democratic lawmakers on the regulatory relief issue.  \u201cA year ago with a Democrat president in the White House, you could not get nine Democrats to support even common-sense reforms like this. So what\u2019s changed? Is it because they want to help Trump? No. It\u2019s because they\u2019re hearing about this from home. That\u2019s what\u2019s causing these Democrats to come forward and to say, \u2018We need to fix this\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a real understanding that if we don\u2019t enable the banks, we are not going to have the small business lending we need. This is not a Wall Street issue; it\u2019s a Main Street issue,\u201d he added.  ",

        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday appeared skeptical toward a request from several states that want him to order the administration of Republican President Donald Trump to continue payments to health insurers under Obamacare.  At a hearing in San Francisco federal court, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria said he aimed to issue a ruling on Tuesday.  The Trump administration earlier this month terminated the payments, which help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans, as part of several moves to dismantle the signature healthcare law of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.  Trump had threatened to cut off the subsidies for months, prompting health insurers such as Anthem Inc, Humana Inc, UnitedHealth Group Inc and Aetna Inc to raise premiums or exit insurance markets. Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia sued the federal government and asked for an immediate order halting Trump\u2019s move while the case is being litigated and argued that terminating the payments harmed customers by raising insurance rates.  But Chhabria on Monday suggested that California and other states had anticipated Trump\u2019s move and worked with insurers to make sure most consumers would not be harmed. That weakens the case for a court order forcing the payments, Chhabria said.  \u201cWhy should I be ordering the administration to make these payments in the next few months while we get the case adjudicated?\u201d Chhabria asked. Since cutting off the payments, Trump has alternately supported, and dismissed, an effort by Republican and Democratic senators that would reinstate the subsidies for two years until a broader replacement to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, can be negotiated. While Democrats accused Trump of sabotaging Obamacare, the president argued that the subsidies made insurance companies \u201crich.\u201d  In a court filing on Friday, the U.S. Department of Justice pointed to a prior ruling from a Washington, D.C. federal court that said Congress had never appropriated the money for the subsidies. An appeal of that ruling is currently on hold. Either side could appeal Chhabria\u2019s ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is weighted with Democratic-appointed judges.  From there, any further appeal would go to the U.S. Supreme Court. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Highlights for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration on Friday: Trump promises a big announcement about tax reform next week and orders an administration review of Obama-era tax rules written to discourage U.S. companies from relocating overseas to cut their tax bills. Trump tells the Treasury Department to examine two powers given to regulators to police large financial companies following the 2008 financial crisis. South Korea says it is on heightened alert ahead of another important anniversary in North Korea, with a large concentration of military hardware amassed on both sides of the border amid concerns about a new nuclear test by Pyongyang. Trump, striving to make good on a top campaign promise, is pushing fellow Republicans who control Congress to pass revamped healthcare legislation but the same intraparty squabbling that torpedoed it last month could do it again. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says Syria has dispersed its warplanes in recent days and that it retains chemical weapons, an issue he says will have to be taken up diplomatically. The Department of Justice threatens to cut off funding to California as well as eight cities and counties across the United States, escalating a Trump administration crackdown on so-called \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The United States will not make an exception for American companies, including oil major Exxon Mobil Corp, seeking to drill in areas prohibited by U.S. sanctions on Russia, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says.  Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress face their first major budget test next week, with the threat of a government shutdown potentially hinging on his proposed Mexican border wall as well as Obamacare funding. The House of Representatives Intelligence Committee says it has invited FBI, National Security Agency and Obama administration officials to testify as it restarts its investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres meets with Trump at the White House for the first time since both took office earlier this year and amid a U.S. push to cut funding to the world body and its agencies. The United States has offered to help fund Mexico\u2019s efforts to eradicate opium poppies, a U.S. official says, as Mexican heroin output increased again last year. ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Utility crews from the U.S. mainland were scrambling to Puerto Rico on Thursday after Hurricane Maria left nearly the entire U.S. territory, and many of its Caribbean neighbors, without power, according to officials. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) reported almost 100 percent of its 1.5 million customers were without power as of late Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Energy said in an update on the hurricane s impact on Thursday, after Maria s winds snapped trees and utility polls.  Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello told CNN PREPA was so severely hit that it could be months before electricity is restored to all those customers. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Hurricane Maria  totally obliterated  the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico with its electrical grid destroyed. In the U.S. Virgin islands, the majority of the 25,000 customers on St. Croix were also reported to be without power, the DOE report added. Energy support crews have been deployed to St. Thomas and St. Croix in support of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) teams there, and others are prepared to deploy to Puerto Rico as soon as conditions permit, the DOE said. The American Public Power Association said it was also bringing in utility and contractor crews from parts of the U.S. mainland to help with recovery efforts.  At least one support team is already in Puerto Rico, said Mike Hyland, senior vice president, engineering services at the association, in a phone interview.  They ve been in San Juan since Maria passed and I believe they re going today to St. Thomas. ... Right now our mission is to get the lights back on,  he said, adding that there were limited flights and barges serving the islands.  The power outages have forced critical facilities, like hospitals, to rely on generators, and raised concerns about potential fuel shortages as some gas stations may not have backup power.  The fuel is there, you just can t pump it,  said Patrick DeHaan, petroleum analyst at Gasbuddy.  Maria killed at least 10 people as it raged through the Caribbean, the second major hurricane to do so this month. It packed winds of up to 155 mph (250 kph), when it made landfall on Puerto Rico on Wednesday as the strongest storm to hit the U.S. territory in nearly 90 years. Maria s devastation comes just as Puerto Rico, which is facing the largest municipal debt crisis in U.S. history, and PREPA, which is bankrupt, were recovering from Hurricane Irma, which grazed the island, knocking out power to two-thirds of the residents. Petroleum supplies just under half of the island s electricity, and natural gas supplies nearly one-third, according to federal government data.  In recent years, high world petroleum prices have driven typical Puerto Rican power prices as high as three times those in the U.S. mainland. Maria, which could strengthen somewhat over the next day or so, was forecast to move north in the Atlantic Ocean over the weekend, the NHC said. ",

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional committee members warned on Friday that Washington\u2019s funding of the World Health Organization\u2019s cancer research agency could be halted unless it is more open about its operations. In a letter to the France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) - a semi-autonomous unit of the WHO - the U.S. House of Representatives Science, Space, and Technology (SST) Committee warned it \u201cmay reconsider U.S. taxpayer funding\u201d if IARC \u201cdoes not demonstrate transparency\u201d. No-one at IARC, which is based in Lyon, France, was immediately available to comment. Since 1985, IARC has received more than $48 million from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, $22 million of which has gone to IARC\u2019s \u201cmonograph\u201d program, which assesses whether various substances can cause cancer in people. Friday\u2019s letter is the latest twist in an ongoing feud between IARC and two congressional committees. They began an investigation in 2016 after a number of IARC\u2019s assessments - that substances as diverse as coffee, mobile phones and processed meat cause cancer - sparked controversy. The lawmakers said their concerns were also fueled by the cancer agency\u2019s review of glyphosate, the primary ingredient of Monsanto\u2019s weedkiller Roundup.     A Reuters investigation in October found that a draft of a key section of IARC\u2019s assessment of glyphosate underwent significant changes before the report was made public. In their letter, SST Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, Vice Chairman Frank Lucas, and Chairman of the Environment Subcommittee, Andy Biggs, repeated an earlier request to IARC\u2019s director, Christopher Wild, to provide potential witnesses for a hearing before their committee.  \u201cIf IARC does not provide a full response to the request for potential witnesses, the committee will consider whether the values of scientific integrity and transparency are reflected in IARC Monographs and if future expenditures of federal taxpayer dollars to this end need to continue,\u201d they wrote. Smith and Biggs had last month written to Wild asking him for more information about IARC\u2019s operations and a list of potential witnesses for a hearing.  Wild responded in a letter on Nov. 20 in which he defended IARC\u2019s monographs as \u201cconsensus evaluations developed by working groups of independent experts, free from vested interests\u201d.  He declined to provide a list of potential witnesses for the hearing, but said Smith and Biggs would be welcome to visit IARC and question him and his staff. In Friday\u2019s letter, the lawmakers said their concerns about IARC were of a \u201cserious nature\u201d and \u201cshould not be disregarded by IARC\u201d. They asked Wild to respond by Dec. 15. ",

        "title": "House Freedom Caucus chief calls for U.S. tax reform plan by end-July",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the House Freedom Caucus called on congressional leaders Friday to introduce a formal tax reform proposal by the end of July, and suggested they could support a 2018 budget deal in exchange for adding welfare reform to any tax overhaul. The conservative bloc, which has enough members to stymie legislation in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, will play a key role in efforts to agree on a 2018 fiscal plan that could determine whether President Donald Trump and Congress can deliver the biggest tax reform since the Reagan era. The caucus has already called on Republican leaders to secure a tax reform deal by keeping Congress in session through August, when lawmakers are due to take a lengthy summer break.   \u201cWe need to get tax reform done sooner than later, and by that we should have a real proposal that we start debating before we leave at the end of July,\u201d Representative Chairman Mark Meadows, chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told a Heritage Foundation forum. Meadows recommended that Republican leaders acknowledge that there is no consensus on the controversial border adjustment tax proposal favored by House Speaker Paul Ryan to move the tax debate forward.  A border adjustment tax on imports has been promoted as a way both to attack the U.S. trade deficit and generate revenues that would help avoid paying for tax cuts by expanding the national deficit. Trump, however, did not include a border adjustment tax in his proposed budget. Representative Jim Jordan, Freedom Caucus co-founder, said tax reform could have trouble moving forward because House Republicans are having trouble agreeing on a budget with reconciliation instructions needed to allow Republicans to bypass Democrats in passing a tax overhaul. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get a budget agreement, you can\u2019t get reconciliation. If you don\u2019t have reconciliation, you can\u2019t get tax reform,\u201d Jordan told the forum. He suggested that Freedom Caucus members could agree to higher budget spending levels if reconciliation instructions included welfare reforms intended to save $400 billion in spending over a decade.  \u201cWe think that is the key to unlocking this road block that we\u2019re in. I don\u2019t see any other way out of it to get a budget agreement,\u201d Jordan said. Meanwhile, Meadows voiced support for allowing U.S. corporations to repatriate an estimated $2.6 trillion in cash held overseas at a reduced 8 percent tax rate. Meadows said the caucus does not plan to support a proposal that would allow full expensing for corporations, a policy backed by House Republican leaders. The policy, which would allow companies to write off capital investments immediately, would be too expensive without the border adjustment tax and revenue-raising proposals that caucus members oppose.

        "title": "British spy chief says Islamist militants can execute deadly attack plans in just days",
        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain faces the most acute threat ever from Islamist militants seeking to inflict mass attacks, often with spontaneous plots that take just days to bring to execution, the head of the MI5 domestic intelligence agency said on Tuesday. After four militant attacks this year that killed 36 people in Britain - the deadliest spate since the London  7/7  bombings of July 2005, MI5 chief Andrew Parker said the threat was at the highest tempo he had seen in 34 years of espionage.  The threat is more diverse than I have ever known: plots developed here in the UK, but plots directed from overseas as well, plots online, complex scheming and also crude stabbings, lengthy planning but also spontaneous attacks,  said Parker.  Attacks can sometimes accelerate from inception, through planning, to action in just a handful of days,  he said in a speech in central London. The director general of MI5 rarely gives public speeches. The last was in 2015.  Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq have been in retreat for two years: They lost their de facto capital in Syria, Raqqa, on Tuesday and have been forced back into an ever-diminishing foothold along the Euphrates river valley. But as their territory, wealth and swagger decline, the militants have intensified online propaganda which has helped radicalize and inspire extremists to attack civilians in the name of Islam across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Parker said there had not yet been a large influx of British militants returning home from Syria and Iraq. Britain has foiled 20 plots in the past four years, with seven Islamist attacks prevented in the past seven months, Parker said. He said there were 500 live operations involving 3,000 people involved in militant activity. MI5, established in 1909 to counter German espionage ahead of World War One, is tasked with protecting British national security and so takes the lead, along with the police, in countering militant attacks. But after a suicide bomber killed 22 people at a pop concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande in Manchester, MI5 began a review of how it handled intelligence on the bomber, Salman Abedi, who was known to the intelligence agencies. Abedi was not among the 3,000 people currently under active investigation by MI5, although he was one of around 20,000 people known to have some connection to extremism.  When an attack happens, we are determined, using the harsh light of hindsight, to squeeze out every last drop of learning,  Parker said.  We are constantly evolving to stay ahead.  MI5, which employs around 4,000 people, says it does not have the resources to monitor every suspicious person. It works alongside the Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, which operates abroad, and GCHQ, Britain s eavesdropping agency.  Britain has repeatedly demanded that Silicon Valley companies do more to suppress extremist content and allow access to online communication.  After British militants rammed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and went on the rampage through packed bars, stabbing revelers in June, Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain must be tougher on stamping out Islamist militancy and proposed regulating cyberspace. Parker said militants  abuse of the internet could slow down the rapid pace of the hunt for attackers.  This pace together with the way in which extremists can exploit safe spaces online can make threats harder to detect and give us a smaller window to intervene.  Britain s interior minister, Amber Rudd, said earlier this month that WhatsApp s end-to-end encryption communication services allowed pedophiles and organized crime groups to operate beyond the reach of the law. But Parker refrained from naming any companies directly and called for a nuanced partnership to tackle militants and serious crimes such as child abuse.  I am not somehow King Canute trying to hold back the tide of developing technology and wouldn t wish to be heard that way,  he said.  Technology is not the enemy, indeed it holds many opportunities for us.  When asked directly whether Google, Facebook and Amazon were doing enough to prevent communications among militants, he said:  There is a reasonable expectation, I think, from all of us but also from the public at large that these companies would do what they can to help us deal with these worst excesses.

        "title": "Obama touts Supreme Court choice as symbol of fair-mindedness",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As valedictorian of his high school class, Merrick Garland let his audience know precisely how he felt when parents unplugged the sound system that day in protest at a classmate\u2019s speech against the Vietnam War. He may not necessarily have agreed with the topic or tone but, stirred by the sight of a student\u2019s voice being silenced, Garland abandoned his prepared remarks to deliver instead an impassioned defense of free speech. U.S. President Barack Obama told that story on Wednesday when he nominated Garland, now a 63-year-old judge, on what is often called the second highest court in the land, to a seat on the Supreme Court, the country\u2019s highest court. Obama praised what he called Garland\u2019s \u201ctrack record of building consensus as a thoughtful, fair-minded judge who follows the law.\u201d Although Garland faces an uphill fight from a Republican-led U.S Senate opposed to anyone the Democratic president nominates, the judge is praised by politicians left and right, even after 19 years on the federal bench. The showdown promises to figure in the campaign for the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election with Republicans demanding that Obama leave the seat vacant and let his successor, to be sworn in next January, make the selection. Garland, picked to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13, has been a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1997. His appointment to that court, by Democratic President Bill Clinton, was confirmed by the Senate, 76-23. The bipartisan support is one reason Obama might have for nominating him. In 2010, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, described Garland as a \u201cconsensus nominee\u201d who would \u201cget a lot of votes.\u201d The court has served as a launching pad to the nine-member Supreme Court for several justices including Scalia. Chief judge since 2013, Garland is viewed as a moderate whose legal approach was shaped by a lengthy career as a federal prosecutor. As a senior Justice Department official, Garland oversaw the prosecution in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing case in which 168 people, many of them children, were killed. He secured the death penalty for the lead defendant, anti-government militant Timothy McVeigh.  Jamie Gorelick, the No. 2 Justice Department official at the time, said in an interview that Garland immediately asked to go to Oklahoma to oversee the case. \u201cWhen the bomb went off in Oklahoma and we started to see the children being pulled out of the wreckage, Merrick, who had young children at the time, was so moved by this and so angered by it he asked if we could send him out to Oklahoma to help,\u201d she said. His background as a prosecutor has shaped his views as a judge, lawyers who practice before the appeals court said. Garland is viewed as less defendant-friendly than other Democratic appointees. But Garland is not afraid to rule against the federal government. In a 2013 case, he was part of a three-judge panel that ruled against the Central Intelligence Agency in its bid to keep documents secret concerning the use of armed drones. In 2008, he wrote on behalf of a three-judge panel when the court ruled in favor of a detainee held at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Garland wrote that a U.S. tribunal was wrong to find that detainee Huzaifa Parhat, an ethnic Uighur from China, was an \u201cenemy combatant.\u201d Garland grew up in Chicago. His mother was a community volunteer and his father ran a small business. Obama said at the White House that Garland had to sell his comic book collection to help fund his college education. Garland would become the fourth Jewish member of the nine-member court. The other five are Roman Catholics. His education also mirrors those of the other justices. If confirmed, all of the justices would have studied at either Yale or Harvard law school. Garland attended Harvard. ",

        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian petrochemical holding Sibur said on Monday it had no direct dealings with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and that its ties to its partners were not in breach of sanctions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis. Sibur was commenting on reports that Ross has kept investments in Navigator Holdings, a shipping firm which has supplied services to Sibur. Stakeholders in Sibur include an associate of Russian Vladimir Putin who is subject to U.S. sanctions. In a statement, Sibur said that in the first half of this year, Sibur spent $15.9 million on services provided by Navigator, or 2.8 percent of Sibur\u2019s overall expenditure on logistics. It said Navigator was never a sole contractor for shipping Sibur\u2019s petrochemical products. \u201cAll negotiations and meetings were held solely by Sibur management and solely with management of those companies (which were shipping Sibur\u2019s liquefied petroleum gas) and without shareholders\u2019 involvement,\u201d Sibur said in an emailed statement. \u201cIn connection with the introduction in 2014 of sanctions with regard to one of the company\u2019s shareholders, our counter-parties conducted all necessary checks into whether there were any restrictions on working with Sibur. No such restrictions were found,\u201d the statement said. \u201cSibur expresses its surprise at the politically-charged interpretation in certain media publications of regular commercial activities, over many years, which from the outset were reflected in the company\u2019s published accounts.\u201d Sibur\u2019s shareholders include Gennady Timchenko, a close Putin ally who has been under U.S. sanctions since 2014. Another Sibur shareholder is Putin\u2019s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov. Shamalov did not reply to an email from Reuters seeking  comment. Spokesman for Volga Group, an investment vehicle for Timchenko\u2019s assets, declined to comment.  The New York Times and other publications, citing leaked documents from an offshore law firm, reported that partnerships used by Ross have a 31 percent stake in Navigator Holdings. Reuters has not independently verified the documents. ",

        "text": "GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Eighteen people, including a provincial lawmaker, went on trial in eastern Congo on Thursday for the rapes of dozens of children, victims  rights activists said. At least 46 children, some as young as 18 months, were raped near the village of Kavumu between 2013 and 2016, sparking an international outcry and criticism of Democratic Republic of Congo s government for its slow response. In June last year, authorities arrested Frederic Batumike, a deputy from South Kivu province, and members of a militia he is alleged to have led. Rights groups hope the trial, which is expected to last several weeks, will strike a blow against impunity in Congo, where they say government forces and militia groups in the lawless eastern borderland have long used rape as a weapon of war. The trial opened in a military court in Kavumu on Thursday with the defendants facing charges of rape, murder and organization of an armed group, Jean Chrysostome Kijana, an activist representing the victims, told Reuters.  Proceedings began 10 hours late and lasted just 20 minutes, during which the defendants  names were read aloud.   The start of the trial is a strong signal in the fight against impunity,  said Kijana. However, he added that the delay to proceedings did raise fears that the trial could end up just being  yet another in a long list of botched trials . Millions died in eastern Congo in regional wars between 1996 and 2003, most from hunger and disease. Dozens of armed groups continue to prey on local populations and exploit the area s rich natural resources. Experts say Congo has made some progress in combating sexual violence and several high-level militia and army commanders have been successfully prosecuted in recent years, but the problem remains pervasive. According to the government, Batumike s militia employed a spiritual adviser who told its fighters that raping very young children would confer supernatural protection. Advocacy groups involved in the case say it has been particularly difficult to investigate because the victims are so young and their families were often asleep when the alleged rapes occurred. ",

        "text": "ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iran deployed a dozen tanks supported by artillery at its border with Iraq s autonomous Kurdish region on Monday, a Kurdish official said, adding that the move was a dangerous escalation in the crisis triggered by Iraqi Kurdistan s independence vote.  The tanks can be seen from the Kurdish side,  an official from the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) security council told Reuters, adding that the move was a  dangerous escalation.   Iraq s Kurds overwhelmingly voted for independence in a referendum held one week ago, defying the central government in Baghdad as well as neighboring Turkey and Iran, which fear Kurdish separatism within their own borders. The deployment at the Parviz Khan border point on Monday was part of joint military drills conducted by the Iranian and the Iraqi armed forces in response to the referendum, state media in Tehran said. The exercises began last Sunday, according to Iran s Mehr news agency.  The KRG says it plans to use the referendum s result as a mandate to negotiate the peaceful secession of the Kurdish region through talks with Baghdad. KRG President Masoud Barzani said on Monday it was legitimate to hold the vote in the Kurdish areas, including in the multi-ethnic oil city of Kirkuk, also claimed by Baghdad.  Kirkuk is a Kurdistani city which should become an example for the coexistence of nations and religions,  he said during a visit to Kirkuk. But Baghdad has rejected any talks with the KRG over independence. It demanded that the KRG relinquish control over its external border crossings with Turkey, Iran and Syria. It also demanded the KRG hand over its airports to federal control. When the KRG turned down those demands, Iraq s central government imposed a ban on international flights to and from the region s two international airports on Friday. The interior ministry said on Monday foreigners stranded in the Kurdish region by the ban would be allowed to exit through Baghdad s airport without having to wait for an Iraqi visa. Many nationalities, especially westerners, were allowed into the KRG without a visa.   Baghdad gained the support of Cairo s al-Azhar, the highest seat of Sunni Muslim learning, on Monday. It issued a statement  rejecting invitations to divide Iraq.  Al-Azhar s position could help Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, a Shi ite, rally some support among Iraq s large Sunni minority against the Kurds, who are also largely Sunni.      In another effort to present the government as inclusive for all Iraqis, including Kurds, state TV announced on Monday that it will be broadcasting a daily news bulletin in Kurdish.    Iraq s defense ministry said on Friday the Iraqi authorities planned to take control of the borders of its autonomous Kurdistan region  in coordination  with Iran and Turkey. The statement did not give details. Nor did it indicate whether Iraqi forces would move toward the border posts controlled by the KRG from the Iranian and Turkish side, or set up checkpoints in the vicinity of these posts in order to control the crossings. Iranian state television on Saturday quoted a military spokesman as saying Iran and Iraq  agreed on measures to establish border security and receive Iraqi forces that are to be stationed at border posts .  We have always respected our borders with our neighbors and any (military) move will be in coordination with Baghdad  and our allies,  a senior Iranian official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Iran has vowed to stand alongside Baghdad in the fallout following the referendum. Allowing Iraq to seize border posts from Kurdish control would further cement Iran s stance to renounce dealings with the Kurdistan region in favor of the central government in Baghdad. Backed by Ankara and Tehran, the Iraqi government has demanded that the Kurdish leadership cancel the result of the referendum or face the prospect of sanctions, international isolation and possibly a military intervention. A small Iraqi force is also deployed on the Turkish side of the border as part of joint drills with the Turkish army. Iran s military chief, General Mohammad Baqeri, met Turkish Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar in Tehran on Monday.  Iran and Turkey share the same stance on the referendum in Iraqi Kurdistan and both insist on the sovereignty of Iraq,  Baqeri was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA after his meeting with Akar.      The armed forces of both countries will increase cooperation in training and war games,  he was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. ",

        "text": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - At least five people were killed on Friday as Kenyan police tried to disperse supporters accompanying opposition leader Raila Odinga from the airport to central Nairobi, police said.     Police fired tear gas at the convoy in which Odinga was traveling and used water cannon as they tried to stop it reaching the capital s main business district. Some protesters threw stones at police. Two vehicles, including a police truck, were set on fire. A Reuters photographer saw two bodies with gunshot wounds as police and protesters fought on one of the main roads leading to the business district. Police said five people were stoned to death by angry mobs after they were caught stealing and denied they had used excessive force against the opposition supporters.  These incidences occurred before the police arrived at the various scenes,  the police service said in a statement. Police retreated several times along the route after the protesters were unmoved by the teargas and water cannon spray. They finally held their ground near the city s main park, where Odinga, just returned from the United States, intended to address a rally that had been banned. He blamed President Uhuru Kenyatta for the violence.  My anger is with that guy called Uhuru Kenyatta. I went abroad... After you welcomed me well, he sent policemen to teargas you, to beat my people, to fire bullets at them. Isn t this barbaric?,  he told his supporters after driving to safety. Odinga has called for a  National Resistance Movement  to protest against the outcome of a repeat presidential election last month which saw Kenyatta win a second, five-year term with 98 percent of the vote after Odinga boycotted the contest. Only 39 percent of registered voters took part. The repeat poll was ordered by the Supreme Court after it annulled the results of the August election, won by Kenyatta, over procedural irregularities. The court will rule on Monday on cases that seek to nullify the rerun election.  The political crisis has stirred fears for the stability of Kenya, a regional hub for trade, diplomacy and security.  Earlier on Friday, demonstrators threw up burning barricades on Mombasa Road, the highway that links Nairobi s downtown business district and the airport. Despite a partial police ban on protests in the capital, hundreds of people had gathered in the morning near Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to await Odinga s return. Police fired into the air to disperse them. Once Odinga landed, motorcycle taxi drivers and people on foot shouted their support as the motorcade, which included lawmakers from Odinga s opposition coalition, began moving toward central Nairobi. Dozens of international flights depart and arrive daily at Nairobi s main airport. The national airport authority said on Twitter just before midday that operations were running normally.  Kenya Airways said it had been  impacted  by the disruptions around the airport and offered to book travelers who missed their flights on subsequent ones.   Kenya s prolonged election season has disrupted its economy. Human rights groups say at least 66 people have died in bloodshed surrounding the two elections. Ahead of Monday s Supreme Court ruling, Kenya Airways  chairman told an investor briefing on Friday:  Hopefully we don t have another presidential election so we can get on with life.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday backed new sanctions on Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia, part of an effort to take a tough line against Tehran without immediately moving to undermine an international nuclear agreement. Three Hezbollah-related measures passed by voice vote, without opposition. The House will vote on Thursday on another bill, to impose additional sanctions on Iran related to its ballistic missiles program. President Donald Trump said on Oct. 13 he would not certify Iran is complying with an international agreement on its nuclear program, and threatened that he might ultimately terminate the accord. Trump\u2019s action opened a 60-day window for Congress to act to reimpose sanctions on Iran\u2019s nuclear program that were lifted under the agreement, but there has been no move to do so in the House or Senate. Aides said that, for now, House lawmakers are focusing on clamping down on Iran in other ways such as the Hezbollah and missile-related sanctions. The first of the Hezbollah-related measures passed on Wednesday would impose new sanctions on any entities found to support the group, such as by providing weapons to Hezbollah. The second imposes sanctions on Iran and Hezbollah for using civilians as human shields. The third was a resolution urging the European Union to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. The United State named Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. Earlier this month, Washington offered multimillion-dollar rewards for two of its officials as the Trump administration developed its strategy for countering Iran\u2019s growing regional influence. \u201cThese critical measures will impose new sanctions to crack down on Hezbollah\u2019s financing, and hold it accountable for its acts of death and destruction,\u201d said Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. However, winning international support for an intensified campaign against Hezbollah could prove difficult. The powerful organization is part of Lebanon\u2019s fragile coalition government and commands enormous support for the social services it provides. ",

        "title": "Under China anthem cloud, rare interest in Hong Kong vs Bahrain soccer friendly",
        "text": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Some activists in Hong Kong say they plan to defy a Chinese law against disrespecting the national anthem, by jeering it at international soccer fixtures against Bahrain and Lebanon in the next few days. The controversy is another instance of recent tensions in the former British colony between pro-democracy advocates and China s Communist Party leaders, who have been criticized for tightening their grip on Hong Kong s affairs. Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a  one country, two systems  arrangement that guarantees a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary and the freedom of expression. In recent years, some Hong Kong fans have booed the national anthem at soccer matches, with some parallels to protests in the United States where American football players have knelt during the national anthem, a protest denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump. China s parliament on Saturday passed an amendment to its criminal law that extends punishments for publicly desecrating the national flag and emblem to disrespecting the national anthem.  Offenders can be jailed for up to three years, Xinhua reported. Hong Kong, as part of China, is now obliged to put its own set of laws related to the national anthem to the local legislature, but details including jail terms and the scope of enforcement have yet to be set. For now, though, some fans say they won t change their behavior when Hong Kong play Bahrain in a friendly match on Thursday and Lebanon in an Asian Cup qualifier next Tuesday.  It s something we ve always done,  said one fan who has attended games for the past few years, including two World Cup qualifiers between Hong Kong and China in 2015 that drew jeers from the crowd.  It s a kind of resentment toward China that comes through ... There are several hundred of us and it s become a tradition now. We ll keep doing it.  The Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA) was warned by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) recently over the conduct of fans who booed the Chinese anthem, and said  a repeat violation may result in more severe punishment . Asked for comment, the AFC didn t specifically address a question on whether they d been pressed by China to punish Hong Kong, but said a review of video evidence found fans guilty of  improper conduct  under the AFC s disciplinary and ethics code. Hong Kong s leader, Carrie Lam, has suggested the law would be enacted in the current legislative year, and not be applied retrospectively - which would mean fans who jeer before it becomes law locally shouldn t face prosecution.  People should not excessively worry about unwittingly committing an offense. These worries are unnecessary,  Lam told reporters.  I don t see this as having any connection to ... freedom of expression. But this has highlighted a recent trend in Hong Kong that whenever there is anything related to Hong Kong and Chinese affairs ... some people cause panic and unnecessary fear.  ",

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump once again criticized London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Monday over his response to a deadly attack on the city, while the British public and politicians lauded the mayor for his handling of the aftermath.  Trump accused Khan of making a \u201cpathetic excuse\u201d over his statement urging Londoners not to be alarmed by the presence of additional police on the streets in response to the attack. But British Prime Minister Theresa May said Khan was doing a \u201cgood job\u201d, echoing public sentiment across London. Three jihadis drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge  on Saturday night before running into the bustling Borough Market area where they slit people\u2019s throats and stabbed them indiscriminately. Police shot dead all three attackers. Khan had said on Sunday morning that people would see an increased police presence on the streets of the capital and should not be alarmed by that. Trump mocked Khan\u2019s comment on Sunday, suggesting in a tweet that the mayor was downplaying the attacks. A spokesman for Khan responded that the mayor \u201chas more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump\u2019s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context\u201d his remarks. Trump\u2019s comments drew widespread scorn in Britain but the U.S. leader went on the attack again on Monday, saying in a tweet: \u201cPathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his \u2018no reason to be alarmed\u2019 statement. MSM is working hard to sell it!\u201d Trump wrote. MSM referred to mainstream media. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she did not think it was fair to characterize Trump\u2019s tweets as \u201cpicking a fight\u201d with Khan, who is the first Muslim elected as London mayor. \u201cThe point is, there is a reason to be alarmed. We have constant attacks going on, not just there but across the globe, and we have to start putting national security and global security at an all time high,\u201d she told a White House briefing. Khan said he had been too busy dealing with the fallout from the attack to respond directly to the tweet. Khan, who belongs to the opposition Labour Party, is popular in London and his response to Saturday\u2019s killings has been widely praised as dignified. Prime Minister May, the Conservative Party leader, was asked earlier on Monday about Trump\u2019s criticism of Khan. \u201cI think Sadiq Khan is doing a good job and it is wrong to say anything else,\u201d she said. Khan\u2019s statement on Sunday morning condemned the attack and gave a number of details about what had happened and what measures were being taken in response. \u201cLondoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. No reason to be alarmed. One of the things the police, all of us need to do is make sure we\u2019re as safe as we possibly can be,\u201d Khan said. In his Sunday tweet, Trump commented: \u201cAt least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \u2018no reason to be alarmed!\u2019\u201d It was met with a barrage of criticism in both Britain and the United States, with former Vice President Al Gore among many public figures who accused Trump of misrepresenting what Khan had said. A YouGov poll of 1,000 Londoners published on Monday found that Khan was more trusted than both May and national Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to make the right decisions about keeping Britain safe from terrorism. \u201cMy focus from Saturday night has been working with the police the emergency services and the government to deal with the horrific attack on Saturday,\u201d Khan told Sky News, when asked about Trump\u2019s latest tweet. \u201cI just haven\u2019t got time to respond to tweets from Donald Trump. I\u2019ve got better and more important things to focus on.\u201d     The two men have history. During the U.S. presidential election campaign, Khan was among many people who spoke out against Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States, an idea he said would play into the hands of extremists. During a visit to Chicago in September last year, Khan endorsed Trump\u2019s opponent Hillary Clinton. In March, after an attack by an Islamic militant that left five people dead in Westminster, central London, Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. issued a tweet that criticized Khan. Trump Jr. wrote \u201cYou have got to be kidding me?!\u201d above a link to an article reporting comments Khan had made months earlier.  In the article, Khan was reported as saying that being prepared for terror attacks was \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of living in a major city.  ",

        "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Europe s top human rights organization asked Italy for more information on its work intercepting migrants at sea, warning that any moves to return them to Libya would break international treaties. The Council of Europe said on Wednesday it had written to the Italian government a day after an Italian navy ship helped Libya s coastguard as it headed off 228 migrants. The coastguard later brought the refugees back to Libya. Italy would break the European Convention on Human Rights if it had a direct role in returning migrants to Libya, where they face  a real risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,  the Council s human rights commissioner, Nils Muiznieks wrote. Italy s interior minister, Marco Minniti, told Ansa news agency the country s ships had never returned migrants to Libya after a rescue.  Italy s activities are aimed at training, equipping and giving logistical support to the Libyan coast guard, not in returns,  he added. Andrea Doria destroyer provided a Libyan coast guard vessel with life-jackets as it took migrants off of two rubber boats on Sept. 27, according to Italy s navy.  The coastguard later posted pictures online of it bringing the migrants back to Libya, and said they were taken to detention centers. The United Nations has condemned Libyan detention centers as  inhuman  because of abuse and a lack of basic hygiene, medical care and even food. The Council of Europe said on Wednesday Muiznieks wrote to Minniti on Sept. 28. Italy and the European Union have provided training, equipment, repairs and vessels to the Libyan coastguard in an effort to bolster its ability to stop to the departure of overcrowded migrant boats. More than 600,000 migrants have set out for Europe from Libya since 2014. With Italy facing an election early next year, Minniti has spearheaded efforts to try to provide money and equipment to Libyan authorities that agree to fight people smuggling. Sea arrivals to Italy have fallen 25 percent this year over the same period of 2016 as the Libyan coast guard working in tandem with an armed group west of Tripoli clamped down on departures. Departures from east of Tripoli and from Tunisia, however, are now on the increase. ",

She is not expected to have an official title and will not be paid a salary. Ivanka Trump will be joining her husband, Jared Kushner, who is a chief adviser to the president and is a regular presence at his father-in-law\u2019s side. When Kushner\u2019s job was announced earlier this year, aides said Ivanka would not take on a role in her father\u2019s White House but would focus on settling her family in Washington.  Since then, she has been a frequent behind-the-scenes adviser. Last Friday, she sat next to visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel when Merkel visited the White House. ",

        "title": "As 'Bridgegate' trial begins, New Jersey's Christie remains focus",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is not expected to attend the trial this week of two former associates charged in the 2013 \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal, but the failed Republican presidential hopeful\u2019s shadow will loom over the proceedings. Opening statements are scheduled for Monday in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly are charged with conspiracy and fraud in a nine-count indictment alleging they arranged lane closings that caused gridlock on the heavily traveled George Washington Bridge. The resulting traffic delayed commuters for hours and left emergency vehicles slow in responding to 911 calls. Prosecutors said the two defendants planned the lane closures to take revenge on a mayor who refused to endorse Christie for re-election. The governor, at one time a leading Republican presidential hopeful, has not been charged in the scandal that nevertheless helped torpedo his hopes for nomination to the White House in 2016. In the three years since the scandal broke, Christie has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the plan to disrupt traffic on the world\u2019s busiest road bridge, despite speculation to the contrary. The trial could finally provide a definitive answer to the question of whether he knew about the alleged plot, and if so, when. \u201cBridgegate\u201d took place after Democratic Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich declined to endorse the governor\u2019s reelection campaign in 2013. Christie was seeking support from local mayors to demonstrate bipartisan backing for a Republican governor in a Democratic-leaning state, part of an effort to position himself for a 2016 White House bid. Prosecutors say the lane closures were ordered in September 2013 by Kelly, Christie\u2019s then deputy chief of staff; Baroni, then deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; and David Wildstein, another Christie ally at the Port Authority who has since pleaded guilty.  The GW carries more than 250,000 vehicles a day across the Hudson River between New Jersey and Manhattan. The trio concocted a cover story, saying the closure was part of a traffic study, prosecutors contend. The shutdown lasted four days, while Baroni and Wildstein ignored increasingly frantic messages from the mayor, according to prosecutors. The ruse fell apart under scrutiny from journalists and the Democratic-controlled state legislature. In January 2014, emails and text messages were publicly disclosed that showed the officials\u2019 involvement, including an Aug. 13, 2013, email in which Kelly told Wildstein: \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\u201d Wildstein, who is expected to be a star government witness, has previously said there is evidence that Christie was aware of the lane closures when they occurred. Jurors also may hear from Kelly and Baroni, as lawyers for both defendants have said they plan to testify in their own defense. The defense has suggested it will point the finger at others, including Christie, in arguing that Kelly and Baroni would never have acted on their own. In a pretrial motion, a lawyer for Baroni revealed that a former Christie aide said in a text message that the governor \u201cflat-out lied\u201d when he said during a 2013 press conference that none of his senior staff were involved in the scandal.  A spokesman for the governor has said the text message does not disprove Christie\u2019s contention that he was unaware of the plot. Since abandoning his own candidacy for president, Christie has become one of Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s most visible supporters. ",

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s upper parliamentary chamber, the House of Lords, has appointed a woman to the role of  Black Rod  for the first time in the office s 650-year history. Sarah Clarke, currently responsible for the organization of the annual Wimbledon tennis championships, will be known as The Lady Usher of the Black Rod. In charge of the major ceremonial events in the Palace of Westminster, Black Rod is best known for having the door to the House of Commons slammed in the official s face at the State Opening of Parliament to symbolize the independence of the lower House. Black Rod traditionally reacts to the historic insult by banging three times on the door with his symbol of office, an ebony staff topped with a golden lion. The door is then opened and all Members of Parliament follow Black Rod back to the Lords Chamber to hear the Queen s Speech. The earliest known reference to the role is in letters patent from 1361 which refer to one Walter Whitehorse performing the role. There are thought to have been 60 holders of the position since then, while there are also Black Rods in the parliaments and legislative assemblies of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  In a statement, Clarke, who will start early next year,  said she was honored to be invited to take up the role.   The House of Lords is a place where the smallest detail is as important as the big picture and the depth of heritage and tradition is second to none,  she said. Lord Fowler, Speaker of the House of Lords said it was a historic moment for the House.  People are most familiar with Black Rod for the part they play at State Opening, but the job is much more than that,  he said. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several environmental groups filed lawsuits against the Trump administration on Thursday to challenge its decision to approve construction of TransCanada Corp\u2019s controversial Keystone XL crude oil pipeline. In two separate filings to a federal court in Montana, environmental groups argued that the U.S. State Department, which granted the permit needed for the pipeline to cross the Canadian border, relied on an \u201coutdated and incomplete environmental impact statement\u201d when making its decision earlier this month. By approving the pipeline without public input and an up-to-date environmental assessment, the administration violated the National Environmental Policy Act, groups including the Center for Biological Diversity, Sierra Club and the Northern Plains Resource Council said in their legal filing. \u201cThey have relied on an arbitrary, stale, and incomplete environmental review completed over three years ago, for a process that ended with the State Department\u2019s denial of a cross-border permit,\u201d the court filing says. In the other filing, the Indigenous Environmental Network and North Coast Rivers Alliance sought injunctive relief, restraining Transcanada from taking any action that would harm the \u201cphysical environment in connection with the project pending a full hearing on the merits.\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump announced the presidential permit for the Keystone XL at the White House last week. TransCanada\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Russ Girling and Sean McGarvey, president of North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions, stood nearby. Trump, a Republican, said the project would lower consumer fuel prices, create jobs and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.  His Democratic predecessor, former president Barack Obama, rejected the pipeline, saying it would lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and do nothing to reduce fuel prices for U.S. motorists. \u201cThis tar sands pipeline poses a direct threat to our climate, our clean water, wildlife, and thousands of landowners and communities along the route of this dirty and dangerous project, and it must and will be stopped,\u201d said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit. The lawsuits came on the heels of a lawsuit filed on Wednesday challenging other recent moves to undo Obama\u2019s climate change regulations. Conservation groups and the Northern Cheyenne Native American tribe of Montana sued the administration on Wednesday for violating the National Environmental Policy Act when it lifted a moratorium on coal leases on federal land.  All lawsuits have been filed in U.S. District Court in Montana\u2019s Great Falls Division. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will send its healthcare overhaul plan passed this month to the Senate after it receives a final analysis by congressional reviewers, probably in a couple of weeks, House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Friday.  Ryan said in a radio interview that the delay was \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d until the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) releases its findings on the legislation\u2019s costs and its impact on health insurance coverage.     The CBO\u2019s analysis, or \u201cscore,\u201d is expected late Wednesday,  taking into account final changes to the bill before it passed the Republican-led House earlier this month.  \u201cWe are just basically being overly cautious, but there\u2019s really kind of a non-issue here,\u201d Ryan told the syndicated Hugh Hewitt radio show. \u201cWe\u2019re moving it over to the Senate probably in a couple of weeks.\u201d Republicans are eager to make good on their campaign promise to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law, also known as Obamacare.  Their plan narrowly passed the House on May 4 despite clashes within the Republican Party between hard-line and more moderate members. Ryan dismissed the likelihood that the new CBO score could force another vote in the House. The measure still faces a potentially steep climb in the Senate, where Republicans hold a narrower majority. Senate Republican leaders have formed a Republican working group, but it is unclear how much of the House bill they will accept. Some senators in both parties have vowed to start from scratch.  \u201cWhat we\u2019ve had so far is a debacle on healthcare,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate finance committee, said Friday in an interview with Reuters. \u201cYou can\u2019t make this stuff up.\u201d Wyden said he was wary of a Senate bipartisan group that is also working on healthcare. Republican Senators Susan Collins and Bill Cassidy, who have proposed letting states decide whether to keep, scrap or replace Obamacare, have attracted several Democrats to bipartisan talks in search of common ground. Wyden said he feared the Cassidy-Collins approach would let states allow insurance companies to sell \u201cjunk plans\u201d that do not include health benefits like hospitalization. \u201cPut me down for freedom to innovate and flexibility, but on that issue, that doesn\u2019t mean the freedom to leave people without decent care,\u201d Wyden told Reuters. Lawmakers in both chambers must also grapple with potential voter backlash ahead of the 2018 congressional election.  Public opinion polls have shown slipping support for Republican efforts. A Politico/Morning Consult poll this month found 44 percent of nearly 2,000 people surveyed disapproved of the House bill compared with 38 percent who approved of it. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s spokesman, Drew Hammill, said the House bill was becoming a liability for Republicans and \u201chas no chance of success in the Senate, and now may even have to come back to the House to be amended.\u201d   Before the latest changes, the CBO had said the bill would leave 24 million more Americans uninsured by 2026 and slice about $150 billion off the budget deficit.  The House bill allows states to decide whether insurers can charge more to people with pre-existing conditions and roll back Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. ",

        "title": "Risks ahead for U.S. tax push as disputes linger, Trump returns",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Republicans pushed ahead on Monday on a U.S. tax code overhaul as a Senate panel considered the issue, but risks lay ahead with major intraparty disputes unsettled and President Donald Trump returning soon from Asia as the debate heats up. While overseas at a leaders conference, Trump tweeted some tax bill suggestions early on Monday that were starkly different from the two Republican plans being considered in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. He called on lawmakers to add a highly risky provision to their tax effort: repealing the individual mandate included in the 2010 Obamacare health insurance law that requires Americans to have health coverage or pay a tax to Washington. Neither of the two Republican plans includes such a politically divisive measure. Efforts by Republicans to dismantle Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, collapsed dramatically months ago. Trump has pushed hard for adding the mandate repeal to the tax-cut package. He tweeted the same suggestion on Nov. 3 just before he departed for his multi-nation Asian tour. In his latest tweet, he also urged slashing the top tax rate for high earners to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, despite criticism from Democrats that the Republican tax bills are deficit-expanding giveaways to the rich and corporations. The House retains the existing top tax rate in its bill, while the Senate proposes cutting it slightly to 38.5 percent. Trump is set to return to Washington on Tuesday. A White House aide confirmed that the president would speak to House Republicans on Thursday ahead of their expected tax bill vote. \u201cI am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.} We\u2019re getting close!\u201d Trump wrote in his Monday Twitter post. \u201cNow, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?\u201d he added. Since taking office in January, Trump has not scored a major legislative accomplishment, while frequently shifting positions and confusing lawmakers on Capitol Hill on various issues. Many Republicans view a win on overhauling the tax code as crucial to avoiding having to go to the voters in 2018\u2019s congressional elections with no achievements to show for a year in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. The clock is ticking for them. The House is expected to vote soon, perhaps on Thursday, on a tax bill approved last week at the committee level. House tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he was confident Republicans had the votes for passage. Brady told reporters in a Capitol hallway that including a repeal of the Obamacare individual healthcare mandate in the tax bill \u201cremains under consideration.\u201d  The Senate tax committee will debate its tax plan all week before heading home for the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday. When both chambers return near the end of November, they will have only 12 legislative days before the end of 2017. In that time span, Republicans hope to iron out differences between the two tax plans over the deduction for state and local taxes, the timing of a corporate tax rate cut and the future of the estate tax on inheritances. Each of the Republican tax plans would add about $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, another issue causing dissension among Republicans. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he hoped to have a tax bill ready in the week after Thanksgiving. Between now and then, an army of lobbyists will be pressuring lawmakers to protect favored special-interest tax breaks. On Dec. 8, a three-month extension of the spending authority for the federal government expires, requiring congressional action that could divert lawmakers from the tax overhaul. A lengthy amendment introduced on Monday to the Senate tax plan by Republican Orrin Hatch, chairman of the tax panel, would remove a provision that lets working Americans over 50 make tax-free catch-up contributions to their retirement plans. Democrats have kept up steady criticism of the Republican tax bills and how they were drafted. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate measure was developed in secret by a small group that held no public hearings and ignored Democrats. \u201cAnd the reason for such reckless haste is all too obvious: the product is a wretched one ... it is focused on the wealthy to the exclusion of the middle class,\u201d he said in a statement.

        "title": "Trump says open to bilateral Canada, Mexico pacts if NAFTA talks fail",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was open to bilateral trade pacts with either Canada or Mexico if a three-way deal cannot be reached to substantially revise the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Asked by a reporter if he could envision maintaining free trade with Canada if NAFTA talks sour with Mexico, Trump said: \u201cOh sure, absolutely. It\u2019s possible we won\u2019t be able to reach a deal with one or the other, but in the meantime we\u2019ll make a deal with one.\u201d Trump added that a \u201cvery creative\u201d deal was still possible to benefit all three countries. Trump\u2019s comments came at a White House meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in Washington to promote NAFTA\u2019s benefits as a new round of renegotiations began near Washington. Asked about Trump\u2019s comments at a news conference later, Trudeau said he was still optimistic about the chances of modernizing the 1994 trade pact. \u201cI continue to believe in NAFTA ... so saying, we are ready for anything, and we will continue to work diligently to protect Canadian interests,\u201d Trudeau said. Trudeau added that Canada was \u201cvery much aware of and very braced for\u201d Trump\u2019s unpredictability, but his government would work in a \u201cthoughtful, meaningful way towards getting a good deal.\u201d Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, speaking on Mexican radio, praised Trump\u2019s comments as \u201cvery balanced\u201d to include the possibility of a deal with either country and hold out hope for a creative solution. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday accused Trump\u2019s administration of trying to sabotage the talks with \u201cpoison pill proposals,\u201d including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production, and a \u201csunset clause\u201d to force regular negotiations. In his appearance with Trudeau, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d when asked whether NAFTA was doomed. \u201cIt\u2019s possible we won\u2019t be able to make a deal, and it\u2019s possible that we will,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can do the kind of changes that we need. We have to protect our workers, and in all fairness, the prime minister wants to protect Canada and his people also.\u201d U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, one of Trump\u2019s top trade advisers, downplayed the chances that a NAFTA termination would become necessary. \u201cWe don\u2019t hope it will, we don\u2019t desire that it will, we don\u2019t believe that it will, but it is at least a conceptual possibility as we go forward,\u201d Ross said. But U.S. and Mexican corporate chief executives gathered in Mexico City said they would be better off with no NAFTA than be saddled with a \u201cbad agreement.\u201d    Trade experts said the NAFTA talks were likely to stall in the face of aggressive U.S. attempts to sharply increase content requirements for autos and auto parts.  People briefed on U.S. proposals to be presented this week said Washington was seeking to sharply lift North American content threshold in car manufacturing. The proposals call for North American content overall to rise to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent. In addition, the United States wants to add a new 50 percent U.S.-specific content requirement, something that was not in the earlier agreements. \u201cThese will be met with widespread opposition from Canada and Mexico. I think it\u2019s just a bridge too far,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, the Asia Society\u2019s Washington policy director and former chief U.S. negotiator for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal canceled by Trump.      The U.S. side sees strengthening the rules of origin for the auto industry as a way to bring back some auto parts production, including electronics, from Asia. But Mexico strongly opposes a U.S.-specific content requirement, which would limit the growth of its own car industry.   The difficult issue of rules of origin will be addressed mostly at the end of the current talks, according to a schedule obtained by Reuters. The negotiations were extended on Wednesday by two days to Oct 17.  Other U.S. proposals opposed by Canada, Mexico and U.S. business interests include the five-year sunset provision, radical changes to NAFTA\u2019s dispute arbitration systems, changes to intellectual property provisions and new protections for U.S. seasonal produce growers. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday the three nations had completed their negotiations on company competition policy, reaching an agreement that goes beyond previous U.S. trade deals to ensure \u201ccertain rights and transparency under each nation\u2019s competition laws.\u201d  ",

        "text": "KARANGASEM, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia kept the airport on Bali closed on Tuesday as ash from an erupting volcano swept the holiday island, leaving thousands of tourists stranded as authorities tried to persuade villagers living nearby to leave their homes. A total of 443 flights, both domestic and international, were affected by the closure of the airport, about 60 km (37 miles) from Mount Agung which is spewing smoke and ash high into the sky.  Aircraft flight channels are covered with volcanic ash,  the transport ministry said in a statement, citing aviation navigation authorities. The airport - the second-biggest in Indonesia - will be closed at least until 7 a.m. on Wednesday (2300 GMT on Tuesday), the ministry said. Frustration at the airport was starting to boil over, with an estimated 2,000 people attempting to get refunds and reschedule tickets.  There are thousands of people stranded here at the airport,  said Nitin Sheth, a tourist from India.  They have to go to some other airport and they are trying to do that, but the government or authorities here are not helping.  Others were more relaxed.  No, there s not a lot of information ... very little. (But) it s all right. We re on holidays so it doesn t matter. We don t know what s going to happen but we can get back to the bar and have another drink,  said Matthew Radix from Perth. The airport operator said 201 international flights and 242 domestic ones had been hit. Ten alternative airports had been prepared for airlines to divert inbound flights, including in neighboring provinces, the operator said, adding it was helping people make alternative bookings and helping stranded travelers. The airport on Lombok island, to the east of Bali, had reopened, authorities said, as wind blew ash westward, towards the southern coast of Java island. Agung towers over eastern Bali to a height of just over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet). Its last eruption in 1963 killed more than 1,000 people and razed several villages. On Tuesday, however, life went on largely as normal in surrounding villages, with residents offering prayers as the volcano sent huge billows of ash and smoke into the sky. Some villagers who fled in September, when the alert was last raised to the highest level, have gone home despite government warnings. On Monday, authorities said 100,000 residents living near the volcano had been ordered to get out of an 8-10 km (5-6 mile) exclusion zone, warning a larger eruption was  imminent .  While the population in the area has been estimated at anywhere between 63,000 and 140,000, just over 29,000 people were registered at emergency centers, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Disaster Mitigation Agency.  Not all people in the danger zone are prepared to take refuge,  he said.  There are still a lot of residents staying in their homes.  Indonesia s Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation Center has warned that an eruption of a size similar to that seen in 1963 could send rocks bigger than a fist flying a distance of up to 8 km (5 miles), and volcanic gas a distance of 10 km (6 miles) within three minutes. Monitoring has shown the northeastern part of Agung s peak had swollen in recent weeks  indicating there is fairly strong pressure toward the surface , the center said.

        "text": "SITTWE, Myanmar (Reuters) - Rohingya Muslims who return to Myanmar after fleeing to Bangladesh are unlikely to be able to reclaim their land, and may find their crops have been harvested and sold by the government, according to officials and plans seen by Reuters. Nearly 600,000 Rohingya have crossed the border since Aug. 25, when coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts sparked a ferocious counteroffensive by the Myanmar army. The United Nations says killings, arson and rape carried out by troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist mobs since late August amount to a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya. Civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has no control over the military, has pledged that anyone sheltering in Bangladesh who can prove they were Myanmar residents can return. Reuters has interviewed six Myanmar officials involved with repatriation and resettlement plans. While the plans are not yet finalised, their comments reflect the government s thinking on how Suu Kyi s repatriation pledge will be implemented. Jamil Ahmed, who spoke to Reuters at a refugee camp in Bangladesh, is one of many Rohingya who hope to go back. Describing how he fled his home in northern Rakhine state in late August, Ahmed said one of the few things he grabbed was a stack of papers - land contracts and receipts - that might prove ownership of the fields and crops he was leaving behind.  I didn t carry any ornaments or jewels,  said the 35-year-old.  I ve only got these documents. In Myanmar, you need to present documents to prove everything.  The stack of papers, browning and torn at the edges, may not be enough, however, to regain the land in Kyauk Pan Du village, where he grew potatoes, chilli plants, almonds and rice.  It depends on them. There is no land ownership for those who don t have citizenship,  said Kyaw Lwin, agriculture minister in Rakhine state, when asked in an interview whether refugees who returned to Myanmar could reclaim land and crops. Despite his land holdings, Myanmar does not recognize Ahmed as a citizen. Nearly all the more than 1 million Rohingya who lived in Myanmar before the recent exodus are stateless, despite many tracing their families in the country for generations. Officials have made plans to harvest, and possibly sell, thousands of acres of crops left behind by the fleeing Rohingya, according to state government documents reviewed by Reuters. Myanmar also intends to settle most refugees who return to Rakhine state in new  model villages , rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach criticized in the past by the United Nations as effectively creating permanent camps. The government has not asked for help from any international agencies, who are calling for any repatriation to be voluntary and to the refugees  place of origin. The exodus of 589,000 Rohingya - and about 30,000 non-Muslims - from the conflict zone in northern Rakhine has left some 71,500 acres of planted rice paddy abandoned and in need of harvesting by January, according to plans drawn up by state officials. Tables in the documents, reviewed by Reuters, divide the land into paddy sown by  national races  - meaning Myanmar citizens - or  Bengalis,  a term widely used in Myanmar to refer to the Rohingya, but which they reject as implying they are illegal migrants from Bangladesh. Kyaw Lwin, the state minister, confirmed the plans, and said there was a total of 45,000 acres of  ownerless Bengali land . Two dozen combine harvesters operated by officials from the agriculture ministry will begin cutting stalks this month in areas under military control. The machines will be able to harvest about 14,400 acres according to official calculations contained in the plans. It is unclear what will become of the remaining crop, but officials told Reuters they would try to harvest all the paddy, recruiting additional labor to harvest manually if necessary. An acre of paddy in Myanmar typically makes more than $300 at market, meaning the state will gain millions of dollars worth of rice. The harvested rice will be transported to government stores, where it would either be donated to those displaced by the conflict or sold, Rakhine state secretary Tin Maung Swe told Reuters by phone.  The land was abandoned. There is no one to reap that, so the government ordered to harvest it,  he said. Human Rights Watch (HRW) deputy Asia director Phil Robertson, said the government should at least guarantee that the rice would be used for humanitarian support and not for profit.  You can t call a rice crop  ownerless  just because you used violence and arson to drive the owners out of the country,  he said. Many refugees are fearful to return and are skeptical of Myanmar s guarantees. Those who do decide to cross back into Myanmar will first be received at one of two centers, according to government plans reviewed by Reuters, before mostly being relocated to model villages. International donors, who have fed and cared for more than 120,000 mostly Rohingya  internally displaced persons  (IDPs) in supposedly temporary camps in Rakhine since violence in 2012, have told Myanmar that they will not support more camps, according to aid workers and diplomats.  The establishment of new temporary camps or camp-like settlements carries many risks, including that the returnees and IDPs could end up being confined to these camps for a long time,  said U.N. spokesman Stanislav Saling in an emailed response. Satellite imagery shows 288 villages, mostly Rohingya settlements, have been fully or partially razed by fires since Aug. 25, according to HRW.  Refugees say the army and Buddhist mobs were responsible for most of the arson. The government says Rohingya militants and even residents themselves burned the homes for propaganda. The hamlets where Rohingya farmers lived were  not systematic , and so should be rebuilt in smaller settlements of 1,000 households set out in straight rows to enable development, said Soe Aung, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement.  In some villages there are three houses here, four houses over there. For example, there s no road for fire engines when fire burns the villages,  Soe Aung said. Those who decide to cross back into Myanmar will first be received at one of two centers, according to government plans reviewed by Reuters. At the centers, officials said, the returnees will fill out a 16-point form that will be cross-checked with local authorities  records. Immigration officials have for years visited Rohingya households at least annually for checks, photographing family members. For refugees who lost all their documents, the government would compare their photos to those that immigration authorities have on file, said Myint Kyaing, the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population. Officials will accept as evidence  national verification  cards handed out in an ongoing government effort to register Rohingya that falls short of offering them citizenship. The card has been widely rejected by Rohingya community leaders, who say they treat life-long residents like new immigrants.  We are not going to go back like this,  said Mushtaq Ahmed, 57, a farmer from Myin Hlut village now living in the Tenkhali refugee camp in Bangladesh, where Jamil Ahmed is also staying.  If I can go back to my house, and get my land back, only then I will go. We invested all our money into those paddy fields. They are killing so many of us with swords and bullets, and killing the rest of us like this.  ",

        "title": "Clinton's lead over Trump slips after Florida shooting: Reuters/Ipsos poll",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump chipped away at Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead in the presidential race this week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, as the candidates clashed over how to respond to the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The poll, conducted from Monday to Friday, showed Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, with a 10.7 point lead among likely voters over Trump, her likely Republican rival in the November presidential election. That\u2019s down from a lead of 14.3 points for Clinton on Sunday, the day an American-born shooter who declared allegiance to militant group Islamic State killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Trump seized on the attack to sharpen his security proposals, saying he would block immigration to the United States from any country with a \u201cproven history of terrorism\u201d against America and its allies if elected. The pledge fine-tuned an earlier vow, made after the attacks last year in Paris and California, to ban the entry of all Muslims into the United States. He also called for measures to make it more difficult for suspected terrorists to obtain firearms, veering from the Republican Party\u2019s general opposition to gun control. While Trump\u2019s comments on both Muslims and guns dismayed some Republican elites, they may have cheered some voters. Some 45 percent of Americans said they supported Trump\u2019s idea to suspend Muslim immigration, up from 41.9 percent at the start of the month, according to the poll. Meanwhile, about 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats and Republicans, said they wanted to see at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, up from 60 percent in similar polls in 2013 and 2014.   Clinton focused her response to the Orlando attack on the need to boost intelligence gathering and defeat Islamic State and what she called \u201cradical jihadist terrorism,\u201d while warning against demonizing Muslim-Americans. She also repeated her calls for tougher gun control measures, including a ban on assault weapons. As usual after a major attack, \u201cterrorism\u201d jumped to the top concern among all adults in the poll - rising above the economy, health care and other major issues. The poll\u2019s five-day average showed that 45.5 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton, while 34.8 percent supported Trump, and another 19.7 percent did not support either candidate. On Sunday, Clinton\u2019s support was at 46.6 percent, versus Trump\u2019s 32.3 percent. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English with adults living in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. The political horserace poll included 1,133 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of the poll\u2019s accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points. ",

        "title": "Spain sees Russian interference in Catalonia separatist vote",
        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Madrid believes Russian-based groups used online social media to heavily promote Catalonia s independence referendum last month in an attempt to destabilize Spain, Spanish ministers said on Monday. Spain s defense and foreign ministers said they had evidence that state and private-sector Russian groups, as well as groups in Venezuela, used Twitter, Facebook and other Internet sites to massively publicize the separatist cause and swing public opinion behind it in the run-up to the Oct. 1 referendum. Catalonia s separatist leaders have denied that Russian interference helped them in the vote.  What we know today is that much of this came from Russian territory,  Spanish Defence Minister Maria Dolores de Cospedal said of Russian-based internet support.   These are groups that, public and private, are trying to influence the situation and create instability in Europe,  she told reporters at a meeting of EU foreign and defense ministers in Brussels. Asked if Madrid was certain of the accusations, Spanish  Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis, also at the meeting, said:  Yes, we have proof.  Dastis said Spain had detected false accounts on social media, half of which were traced back to Russia and another 30 percent to Venezuela, created to amplify the benefits of the separatist cause by re-publishing messages and posts.  Ramon Tremosa, the EU lawmaker for the PDeCat party of Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont, repeated on Monday that Russian interference had played no part in the referendum.  Those that say Russia is helping Catalonia are those that have helped the Russian fleet in recent years, despite the EU s boycott,  Tremosa tweeted, referring to Spanish media reports that Spain was allowing Russian warships to refuel at its  ports. Those who voted in the referendum opted overwhelmingly for independence. But turnout was only about 43 percent as Catalans who favor remaining part of Spain mainly boycotted the ballot. The separatist vote has plunged Spain, the euro zone s fourth-biggest economy, into its worst constitutional crisis since its return to democracy in the 1970s.  Dastis said he had raised the issue with the Kremlin. Moscow has repeatedly denied any such interference and accuses the West of a campaign to discredit Russia. NATO believes Moscow is involved in a deliberately ambiguous strategy of information warfare and disinformation to try to divide the West and break its unity over economic sanctions imposed on Russia following its 2014 annexation of Crimea.  U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia interfered in the U.S. election to try to help President Donald Trump defeat rival Hillary Clinton by hacking and releasing emails and spreading propaganda via social media. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who attended the EU meeting in Brussels, declined to comment on Spain s accusations, but the alliance s top commander said last week that Russian interference was a concern.   NATO s Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Curtis Scaparotti said  Russian malign influence  was trying to sway elections and other decisions in the West, describing it as a  destabilization campaign,  although he did not directly address the Catalonia referendum.

        "title": "Campaign aims to register a million U.S. Muslims voters in anti-Trump move",
        "text": "FALLS CHURCH, Va. (Reuters) - U.S. Muslim leaders hope to register a million voters from within their community to help combat what they say is the anti-Muslim stance of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The United States has only about 3.3 million Muslims, but campaign organizers say Muslim voters could have an outsize impact in swing states that are key to the November general election, such as Virginia and Florida. \u201cWe want the Muslim community to understand that if you give up your rights voluntarily, no one will come and give it back to you,\u201d said Osama Abu Irshaid, a member of the board of the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations, which is spearheading the drive. Imams have been asked to encourage their congregations to register to vote. Organizers have sent canvassers to college campuses, bus stations and gas stations in Muslim neighborhoods. The campaign began in December and is part of an effort among U.S. Muslims to combat an \u201cunprecedented rise in Islamophobia,\u201d said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). CAIR\u2019s database showed that 300,000 Muslims had registered since November, he said. Awad said anti-Muslim sentiment had grown since the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, last year that authorities have said was inspired by Islamist militants, and due to comments by Trump. He has called for a ban on Muslim immigrants. Campaign volunteers were outside the Dar al-Hijrah mosque in suburban Washington this month to get worshippers to register. \u201cI was thinking quite a long time to register but this time especially ... I really believed that I have to,\u201d said Sadat Najmi as he filled out a registration form. Najmi, a U.S. citizen since 1988, said Trump had motivated him to sign up for the first time. U.S. Muslim backers of Trump said they were trying to build their own coalitions in swing states.  Baltimore businessman Sajid Tarar said he launched American Muslims for Trump because he favored Trump\u2019s stance on combating radical Islam. \u201cISIS (an acronym for the Islamic State), al Qaeda, Taliban, they have killed more Muslims than anything else, and that\u2019s a message Muslims need to hear and understand,\u201d he said, referring to various militant groups. Michael Cohen, co-chair of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump, which aims to mobilize minority support, said Muslim Americans were equally worried about violence at home and abroad. Trump is \u201cthe only candidate who will enhance our national security, bring jobs back to America and fix our ailing economy,\u201d he said in an email. ",

        "title": "Exclusive: After Grenfell fire, same builders rehired to replace dangerous cladding, Reuters finds",
        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Some building companies that installed dangerous cladding on social housing blocks across Britain are now winning new contracts following the Grenfell Tower blaze to remove their original work and install panels that can pass safety tests, a Reuters review shows. The safety of high-rise buildings has come under scrutiny since the Grenfell disaster in June which killed 71 people. The British government, which ordered a series of tests to establish which types of cladding panels met fire safety rules, said those on the London tower block did not comply. A Reuters review identified 65 other towers with cladding of a type that was approved by local building inspectors, but which government tests found did not comply with the statutory regulations. The towers were clad by major builders including French groups Engie (ENGIE.PA) and Bouygues (BOUY.PA), and Britain s Galliford Try (GFRD.L), Forrest, Wates Group, Rydon Group and Willmott Dixon.  The Reuters review was based on publicly available building planning permission documents, which detail the work carried out and the materials used, as well as visits to the towers and statements from housing providers and builders.  For 29 of the buildings, the same builders that installed the cladding have won new contracts to remove or replace the panels, according to the owners of the buildings, who said they were paying millions of pounds for the work. The rehired companies are Willmott Dixon, Wates and Engie.  Willmott Dixon and Rydon said their cladding work complied with safety regulations, but did not say how. Wates, Bouygues, Galliford Try and Engie declined to answer questions on whether their work complied with regulations.  Following the Grenfell tragedy, we have been supporting the relevant councils, and removed the cladding where requested. Our primary concern is to ensure all residents in these buildings are secure and safe,  said an Engie spokesman. In the wake of Grenfell, the government ordered an independent review into building regulations and fire safety, and the way the rules are complied with and enforced. The review is due to report its findings early next year.  The 65 towers in question are owned by local governments - known as councils - or housing associations, which are publicly funded, non-profit bodies that provide housing intended for low-income people.  At the time all the panels were installed, building inspectors - usually council workers but sometimes staff of inspection firms licensed by councils - signed off the work as being compliant with safety regulations, according to the owners of the blocks and the building firms involved.  Chris Blythe, CEO of trade body the Chartered Institute of Building, said builders hired to carry out high-rise cladding projects used many subcontractors and advisers, and that this could lead to misunderstandings, with one party thinking another had ensured work was compliant.   The business model we have is almost geared up for potential failure,  said Blythe, adding that if fewer parties were involved, there would be less room for confusion over responsibilities. For all 65 blocks identified by Reuters, the councils or council-licensed firms whose inspectors approved the work as compliant either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment while the independent review was ongoing. The government has already acknowledged problems with the inspection process, with Fire Service Minister Nick Hurd saying in July there was a  system failure, built up over many years  in the area of regulation enforcement.  However a spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), which ordered the cladding tests and regulations review, said sign-off by inspectors did not absolve contractors of responsibility to meet safety standards.  Cladding systems are panels put up on the outside of buildings to improve their aesthetics and energy efficiency.  Since 2006, building regulations have required materials used in cladding on high-rise buildings to be able to pass the  BS 8414 test  which measures combustibility. After Grenfell, the DCLG ordered a series BS 8414 tests to establish which types of cladding met fire safety rules. It said that, of around 600 social housing towers in England that had cladding, 161 had systems of a type that failed the tests. But it did not name the towers. Reuters identified 60 blocks which, since 2006, had been cladded with aluminum panels with polyethylene cores - a form of cladding that failed the DCLG s test, and which the prime minister and three other ministers have said breaches safety regulations when used in tall buildings. Five other blocks, also cladded since 2006, had combinations of panel and insulation board that failed the test.  The three companies that were rehired to replace the cladding on 29 of the towers had all originally fitted aluminum panels with polyethylene cores.  Wates secured contracts with Westminster council in central London and One Manchester housing association to reclad 14 towers it covered in 2007 and 2010.  Willmott Dixon has received contracts from Oxford council and west London s Octavia housing association to replace panels it installed on three blocks early this year and in 2013. Engie has been hired by Barnet Homes in north London to replace cladding on three blocks it clad in 2012. It also has a contract to remove cladding from nine blocks in Salford, north England, owned by the local council that it clad around 2016.  Engie has been hired to remove panels from 12 blocks it clad in 2012 and 2016, and install new cladding on three of them. The contracts are with housing associations Barnet Homes in north London, and Pendleton Together in Salford, north England.  The three building companies declined to comment on how much the contracts were worth. However five of the six owners of the buildings told Reuters how much money they were paying for the work. Oxford council said about 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) for its two blocks; Octavia said about 2 million pounds for one block, Westminster council said about 6 million pounds for six blocks; and Barnet Homes said 8.2 million pounds for three blocks.  Salford council said it expects to spend up to 25 million pounds in total for the removal and recladding work on nine blocks. Engie has been hired to remove its original panels, but the recladding contractor has not yet been named. One Manchester declined to comment on how much its recladding work would cost.  The building companies declined to comment on the figures. Jonathan Raynes a partner with law firm Steptoe & Johnson said councils or housing associations who paid contractors for cladding that turned out to be non-compliant could sue the contractor for the cost of replacing the cladding.   The contract will almost certainly have a provision that says the contractor must build in accordance with statutory requirements,  he said, adding that if the contract didn t say this, a requirement to act legally could be deemed implicit. Raynes and Adam Creasey, a solicitor with Lewis Nedas, said the fact building inspectors signed off on work did not remove the builder s responsibility to adhere to building regulations. Creasey added a builder could conceivably try and reclaim any money awarded against it from the body which provided the inspection sign-off.  Reuters contacted the owners of all 65 blocks with cladding of a type that failed the government tests - seven local councils and 10 housing associations - and asked if they were considering legal action against contractors to recover the money spent on cladding, or to cover the cost of replacement. Only Camden council in north London said it was considering legal action. It declined to elaborate on its plans. Barnet said it was not seeking any money from its contractor, Engie, over the original cladding but declined to say why. Westminster council said it was not seeking any money from its contractor, Wates, because it believed the original work was compliant with the rules in place at the time.  Oxford council said it had not sought money from Willmott Dixon over the original cladding and would only consider taking legal advice after the independent review was completed.  One Manchester said it would not talk about seeking recompense while the review was on-going.  ",

        "text": "ALMATY (Reuters) - Kazakhstan is to change its official alphabet for the third time in less than 100 years in what is seen in part as symbolic move to underline its independence. President Nursultan Nazarbayev ordered his office on Thursday to prepare for a switch to a Latin-based alphabet from a Cyrillic one, distancing itself, at least graphically, from Russia. The oil-rich former Soviet republic of 18 million has very close ties with Moscow, its main trading partner, but is also wary of Russia s ambitions to maintain its political influence throughout the region. Kazakh, a Turkic language, used to be written in Arabic script until the 1920s when the Soviet Union briefly introduced a Latin alphabet for it. This was later replaced by a Cyrillic one in 1940, based on the Russian alphabet. Part of the latest switch relates to modern technology. The currently used Cyrillic alphabet has 42 symbols, making it cumbersome to use with digital devices - a standard Kazakh keyboard utilizes almost all number keys in addition to letter and punctuation keys. The latest version of the proposed Latin alphabet works around that by using apostrophe signs to modify letters. The country s official name would thus be spelled as Qazaqstan Respy blikasy. According to a statement published by Nazarbayev s office, he has ordered his chief of staff to draft an executive order introducing the new alphabet. The switch will be gradual, it said. Alhough Kazakh has been the state language since Kazakhstan became independent in 1991, only 62 percent of the population said they were fluent in both written and spoken Kazakh during a the most recent national census in 2009. Russian is more widespread with 85 percent claiming fluency in the same census. Russian is recognized as an official language in Kazakhstan. Several other Turkic nations, including Turkey itself, ex-Soviet Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, have also switched to Latin alphabets. ",

        "title": "Democrats flex muscles as Congress confronts a government shutdown",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats have a rare chance to win major concessions in a U.S. Congress they do not control by taking advantage of a battle within the Republican Party over keeping the government open.  With a Friday deadline looming when most funding for federal agencies runs out, Democrats finally have some clout. But their power is strongest while the Republicans in Congress remain fractured and fighting.  The showdown with Republicans could come to a head on Thursday when Democrats are expected to press their demands to President Donald Trump at a White House meeting. For Trump, the complex, and very public, battle over the shutdown will also be a demonstration of his ability to deliver on a central 2016 campaign promise of adding billions of dollars to the U.S. military budget. That issue is at the core of Republicans\u2019 behind-the-scenes negotiations with Democrats. Most Republicans want a defense buildup. But many also want to limit government spending. While many Democrats also support bolstering defense, they insist on raising spending on non-defense programs too.  Democrats\u2019 top two demands include passage of legislation that has eluded them for 16 years: protecting from deportation nearly 700,000 young people known as \u201cDreamers,\u201d whose parents brought them illegally to the United States as children. The Democrats also want to shore up Obamacare by reversing Trump\u2019s decision to stop monthly subsidy payments to insurance companies offering healthcare policies to lower-income people. Democrats will enter the White House meeting knowing their support is crucial to Senate Republicans passing any spending bills. Republicans control the chamber by 52-48, but need 60 vote for passage of most spending measures. While a partial government shutdown would keep emergency services and the military mainly operating, thousands of operations would be suspended, such as the operation of national parks. Republicans have clear control of the House of Representatives. But a core of conservative Republicans who consistently vote against funding bills in their drive for smaller government could balk. Democrats have a history of strongly supporting stopgap funding bills, providing the cushion for victory in the Republican House. Conservative Republicans said on Tuesday they would try to pass temporary spending bills without House Democrats\u2019 support. If so, it is unclear whether such a bill could clear the Senate, where Democratic votes are necessary to pass most bills.   There is another wild card for both parties in Thursday\u2019s meeting: Trump. Democrats will test the unpredictable president to see whether he is willing to go the bipartisan route in order to keep federal agencies running smoothly or whether he will be in a confrontational mood. In May, angry he did not win money to build his promised wall along the border with Mexico, Trump said the United States needed a \u201cgood shutdown\u201d to force his agenda on Congress. Just last week, he wrote on Twitter about the spending bills: \u201cI don\u2019t see a deal.\u201d Democrats are counting on the bipartisan Trump showing up, betting that he and fellow Republicans in Congress do not want to leave the immigration legislation, popularly known as the Dreamers Act, to fester until a March deadline, so close to the 2018 congressional election season. Chuck Schumer, Senate minority leader, and Nancy Pelosi, House minority leader, are calculating that voters\u2019 wrath would rain down on Republicans if the government lights go out. Republicans would blame Democrats. At a news conference last Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that if Democrats vote against the temporary spending bill because they have not won their demands, \u201cthen they will have chosen to shut the government down.\u201d Republicans already are trying to exploit possible differences among Democrats over whether to link support for the stopgap spending bill to the immigration measure. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said she expected Democrats to vote for the government funding bill this week, telling Reuters in an interview that while it \u201cis important to all of us\u201d to take care of the Dreamers, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should shut the government down.\u201d Senator Dick Durbin, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Democrat, told the Washington Post last week he would oppose any spending bill if Congress had not first taken care of the Dreamers. On Tuesday, Schumer noted there were \u201cgood negotiations\u201d under way on the immigration measure. This week\u2019s vote to keep the government operating on temporary funding is likely to be the first of a three-step process that could stretch to Jan. 31. A second step would be another short-term funding bill, followed by one to fund the government through the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials have kicked off a new round of raids intended to deport hundreds of Central American mothers and children who have entered the country illegally, according to a legal group that works with the immigrants. Immigration enforcement officers as of Friday had arrested about 40 women and children encompassing at least 18 Central American family groups in Texas, North Carolina, South Dakota and possibly other states, said Laura Lichter, an immigration lawyer and a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Reuters reported on May 12 that the raids were planned for May and June and likely would be the largest deportation sweep targeting immigrant families by the administration of President Barack Obama this year after similar raids in which 121 people were arrested over two days in January. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokeswoman Jennifer Elzea declined to confirm that the new round of raids had begun but defended the administration\u2019s deportation operations as a whole. \u201cWe stress that these operations are limited to those who were apprehended at the border after January 1, 2014, have been ordered removed by an immigration court, and have no pending appeal or pending claim for asylum,\u201d Elzea said. The immigrants arrested in the latest raids have been sent to two ICE detention centers in Texas, according to Belle Woods, a spokeswoman for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. The deportation operations are intended to deter illegal immigration from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala and curb crossings of the U.S.-Mexican border by Central Americans, U.S. officials have said. Lichter said ICE was not following its own policy in the raids. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing we saw in January. These people deserve asylum, but didn\u2019t get a proper chance to have their cases heard,\u201d Lichter said. The issue of illegal immigration has figured prominently in the U.S. presidential campaign, with presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump promising to deport all roughly 11 million people who are in the United States illegally. The White House on May 13 defended its deportation policy after complaints from Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and congressional leaders that the sweep targeting Central American illegal immigrants is inhumane. \u201cI\u2019m against large-scale raids that tear families apart and sow fear in communities,\u201d Clinton said at the time.

        "title": "Burundi rejects International Criminal Court war crimes investigation",
        "text": "AMSTERDAM/NAIROBI (Reuters) - Burundi said on Friday it will refuse to cooperate with an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into war crimes  prosecutors suspect were committed by forces loyal to President Pierre Nkurunziza s government against their political opponents. The court ordered a formal investigation on Thursday into crimes committed between April 2015 to October 2017. But experts say it will be hard for ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to gather evidence without support from Burundi s government, which last month became the first to withdraw from the Hague-based court amid waning support from African nations. An earlier ICC case in Kenya fell apart due to opposition from the government of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Like Burundi, Kenya and South Africa have threatened to withdraw from the court, arguing that it disproportionately targets Africans.    The government rejects that decision (to investigate) and reiterates its firm determination that it will not cooperate,  said Burundi s Justice Minister Aimee Laurentine Kanyana.   Unrest has gripped Burundi since Nkurunziza said in April 2015 he would seek a third term in office, triggering protests and a crackdown by security forces. He won re-election that July but opponents boycotted the vote, saying his decision to stand violated the constitution and the terms of a peace agreement that had ended a war in the central African country. The ICC says that under international law it still has jurisdiction over crimes committed while Burundi was a member.    Judges said Bensouda should investigate whether crimes against humanity were committed including murder, torture, rape and persecution. Government forces are suspected to have killed more than 1,000 people and displaced 400,000 during the crackdown. Human rights groups say the number killed could be far higher. Human rights groups and opposition politicians in Burundi welcomed the court s decision. Charles Nditije, the exiled head of Burundi s opposition platform CNARED, called the move  a victory for justice .... for those who want the return of peace and rule of law to Burundi.  Armel Niyongere, a Burundian lawyer representing families of the victims, said he would assist Bensouda s investigation.  Legal experts said Bensouda may be unable to bring any suspects to the Hague as long as Nkurunziza remains in power.  I suspect that it will be very challenging for the ICC to access ... evidence in Burundi  said Berlin-based international criminal justice lawyer Angela Mudukuti. Bensouda s decision was courageous and she will likely seek to use evidence obtained by interviewing refugees who have fled to neighboring Tanzania and Rwanda, said Karine Bonneau, a senior official at the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights.  She had very little choice but to open an investigation given the gravity of the crimes,  she said. Others said the prosecution was largely symbolic. Bensouda s job is in part to deter future crimes, said Thijs Bouwknegt, an Africa expert at the Netherlands  Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies.  If she acts like some super human rights watchdog and names and shames people I think this may be effective,  he said. ",

        "title": "Sanders blocks Obama nominee to lead FDA, citing industry ties",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said on Tuesday he has placed a hold on President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to head the Food and Drug Administration, claiming he is too close to the pharmaceutical industry to be an impartial regulator. The move by the U.S. senator from Vermont comes one day after Democratic Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts also placed a hold on the nomination until the agency agrees to reform its process for approving opioid painkillers. The nominee, Dr. Robert Califf, is a cardiologist and researcher who joined the FDA a year ago as a deputy commissioner. He previously held senior positions at Duke University, where he founded a large academic research center that received more than half of its funding from the drug industry. \u201cDr. Califf\u2019s extensive ties to the pharmaceutical industry give me no reason to believe that he would make the FDA work for ordinary Americans, rather than just the CEOs of pharmaceutical companies,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. A \u201chold\u201d is a procedure by which a senator can prevent a measure from being voted on by the full Senate. Peter Pitts, a former associate commissioner for external affairs at the FDA who is now president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, said no hold has ever killed a vote on an FDA commissioner and he does not expect it to now. \u201cIt would be very undemocratic not to let the other senators have their say,\u201d he said. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions voted earlier this month to confirm Califf as FDA commissioner, a position open since Dr. Margaret Hamburg stepped down last February. Kevin Griffis, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, said Califf \u201cis the right person with the right experience to build on the FDA\u2019s unsurpassed record of protecting public health while encouraging innovation and the introduction of new life-saving therapies to the market.\u201d He added: \u201cWe would like to see him confirmed as quickly as possible.\u201d On Monday, HHS said that addressing the opioid crisis was \u201ca top priority.\u201d Markey wants opioid approval matters to be reviewed by an FDA advisory committee and believes the committee should consider the risk of addiction and abuse during the approval process. He also wants the agency to rescind approval of OxyContin for children and convene an advisory panel to guide that process. Sanders said he shared Markey\u2019s concerns about the FDA\u2019s approach to opioid painkillers. Too many Americans are dying from what has become an \u201copioid epidemic,\u201d he said in a statement. U.S. deaths from drug overdoses hit a record in 2014, increasing 6.5 percent to 47,055, propelled by prescription painkiller and heroin abuse, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA does not control drug prices, but Sanders said that \u201cat a time when millions of Americans cannot afford to purchase the prescription drugs they require, we need a leader at the FDA who is prepared to stand up to the drug companies.\u201d Last year, he said, one in five Americans, or 35 million people, could not afford to fill their prescriptions. Sanders has made healthcare a key theme of his campaign to be the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate in the November election. He is competing with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley. Califf is widely expected to ultimately be confirmed as FDA commissioner. \u201cI don\u2019t think Senator Sanders\u2019 hold will slow the process down,\u201d Pitts said. Califf will need to meet with Sanders and reassure him of the FDA\u2019s independence, Pitts said. \u201cIn the meantime,\u201d he added, \u201cHe\u2019s made his point.\u201d  (Reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by David Alexander, Jeffrey Benkoe, Jonathan Oatis and David Gregorio) SAP is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of Reuters News Agency.",

        "title": "Some German parties reject far-right's candidate for parliamentary post",
        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Three of Germany s main parties have raised objections to the far-right Alternative for Germany s (AfD) candidate for the post of parliamentary vice president, highlighting its political isolation despite a strong showing in the Sept. 24 election. The anti-immigrant AfD swept into the Bundestag lower house of parliament with 12.6 percent of the vote, making it the third largest parliamentary group. It is the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag since the 1950s. All parties represented in the Bundestag are entitled to have their own vice president of the parliament, who chairs sessions, sets the agenda and calls lawmakers to order where necessary. But the candidates need to be approved by an absolute majority of all sitting lawmakers.  The Greens, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the radical Left Party spoke out against the AfD s nomination of 75-year-old Albrecht Glaser, who has called Islam a political ideology rather than a religion, and said Muslims should not have the right to freedom of religion as Islam did not respect that freedom. Their objections demonstrated the difficulties the AfD may face in pushing its agenda - ranging from immigration and an insistence that Islam does not belong in Germany to problems it sees in the euro zone. The parliamentary vice presidents are generally elected in the first session of the lower house, which is expected to take place by Oct. 24 at the latest. Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservative bloc has so far not taken a public position on the AfD s choice. Michael Grosse-Broemer, the head of the conservatives  parliamentary group, declined to comment on Monday. Carsten Schneider, parliamentary manager of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), told Reuters TV he did not know Glaser personally, did not want to pre-judge him and would seek to clarify with other parliamentary groups whether they could get to know Glaser in some format first. However, Dietmar Bartsch, head of the Left s parliamentary group, and Cem Ozdemir of the Greens told newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung they would not vote Glaser into the position.  Whoever questions the freedom of religion has disqualified themselves,  Ozdemir said. A representative of the FDP also expressed doubts about the AfD s choice of Glaser. Glaser was a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) for 40 years until quitting in 2012 and helping to found the AfD in 2013. Alexander Gauland, head of the AfD s parliamentary group, told Reuters his party was sticking to its choice of candidate.  We all share Mr Glaser s opinion so it s completely clear,  he said. Gauland provoked outrage by saying during the election campaign that Germans should be proud of their World War Two soldiers. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told mass-selling Bild newspaper that Gauland was not conscious enough of the feelings of other European countries who suffered under Nazi rule.  I won t accuse the whole AfD or its voters of being total Nazis - that would be simplistic - but if you re head of a group in Germany s Bundestag you need to consider how Germany s neighbors feel. And Gauland doesn t do that,  he said. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - TransCanada Corp, Canada\u2019s No.2 pipeline operator, will make a final investment decision on its Keystone XL project by December, the company said on Friday as it reported a better-than-expected profit. The December timeline is the first time the company has publicly set a deadline about making an investment decision for the project since U.S. President Donald Trump approved Keystone XL in March, reversing a decision by Barack Obama. The investment decision will be based on shipper demand and a regulatory outcome from the U.S. state of Nebraska, through which the project passes, Paul Miller, executive vice president and president of liquid pipeline at TransCanada, said in a conference call after the release of quarterly results.  \u201cOur assessment of these factors will really drive our investment decision when we get into that November-December time frame,\u201d he said. While TransCanada has \u201cgood support\u201d from existing shippers, including those who departed after Keystone XL\u2019s 2015 rejection, it is seeking new entrants and wants a \u201csignificant\u201d level of commitment, Miller said, without specifying precise figures. TransCanada launched an open season on Thursday for additional commitments for Keystone XL. The expansion increases the capacity of the current Keystone system from Canada\u2019s oil-producing Alberta province to the Gulf of Mexico. TransCanada also said on Friday it will invest about C$160 million ($129 million) to expand the capacity of the Canadian natural gas mainline, a move that could help producers who have been denied an export route after this week\u2019s cancellation of the Pacific NorthWest project. Malaysian state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd [PETR.UL], or Petronas, announced scrapping of its Pacific NorthWest liquefied natural gas terminal in Canada\u2019s British Columbia province this week, due to depressed commodity prices. TransCanada, which spent at least C$500 million to build the pipeline connecting gas wells to the terminal, said it would be reimbursed this year for costs associated with the project.  The company\u2019s profits on Friday were helped by strength in its U.S. natural gas pipelines and liquids pipelines units. Revenue from the company\u2019s U.S. natural gas pipelines unit more than doubled to C$879 million. Its net income attributable to shareholders rose to C$881 million, or C$1.01 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, compared with C$365 million, or 52 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 76 Canadian cents per share beating analysts\u2019 estimate of 69 Canadian cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose nearly 17 percent to C$3.22 billion. ",

        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Wednesday it was making a  stop-gap  purchase of fuel so as to provide clean water to one million people in the Yemeni cities of Hodeidah and Taiz for one month. The fuel shortage in Yemen has become  critical  under the Saudi-led coalition s blockade, partially lifted this week, leaving water systems in nine cities without fuel to run pumps, ICRC spokeswoman Iolanda Jaquemet said.  As a last resort and in light of the large and urgent needs...we are purchasing fuel to supply the urban water corporations in Hodeidah and Taiz with fuel, enough to operate their water pumps for one month,  Jaquemet told Reuters. The ICRC is buying 750,000 liters of fuel for the two cities, she said, calling it  an exceptional stop-gap measure . The lack of fuel has a  cascading impact on several vital sectors  - water and sanitation as well as health and food, as prices have risen sharply, she said. Fuel is needed to transport goods and run hospital generators and maintain cold chains for vaccines and medicines. Saudi Arabia and its allies closed air, land and sea access to the Arabian Peninsula country on Nov. 6, to stop what it calls a flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran. The action came after Saudi Arabia intercepted a missile fired towards its capital Riyadh.  Iran has denied supplying the Houthis with weapons. A first aid ship, carrying 5,500 tonnes of flour docked in the Houthi-controlled port of Hodeidah on the Red Sea on Sunday.  Humanitarian aid has started coming in and it s a very welcome first step but we need commercial imports,  Jaquemet said.  ICRC trucks have brought medical material into Yemen this week, mainly badly needed dialysis material, she said.  A shipment of kits for treating trauma patients is expected to berth in Aden shortly, she added.  These war-wounded kits will enable surgeries for over 400 people and are to be distributed to 10 hospitals and 15 field hospitals across north and south Yemen.  The ICRC is stepping up assistance to combat an outbreak of diphtheria in Ibb governorate, including protective equipment for hospital staff to avoid spread of the highly-infectious respiratory disease, she said. Some suspected cases and 20 deaths have been recorded in 13 governorates, more than 80 percent in Ibb, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday. Yemen is also reeling from a cholera epidemic, with 960,065 suspected cases and 2,219 deaths reported since April, according to the latest WHO figures. ",

        "title": "Inquiry ordered into deadly Indian power plant blast",
        "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian authorities on Thursday ordered an inquiry to determine within seven days the cause of a blast at a coal-fired power plant that killed 26 people and injured more than 100   one of the country s worst industrial accidents in years. More than 20 survivors were battling for life with severe burn injuries following Wednesday s blast at the 1,550-megawatt plant operated by state-owned NTPC in northern Uttar Pradesh state, state officials said. Arvind Kumar, a principal secretary, said some of the severely injured had been taken to a hospital in the state capital Lucknow.  Blockages in the flue gas pipe in a unit led to the blast. Hot flue gases and steam let out by the blast severely injured several workers,  Sanjay Kumar Khatri, the top government official of Rae Bareli district where the plant is located, told Reuters on Thursday.  A magisterial inquiry has been initiated. This two-member technical team will submit findings within seven days,  Khatri said. NTPC is the country s top power producer and accidents have been rare at its facilities. Senior state police official Anand Kumar said in a statement posted online on Wednesday that ash had piled up in the furnace beneath the boiler, which led to building up of pressure resulting in the explosion. The state government has offered cash compensation of 200,000 rupees ($3,097) to the families of the deceased, 50,000 rupees for the severely injured and half of that to those who sustained minor injuries, Khatri said. The plant in the town of Unchahar supplies electricity to nine states, NTPC s website showed. But the company said other facilities would make up for the shortfall and outages were unlikely. The 500 MW unit, where the mishap occurred, had been operating since April and is under shut down after the accident. The other five units of the station are operating normally, NTPC said in a statement.  This is most unfortunate. NTPC has initiated an inquiry into the incident. We are not a company that will take any risk. We have so many units that if power cannot be supplied by one, it can be given by the other. It was a sudden accident,  an NTPC official, who did not wish to be quoted, said. ",

        "text": "VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen will insist that the coalition government formed after next month s parliamentary election should be pro-European, he said on Tuesday, but he stopped short of saying that ruled out the far-right. Van der Bellen, a former Greens leader, ran on a pro-European Union platform and beat an opponent from the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) in last year s presidential election. As head of state, he is mainly a figurehead but he does have the power to appoint and dismiss governments. The eurosceptic FPO initially cheered Britain s vote last year to leave the European Union but has since watered down its criticism of the bloc as polls have shown that a clear majority of Austrians want their country to remain a member.   I will ensure after the election that the new government, whatever its composition, does not lose sight of one thing: Austria should also in the future be a country at the heart of Europe, at the heart of the European Union,  Van der Bellen said in a speech to the nation ahead of the Oct. 15 vote. Van der Bellen has said he would aim to prevent FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache from becoming chancellor if the anti-immigration party won the election. That outcome appears increasingly unlikely as polls show the conservative People s Party (OVP) led by Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz has a significant lead, with Chancellor Christian Kern s Social Democrats (SPO) or the FPO in second place. The SPO and OVP have dominated post-war politics and are in coalition together, but tensions between them have grown, making it more likely the election winner will turn to the FPO to obtain a parliamentary majority and form a government. In his address, Van der Bellen called on Austrians to inform themselves on political parties and their policies and to shun short-term thinking. He also said parties should avoid clashing so fiercely that they could not hold talks after the election. When asked after his speech if he would prevent the FPO from entering government, he did not give a direct answer.  I have always said clearly, and I stand by it and I think I have also made clear today, that I place the greatest importance on Austria having a pro-European government,  he said.     ",

        "text": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela s doctors, fed up with what they called the World Health Organization s passive attitude toward the country s deep medical crisis, protested at the agency s Caracas office on Monday to demand more pressure on the government and additional assistance. Venezuela is suffering from a roughly 85 percent shortage of medicines, decrepit hospital infrastructure, and an exodus of doctors during a brutal recession. Once-controlled diseases like diphtheria and measles have returned due in part to insufficient vaccines and antibiotics, while Venezuelans suffering chronic illnesses like cancer or diabetes often have to forgo treatment. Malnutrition is also rising, doctors say. Rare government data published in May showed maternal mortality shot up 65 percent while malaria cases jumped 76 percent. The former health minister was fired shortly after the bulletin s publication, and it has not been issued since. In the latest protest by an umbrella group of health associations, dozens of doctors and activists gathered at the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the WHO s regional office, urging the agency step up pressure on Nicolas Maduro s leftist government and provide more aid during its 29th Pan American Sanitary Conference this week.  There s been a complicit attitude because they haven t denounced things,  Dr. Rafael Muci said during the rally.  This is an unlivable country, and no one is paying attention,  he said, adding he earns about $8 a month at a state hospital. In a statement on Monday, PAHO stressed its main role was to provide  technical cooperation  and highlighted recent help in providing vaccines. The Venezuelan government, which accuses activists of whipping up panic and the business elite of hiding medicines, did not respond to a request for comment. Venezuelans seeking certain drugs often have to scour pharmacies, seek foreign donations or turn to social media.  Sociologist Maria Angelica Casanova, 51, has struggled to find psychiatric medicines for a year.  Sometimes they come, sometimes they don t. It s serious,  she said, as passers-by shouted  Down with Maduro!  Measles, which were controlled after a mass immunization in the 1990s, has returned to Venezuela s jungle state of Bolivar, PAHO data show. As the crisis stokes emigration, Venezuela s health problems could be exported, doctors warned.  We don t know how many people who are emigrating could have some of these pathogens in incubation period,  said Andres Barreto, an epidemiologist who had participated in the measles vaccination drive.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign raised more than $10.1 million in the third quarter of 2017 and spent $4 million, including $1.1 million on legal fees.  Trump\u2019s campaign paid $237,924 to lawyer Alan Futerfas, who is representing Donald Trump Jr. in matters related to the campaign\u2019s involvement with Russian interference in the U.S. election.  That payment came in addition to $50,000 paid the previous quarter to the same lawyer. Futerfas has not responded to repeated requests for comment about the payment.  The campaign also paid $30,000 to Williams and Jensen, the law firm where Karina Lynch, who is also representing Trump Jr., works. Lynch did not respond to request for comment about the payment.  During the third quarter, Trump\u2019s campaign paid more than $25,000 to his own company for \u201clegal consulting,\u201d as well as $800,000 to law firm Jones Day, which provides routine legal assistance to the campaign.   Trump filed for re-election the day he took office - allowing his campaign to continue to raise and spend money while he is in office. Traditionally, presidents have waited two years to officially file for reelection, providing no historic comparisons to his level of fundraising and spending.  His campaign has raised more than $36 million since January. He has used that money to keep a small campaign staff, to fund campaign rallies and to pay legal fees associated with some of the investigations into his 2016 campaign.      Trump\u2019s campaign spent about $4 million in that same time period. In the second quarter of 2017, Trump\u2019s re-election campaign raised about $8 million and spent $4.4 million.     Of the donations, $1.2 million consisted of unitemized contributions, meaning money  from donors who gave less than $200. Trump frequently touts the level of unitemized donations as proof that voters still support his campaign. He raised about $1.9 million in unitemized contributions during the previous quarter. ",

        "text": "EVERETT, Washington/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump, who has made his criticism of a pending Pacific trade agreement central to his campaign, on Tuesday visited a Seattle suburb home to a large Boeing Co plane manufacturing facility that depends heavily on Asian sales. Trump vowed at his rally that he would win Washington state, even though the state tends to support Democrats and that party\u2019s nominee, Hillary Clinton, leads by large margins in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election. The Republican nominee, however, presents a conundrum for the unions that represent workers at Boeing, the world\u2019s largest aerospace company. He has courted manufacturing workers with vows to tear up trade agreements and scrap the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership.  \u201cThe destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday, referring to a separate deal with Canada and Mexico reached in the 1990s. He also has vowed to renegotiate that agreement. Supporters of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) point to Boeing\u2019s aircraft sales to Asia to tout the benefits of the agreement. Secretary of State John Kerry visited a nearby plant earlier this year to rally support for the pact. Manufacturing unions agree with Trump on his opposition to TPP and the export of jobs overseas, but officials said they find his track record unconvincing. \u201cThe fact is that Trump has had the opportunity to bring jobs to Americans, and he\u2019s chosen to outsource them,\u201d said Larry Brown, legislative and political director for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District Lodge 751, which represents about 32,000 workers in the state, mostly at Boeing. Boeing produces some of its largest planes only miles from where Trump spoke Tuesday night. As they are assembled, the painted tails of the planes show the airlines that ordered them, and many are Asian. Major components of each plane come from overseas: South Korea, China and Europe. Over the next 20 years, Boeing projects that Asian customers will account for 40 percent of the total global jetliner\u2019s market, the company said in a recent report. \u201cTrade is a huge part of the success of manufacturing in Washington,\u201d said Linda Dempsey, vice president of international economic affairs for the National Association of Manufacturers, which Boeing belongs to. \u201cThey are exporting $73 billion in manufactured goods.\u201d But Trump offers a more dire outlook, arguing that only he can keep Boeing from moving those high-paying manufacturing jobs from Washington to China. \u201cThey\u2019ll start taking your business away, and you won\u2019t have much of Boeing,\u201d Trump told Seattle\u2019s KIRO radio on Monday. Trump has broken with the Republican Party\u2019s traditional embrace of free trade. He has vowed to rip up the TPP and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, an existing deal with Canada and Mexico which he blames for the loss of U.S. jobs. The Republican Party\u2019s support for free trade has put it in sync with large business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. Tony Fratto, a former official in the administration of Republican George W. Bush, criticized Trump as out of step with the party. \u201cTrump\u2019s policies in this area are really dumb generally, but are particularly dumb for a major exporting company,\u201d said Fratto, who worked on behalf of a coalition of large companies, including Boeing, that were pushing for renewal of the Export-Import Bank. Some voters in Washington state remain divided. Kirk Hoeppner, 53, a business analyst at Boeing who lives in Granite Falls, Washington, said he will vote for Trump and he agrees with his business views. But he was not sure closer ties to other countries would hurt jobs there. \u201cEven if we ally with other countries, we\u2019re still going to sell more airplanes,\u201d Hoeppner said. Corey McNally, 40, of Whidbey Island, Washington, has not decided whom he will vote for. \u201cThe union members love Hillary just because they\u2019re supposed to because she\u2019s a liberal,\u201d said McNally. And Trump, whom he called \u201cjust kind of a big show,\u201d may be too late to change anything. \u201cThis company\u2019s been outsourcing jobs for years,\u201d he said of Boeing. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team is considering the use of discretionary trusts to avoid conflicts of interest for Trump family members or administration officials,  Politico reported on Wednesday.     Such an arrangement would provide individuals with an alternative to selling off assets or placing wealth in blind trusts, which president-elects traditionally do.  Trump aides have discussed the idea of discretionary trusts with the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), but it was unclear whether the set-up would be for Trump, his family or any of the wealthy individuals nominated to his Cabinet, according to Politico, which cited two unidentified sources briefed on the talks. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.   Among Trump\u2019s many holdings are hotels and golf resorts from Panama to Scotland, besides a winery and modeling agency   Federal law does not prohibit the president\u2019s involvement in private business while in office but most presidents in recent decades have placed their personal assets in blind trusts so they do not know how their decisions influence their personal fortunes. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told Politico no decisions have been made and that his team would release more details next month. Representatives for OGE declined to comment to Politico on the discussions. Discretionary trusts \u201ccould allow Trump or his family members to reap some of the legal benefits of a blind trust, but could also give them some insight into how the Trump businesses are faring while also allowing Trump and his family to continue to make money from those investments,\u201d Politico said. Trump\u2019s team has said he will address his business arrangements in January after cancelling a planned Dec. 15 news  conference on the issue, which looms over the New York businessman as he prepares to assume office on Jan. 20. Executive branch officials and U.S. lawmakers, however, are subject to conflict-of-interest rules, and Democrats in Congress have called on Trump to divest himself of his vast business interests. Trump has said he would avoid the conflict issue by transferring control of his businesses to his oldest three children, but has given no details. Critics have said the \u201chalf-blind\u201d discretionary trusts would allow Trump to sidestep conflict-of-interest rules and would be inappropriate, according to Politico. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers are considering indirect paths to meeting President Donald Trump\u2019s goal of slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, one of the toughest challenges they face in trying to overhaul the U.S. tax code. Tax writers in the House of Representatives may opt to phase in the 20 percent corporate rate over three to five years by lowering it in stages from the current 35 percent, said two sources close to the tax discussions. A phase-in surfaced as an option among Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee as it closed in on completion of actual tax legislation, working off of a nine-page \u201cframework\u201d unveiled by Trump on Sept. 27. The House was expected to be inactive on Friday and all of next week. \u201cWe\u2019ll come back in a week and be able to put together the bill that will move through committee,\u201d Republican Representative Kristi Noem\u00a0told reporters. One of the biggest problems confronting the Republican tax reform push is the federal budget deficit, which would be hugely expanded by Trump\u2019s proposals, according to independent analyses. Cutting the corporate rate immediately to 20 percent would reduce U.S. tax revenues by nearly $2 trillion over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank. Sources said House Republicans believed they could halve the projected revenue loss if the rate cut were phased in. Details of such an option were unavailable. The administration contends the cuts would pay for themselves through stronger economic growth generating new tax revenues, although most economists say that is unlikely. A different approach may emerge from the Senate, where Republicans are writing their own tax legislation. Sources with knowledge of the discussions said senators might settle on a corporate tax rate above 20 percent, but use an unorthodox \u201ccorporate integration\u201d strategy to achieve an effective rate of 20 percent or less. Corporate integration, a brainchild of Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, would help lower corporations\u2019 tax bill by giving them a deduction for shareholder dividends, analysts said. The idea has faced opposition in the past.  Both the House and Senate alternatives surfaced this week as top Republicans and Trump administration officials confronted skepticism that the Republican-controlled Congress could cut the corporate rate to 20 percent without ballooning the deficit.  Trump, who earlier in the year called for a 15 percent corporate tax rate and only reluctantly agreed to 20 percent, is now insisting that it go no higher.   \u201cThe president has made it clear. He wants 20 percent. That\u2019s the one part of this bill that\u2019s not negotiable,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters on Thursday: \u201cWe continue to drive toward the framework ... ensuring that our businesses don\u2019t have anything higher than 20 percent on the corporate side.\u201d Asked if that meant a 20 percent rate in the first year, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re moving toward that whole design.\u201d ",

        "text": "SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria should tighten rules on foreign financing for religious communities and restrict visits by foreign clerics to help counter the potential spread of radical Islam, deputy prime minister Krasimir Karakachanov said on Thursday. Karakachanov is a co-leader of the nationalist United Patriots, a junior partner in the coalition government that is known for its tough rhetoric on migration and Bulgaria s Roma. He said proposals to parliament to amend laws on religion and education as well as the criminal code would be submitted by the end of the year. Bulgaria s government banned the wearing of  full face veils in public places last year. Bulgaria has one of the biggest Muslim communities in Europe at about 12 percent of its 7.1 million population   a legacy of almost 500 years of Ottoman Turkish rule that ended in the late 19th century. Historic resistance to the Muslim Ottomans is a core element of national identity for the mainly Orthodox Christian majority and some nationalists have cast the recent arrival of Muslim migrants via Turkey as a threat to the nation s security.  It turns out that problems we see in a number of European countries already exist in Bulgaria,  Karakachanov said after a meeting to discuss how to prevent the spread of radical Islam in the country. He said  extremely liberal  laws were allowing the spread of non-traditional Islam through the private provision of education and training.  It is mostly the ... financing by private structures of religious communities that attempt to realize political influence in the country,  Karakachanov said. Many Islamist organizations in Europe are financed largely with foreign donations. Karakachanov has previously complained that many imams preaching in Bulgaria come from abroad and do not speak Bulgarian, and has spoken of fostering native imams who are more deeply integrated into Bulgarian society.  The wave of mainly Muslim refugees and migrants reaching Europe s borders over the past years has contributed to a rise in right-wing nationalism across the continent.  ",

        "title": "Trump tax cut plan gains momentum after U.S. budget vote",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\u2019s tax reform plans won partial support on Friday when Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul said he was \u201call in\u201d for massive tax cuts, but the party was still far from united over how to achieve the main item on its domestic agenda.  Trump\u2019s drive to overhaul the U.S. tax code cleared a critical hurdle on Thursday when the Senate approved a budget measure that will allow Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic party support. But Republicans, who control both the Senate and House of Representatives, have yet to produce a tax reform bill as a self-imposed deadline to overhaul the U.S. tax code by the end of the year approaches. The party\u2019s lawmakers differ widely on what cuts to make and how to pay for them.  They are under intense pressure to succeed on tax reform after failing so far to make good on their other main legislative ambition: scrapping Obamacare, the signature healthcare law of former President Barack Obama.  On major world markets, stock prices advanced on Friday, bond yields rose, and the U.S. dollar strengthened on increased hopes that Trump could make progress on his fiscal plans. Democrats are likely to reject the Trump administration\u2019s tax plan, which promises to deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts to businesses and people but will bloat the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade. Senator Rand Paul, a fiscal hawk, was the lone Republican to vote against the budget measure on Thursday. He objected to spending levels that he said would exceed agreed caps by $43 billion, and called for spending reforms for so-called entitlements such as the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs. On Friday, Paul said in a post on Twitter that he was \u201call in\u201d for the \u201cbiggest, boldest cuts possible - and soon!\u201d But he did not address the specifics of the tax plan. Trump on Friday expressed optimism about the tax reform, saying Paul would eventually back the proposed tax measure when it comes up for a vote. \u201cThe Budget passed late last night, 51 to 49. We got ZERO Democrat votes with only Rand Paul (he will vote for Tax Cuts) voting against,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis now allows for the passage of large scale Tax Cuts (and Reform), which will be the biggest in the history of our country!\u201d   Trump told Fox Business Network in a television interview set to air on Sunday that he thinks Republicans have the votes to pass a big tax cut package. He said he had been thinking about tying tax legislation to an infrastructure spending bill but that it was not clear a combined package would gain more votes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take any chances cause I feel we have the votes right now the way it is,\u201d he said, according to a transcript provided by the cable news outlet. The budget resolution passed by the Senate on Thursday has to be reconciled with a markedly different version passed by the House, where Republicans say negotiations on a unified measure could take up to two weeks. The House budget resolution calls for a revenue-neutral tax bill and would combine tax cuts with $203 billion in spending cuts to mandatory programs, including food assistance for the poor. As far as spending cuts go, the Senate version only instructs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to save at least $1 billion over the next decade.     That difference could set up a possible conflict between Republicans in the Senate and House as they negotiate a final budget blueprint.   Overhauling the complex U.S. tax code has defied Washington since 1986.     In the current effort, some Republican senators question the planned repeal of a 40 percent inheritance tax levied on estates worth more than $5.5 million, or $11 million for married couples, a tax paid only by the wealthiest American taxpayers.      Republican lawmakers from high-tax states such as New York are also seeking compromise on repealing the deduction from federal taxes for state and local tax payments. The party\u2019s lawmakers agree roughly on lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent but have not settled on a final number.     Trump seeks to cut the corporate rate to 20 percent, which he says would create jobs and boost wages for blue-collar workers.             Asked how he would make the case that the plan would not be a tax cut for the wealthy, House Speaker Paul Ryan told CBS,  \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re introducing the fourth bracket, so that high-income earners do not see a big rate cut and those resources go to the middle class ... and closing loopholes and carve outs which disproportionately benefit the very high-income people.\u201d    ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will vote on Wednesday on a measure to block the sale of tanks and other military equipment worth $1.15 billion to Saudi Arabia, but the measure is not expected to pass despite lawmakers\u2019 growing frustration with the longtime U.S. ally. The Senate\u2019s Republican Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Tuesday he would \u201caggressively\u201d oppose the effort.  \u201cI think it\u2019s important to the United States to maintain as good a relationship with Saudi Arabia as possible, and I hope we\u2019ll defeat the resolution of disapproval of the arms sale,\u201d McConnell told reporters, calling Saudi Arabia a good ally. The Pentagon announced on Aug. 9 that the State Department had approved the potential sale of more than 130 Abrams battle tanks, 20 armored recovery vehicles and other equipment to Saudi Arabia. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency said General Dynamics Corp would be the principal contractor for the sale. A bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Rand Paul and Democrat Chris Murphy, introduced a joint resolution seeking to block the arms deal, expressing concern that Saudi-led air strikes had killed civilians in Yemen, worries that the deal might fuel a regional arms race and concern that Congress was giving up its power to declare war. \u201cWe should be part of the debate over whether or not we go to war. But then we should debate the practicalities of whether or not it\u2019s a good idea to be involved in the war in Yemen,\u201d Paul told Reuters. Paul said the conflict could lead to instability and perhaps the rise of a militant group in Yemen, as Islamic State did in Syria. The resolution also underscores concerns over what many in Congress see as Riyadh\u2019s international promotion of a severe form of Islam they view as hostile to U.S. interests. \u201cWe\u2019ve let them get away with it for years and years. And because they\u2019re less bad than other people in the Middle East, we keep giving them weapons,\u201d Paul said. Democratic Representative Ted Lieu and Republican Representative Mick Mulvaney introduced companion legislation on Tuesday seeking to block the sale in the House of Representatives. Lieu in August sent a letter signed by 64 lawmakers asking U.S. President Barack Obama to postpone the sale. Separately, Congress could vote this week to override Obama\u2019s promised veto of a measure allowing relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue the Saudi government.  ",

        "title": "Debt limit showdown looms sooner as wealthy bet on Trump tax cut",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress may be headed for a reckoning with the federal debt limit within weeks, thanks to wealthy Americans and corporations deferring tax payments in the hope that they would benefit from the lower tax rates promised by President Trump. Trump promised tax cuts during his election campaign last year and has reiterated those promises in recent months leading some wealthy Americans and businesses to shift accounting for income into the future, betting that lower tax rates will arrive, perhaps in 2018, wealth managers told Reuters. \u201cEveryone wants to talk about deferring income,\u201d said Mark Copeland, senior partner at Signature Estate & Investment Advisors LLC in Newport Beach, California.  The U.S. stock market has also rallied since Trump\u2019s election victory in November, partly on hopes for lower corporate tax rates.  \u201cWe are starting to prepare clients for potentially lower taxes in 2018,\u201d said Julia Carlson, chief executive and at Financial Freedom Wealth Management Group LLC in Oregon. Trump promised to cut taxes as far back as September 2015 in a four-page plan and reiterated those promises in a two-page \u201cContract with the American Voter\u201d before last November\u2019s election and again in a one-page document in April, but Republicans in Congress remain divided on tax reform. The delay to tax payments could help to explain why tax receipts this fiscal year are coming in more slowly than projected, said tax experts and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), an arm of Congress. \u201cTaxpayers may have shifted more income than projected ... to later years, expecting legislation to reduce tax rates to be enacted this year,\u201d the CBO said in a monthly report on Wednesday. The weaker tax revenues this year have forced the U.S. Treasury to borrow more money than expected to cover the federal budget deficit and that is putting the government on track to hit its legal debt limit sooner than expected, experts said. The U.S. government has a legal limit on how much it can borrow, currently set at about $19.8 trillion and the limit can only be increased by a vote of Congress. The need to raise the debt limit usually creates partisan debate in Washington. Conservative Republicans like to use the debt limit issue as leverage to demand cuts in spending but Democrats and moderate Republicans usually oppose such ultimatums on the grounds that the borrowings are used to fund spending approved previously by Congress.   This year, with Trump\u2019s legislative agenda stalled and Congress preoccupied by Trump\u2019s firing of former FBI director James Comey, the House Republicans known as the House Freedom Caucus along with outside conservative groups are again demanding spending cuts for support to raise the debt limit. In 2011 the failure to raise the debt limit in a timely way and the possibility that the U.S. government might default on its obligations led to the U.S. losing its prized triple-A credit rating from Standard & Poor\u2019s. Since mid-March the U.S. Treasury has been using emergency funding powers to postpone hitting the debt limit and those measures had been expected to last until about October, but lower tax receipts so far this year may mean the debt limit will be hit sooner-than-expected. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged Congress last month to raise the debt ceiling before lawmakers break for a long August summer recess, a call echoed last week by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators called on President Barack Obama\u2019s administration on Friday to impose targeted sanctions on officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo responsible for violence and rights violations amid rising political tensions. Hoping to increase pressure on the government of President Joseph Kabila, three of Obama\u2019s fellow Democrats, senators Richard Durbin, Edward Markey and Christopher Murphy, said on Friday they had introduced a Senate resolution this week calling on Kabila\u2019s government to fulfill its constitutional mandate for a democratic transition of power late this year. They called for targeted sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes, until Kabila publicly commits to a peaceful transition of power. Their action reflected growing international worry over the situation in the African nation. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday voiced concern about reports of rising political tension due to uncertainty about the presidential election.  Dozens of Kabila critics have been arrested since last year as part of what the United Nations and rights groups say is an escalating crackdown on political dissent ahead of a presidential election scheduled for November. Kabila is ineligible to stand for re-election after serving two elected terms, but opponents accuse him of trying to delay the poll to hold onto power. Congo\u2019s highest court ruled last week that the president could stay in power if elections did not occur by the end of his mandate. On Thursday, a protester and a police officer were killed in Goma, in the eastern part of the country, during protests against a possible elections delay. The United Nations said dozens of people were arrested. Opposition leaders accuse Kabila of stalling the vote in order to extend his 15-year rule, which the president denies. Democratic congressional aides said they expected to add more co-sponsors for the resolution after Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess on June 6. There is bipartisan support for U.S. action to address the situation.  Republican Senator Jeff Flake, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s Africa subcommittee, told Reuters in a brief interview this week that he felt sanctions would be appropriate and had discussed them with U.S. State Department officials. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re together on this,\u201d Flake said. \u201cI think we will be.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus said on Sunday that Donald Trump is making it harder for himself to win the Republican presidential nomination by threatening to run as an independent if he is not treated fairly. In several television interviews, Priebus, who chairs the Republican National Committee, said candidates sometimes make such statements in hopes of gaining leverage over the party, but that it would not work. \u201cThose kinds of comments, I think, have consequences,\u201d Priebus said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cAnd so when you make those kinds of comments and you want people to fall in line for you, it makes it more difficult.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201c... And certainly, you know, if you were running for president of the Kiwanis Club or the Boy Scouts and you said you don\u2019t know if you like the Kiwanis or the Boy Scouts, I think that makes your challenge even greater to ultimately win those kinds of posts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no different for the Republican Party.\u201d On Tuesday, Trump backed away from the loyalty pledge he signed in September promising to support the party\u2019s eventual nominee and not to run an independent campaign for the White House. The RNC pledge has unraveled as Trump\u2019s remaining rivals, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich, also indicated they were unlikely to observe the pledge if Trump was the nominee.   Priebus said candidates signed the loyalty pledge as part of a deal in which the RNC agreed to provide data about voters. \u201cWe expect that when candidates make commitments, that they keep them,\u201d Priebus told Fox News Sunday. Trump\u2019s relationship with the RNC has been contentious at times. Talking to Fox News Sunday, he once again did not rule out running as an independent if he does not get the Republican nomination. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see how I was treated,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want to be treated fair.\u201d Priebus said that if one candidate gets the support of 1,237 delegates before the Republican convention opens in Cleveland in July, that candidate will win the party\u2019s presidential nomination. But if no one wins on the first ballot, delegates can switch their allegiances and \u201cthey can vote for who they want,\u201d Priebus told ABC. Nonetheless, Priebus told CNN, the nominee is likely to be one of the three people now running and not someone like House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, who some have speculated could be a dark-horse candidate - mainly because \u201che doesn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d Priebus also cited some practical reasons that the nominee most likely would have to be Trump, Cruz or Kasich: \u201cThat candidate would have to have a floor operation (in Cleveland) and an actual campaign going on to make that possible.\u201d ",

        "title": "U.S. Supreme Court takes up major transgender rights case",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed for the first time to rule on transgender rights in a case in which a Virginia public school district is fighting to prevent a female-born transgender high school student from using the boys\u2019 bathroom. The justices agreed to hear the Gloucester County School Board\u2019s appeal of a lower court\u2019s April 19 ruling that transgender students are protected under U.S. laws barring sex-based discrimination. The case involves a 17-year-old transgender student named Gavin Grimm, who identifies as male and sued in 2015 to win the right to use the school\u2019s boys\u2019 bathroom. The case, to be argued and decided before the end of June, will be one of the biggest of the court\u2019s term. \u201cI never thought that my restroom use would ever turn into any kind of national debate. The only thing I ever asked for was the right to be treated like everyone else,\u201d Grimm said in a statement. The court\u2019s decision to take the case means Grimm will not be able to use the boys\u2019 bathroom before graduating from high school next year, said Josh Block, his lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThese sorts of discriminatory policies stigmatize and isolate transgender students like Gavin just because of who they are,\u201d Block added. The school board\u2019s chairman, Troy Anderson, welcomed the court\u2019s decision to hear the case, saying the board\u2019s policy \u201ccarefully balances the interests of all students and parents.\u201d  Conservative groups have backed the school board, saying the fight is about student privacy rights. \u201cIn light of the right to bodily privacy, federal law should not be twisted to require that a male be given access to the girls\u2019 facilities, or a female to the boys\u2019 facilities,\u201d said Gary McCaleb, a lawyer with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group. At the heart of the case is the question of whether transgender people are covered by a ban on gender discrimination in education under federal law. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration concluded that they are, but there is a legal fight over whether judges are required to defer to the government\u2019s view. The justices could side-step a major ruling by focusing their decision on whether the administration followed the correct procedure when it gave public notice about that legal conclusion. The court remains one justice short following the February death of Antonin Scalia, which left it with four conservatives and four liberals. That raises the possibility of a 4-4 ruling that would leave in place the decision favoring Grimm by the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A 4-4 ruling would set no nationwide legal precedent. The court until now had generally steered clear of taking  potentially divisive cases while it remained shorthanded. The Supreme Court has not directly ruled on transgender rights before. But in 1994 the court did rule in favor of a male-born transgender prison inmate identifying as a woman who was held with male prisoners and said she was beaten and raped by another inmate. Whether to allow transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity rather than their birth gender has become the latest flashpoint in the long U.S. battle over lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. In a major gay rights ruling in 2015, the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The transgender fight heated up after North Carolina passed a Republican-backed law in March that required people to use bathrooms that corresponded to their gender at birth in government buildings and public schools. The North Carolina law, being challenged in court, also blocked local measures protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from discrimination.  The Obama administration in May issued nationwide guidance telling public schools that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice. That guidance infuriated many conservatives and prompted a Republican-led legal effort to fight it. Twenty-three states sued to block the guidance. A U.S. district court judge on Aug. 22 issued a nationwide injunction sought by Texas and other states preventing the administration from enforcing the guidance. In the Virginia case, the Supreme Court in July voted 5-3 to temporarily block the appeals court decision from going into effect while the litigation continued, a move that prevented Grimm from using the boys\u2019 bathroom when the new school year began in September. Grimm began attending school as a boy in September 2014. With the school\u2019s permission, Grimm used the boys\u2019 bathroom for about seven weeks without incident. But after complaints from parents, the county school board adopted a new policy in December\u00a02014 that required students to use the bathroom that corresponded with their gender at birth. Since then, Grimm has had to use a separate bathroom.  As a result of hormone therapy, Grimm has facial hair and a deep voice. Grimm has also had chest reconstruction surgery but not sex reassignment surgery. ",

        "text": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan s ruling party on Tuesday re-elected ousted premier Nawaz Sharif as its leader, saying he was  back with full force , a day after using its parliamentary majority to amend a law to allow him to re-take the job. Jafar Iqbal, who headed a five-member election body, said Sharif had been elected party president unopposed by the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz s (PML-N) central executive committee.  Sharif resigned as prime minister in July after the Supreme Court disqualified him for not declaring a source of income. He was also forced to step down as president of PML-N, though he kept control of the party and installed Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, a loyalist, as prime minister. Sharif s re-election as party chief brings him back into the  political fold, he said, contradicting those who thought he would no longer be relevant.  There have been attempts again and again to exit me, but you will always keep giving me an entry again and again,  Sharif told party workers after his election.  I congratulate that you re bringing Nawaz Sharif back with full force.    No one came forward to contest Sharif, Iqbal said amid clapping, thumping and slogans in support of Sharif in televised proceedings of the election in Islamabad. The former prime minister will lead the party for four years.    Nawaz Sharif is the symbol of economic development in Pakistan,  Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal said in his address to the party members.       Parliament amended a law on Monday to enable Sharif to re-take the PML-N leadership. Opposition lawmakers tore up paper copies of the Election Bill 2017, passed by the Senate last week, that allowed Sharif to become the party president again. The vote was more of a formality as PML-N has a vast majority. Sharif has appeared before an anti-corruption court and is expected to be indicted next week, along with three of his children.  The veteran leader denies any wrongdoing and has alleged there was a conspiracy against him, with senior PML-N figures pointing fingers at elements of Pakistan s powerful military. The army denies playing a role. ",

In Washington, Gina McCarthy, Obama\u2019s head of the Environmental Protection Agency, told state energy and environmental regulators that the ruling \u201cis not going to slow us down.\u201d The Supreme Court on Tuesday delivered a blow to the plan, the centerpiece of Obama\u2019s climate change policy and backbone of his administration\u2019s commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions pledged last year in Paris. Obama said the Supreme Court had in fact required the EPA to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act if they were shown, as scientists had, to be harmful to public health. He said some people had commented to him in recent days that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision had struck down the Clean Power Plan. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. So don\u2019t despair, people,\u201d he said. McCarthy told state regulators tasked with complying with the rule she is confident the plan will survive the legal challenges and tried to boost morale among the officials. \u201cI want you to do as I am doing,\u201d McCarthy told the crowd. \u201cPick myself up, rededicate myself and tell the people in this country that we are there to serve them,\u201d she said, while shaking her fists in the air. The Supreme Court stay was a \u201csmall pause\u201d in what has been a years-long effort of the EPA and states to get the Clean Power Plan off the ground, she said. The plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. The Supreme Court ordered a delay in implementation until legal challenges to the regulation are completed.  \u201cThis Supreme Court has said the Environmental Protection Agency is required to regulate carbon emissions if it\u2019s a threat to the public health. And we clearly can show that that\u2019s the case,\u201d Obama said. Fighting climate change is critical to the president\u2019s legacy as he completes his final year in office. ",

        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday said Germany should react decisively to Ankara s detention of two further German citizens, amid growing calls for Berlin to issue a formal travel warning for Germans heading to Turkey. Twelve German citizens are now in Turkish detention on political charges, four of them holding dual citizenship. Among these is German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, who will have been in detention 200 days on Friday. Under the circumstances, Merkel said she did not think it was appropriate to carry out further discussions with Ankara about its participation in a European Union customs union.   We must react decisively,  Merkel told a business event in the southern city of Nuremberg, noting that Germany had already fundamentally revamped its relations with Ankara.  Given the latest events, perhaps it is necessary to rethink them ever further.  Germany was not officially informed of the two new detentions, which took place at Antalya airport on Thursday, leaving Berlin s consulate in the coastal city of Izmir to learn of their arrest from  non-state sources , Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr told a news conference. Many European citizens have been detained in Turkey over the past year, accused of involvement in last year s failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom many accuse of purging opposition under the cover of a crackdown.  We re trying to establish what they are charged with,  said Adebahr said.  We must assume that it s a political charge, suspicion of terrorism, as with the others.  Diplomats had not been able to contact them, she added, with Friday s public holiday celebrating the Muslim festival of Eid a possible reason for delays in contacting officials. Social Democrat Martin Schulz, Merkel s main challenger in Sept. 24 elections, and other German politicians urged Berlin to issue a formal travel warning for Germans heading to Turkey. The government in July urged German citizens to exercise caution if traveling to Turkey, but stopped short of issuing a formal travel warning. Juergen Hardt, a senior member of Merkel s conservatives, told Die Welt newspaper that a further tightening of the travel guidance  should be seriously considered . Cem Ozdemir, leader of the Greens party, told Bild newspaper he could no longer assure anyone they would be safe in Turkey.  Erdogan is no president, but a hostage-taker,  Ozdemir told the daily newspaper Bild. No comment was immediately available from the foreign ministry about whether it was considering a travel warning. About 3 million people with Turkish heritage or citizenship live in Germany. Such a move could mark a significant setback for Turkey, which already saw the number of foreign visitors drop to its lowest level in nine years last year. Bookings from Germany accounted for some 10 percent of Turkey s tourists this year.     ",

The embassy attack, which police said caused a small fire, came in the early hours of Sunday morning against the backdrop of mounting anger in Indonesia, home to the world s biggest Muslim population, over violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. A police officer patrolling a street behind the embassy spotted a fire on the second floor of the building at about 0235 Jakarta time (GMT+7) and alerted police officers guarding the front gate, a Jakarta police statement said. After the fire was extinguished, police found a shattered beer bottle with a wick attached to it, the statement said, adding that the unknown perpetrator is suspected to have driven away from the scene in an MPV car. Jakarta police are investigating the incident, said spokesman Argo Yuwono. A group of activists had held a protest at the embassy on Saturday, calling for the Nobel Prize Committee to withdraw the Nobel Peace Prize from Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, state news agency Antara wrote. (bit.ly/2eRowl0) Protests continued on Sunday in Jakarta s city center, with dozens of people calling for the Indonesian government to take an active involvement in efforts to end human rights violations  against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. Indonesian President Widodo said he has sent Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi to Myanmar to hold  intensive communications  with involved parties including the United Nations.

The treatment of Buddhist-majority Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi, accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution.

        "text": "DAKAR/LOME (Reuters) - The leader of Togo s main opposition alliance said on Friday that President Faure Gnassingbe must quit power immediately or protests against his family s 50-year ruling dynasty would continue. Thousands of people have taken to the streets in the past three days to demand that Gnassingbe step aside, in the most serious challenge to his family s stranglehold on power since the death of his father in 2005. Police used tear gas to disperse protesters who were burning tires in Lome s opposition stronghold of Be on Friday, a Reuters correspondent said.   He has to leave now. We will not accept him staying on any longer,  Jean-Pierre Fabre, head of the National Alliance for Change, told Reuters by telephone.   The Togolese are tired ... We will continue to protest.  It was not immediately possible to reach Gnassingbe s office. Text messages and phone calls were restricted and the internet has suffered outages. A short government statement on state TV merely acknowledged the protests and said that 10 people had been injured in them, of which eight were security forces and two protesters.  But unrest was less widespread than in previous days and traffic had resumed in some areas of the seaside capital amid a heavy police and paramilitary presence. By evening there were no further reports of protests, which seemed to have died down, a Reuters witness said. The president s father Gnassingbe Eyadema seized power in a coup in 1967 and ruled for 38 years before his death.  In response to protests, he introduced a 1992 constitution that brought in notional multi-party democracy and limited presidential terms to two. Ten years later, lawmakers scrapped the term limit so Eyadema could run for another term.  When he died in 2005, the military installed his son instead of the national assembly head as was legally required, triggering protests in which at least 500 people were killed. Fabre, a French-educated former economics lecturer and newspaper editor, lost to Gnassingbe in disputed presidential polls in 2010 and 2015. He told Reuters that another election would not be fair unless major reforms were made. Gnassingbe s government this week sought to appease its opponents by tabling a draft bill to reform the constitution and reintroduce a two-term limit, but opposition leaders reject it because it could still enable Gnassingbe to rule until 2030. The president, who has encouraged investment to try to turn his tiny nation into a business, banking and shipping hub modeled on Singapore or Dubai, has a mandate due to expire in 2020. But Fabre said even that was too late for him to leave.  We can t accept that. This is a question of liberty,  he said.  The resistance is now organizing itself ... We are very numerous.  The U.N. Special Representative for West Africa and the Sahel Mohamed Ibn Chambas urged Togo to respond to people s  legitimate expectations . He also called on all parties  to preserve peace and security . Chambas, who met with Gnassingbe on Thursday, has delayed his departure and is staying in Togo for further discussions, his spokesman said.   I remain convinced that all parties want to move forward on the reforms ... in order to reach a consensus to respond to the legitimate expectations of the Togolese people,  Chambas said in a statement. Since Gambian autocrat Yahya Jammeh was forced out after losing an election last December, West African countries have become unanimous in accepting two terms as the limit on presidential office   the only exception being Togo. Security forces appear to have avoided bloodshed so far this week, but Amnesty International condemned security forces for firing tear gas at and beating peaceful protesters, and for an  unjustified attack on internet freedom.

        "title": "Bullets and burns: Portraits of injured Rohingya refugees",
        "text": "COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - The two Rohingya Muslim brothers, six-year-old Mohamed Heron and four-year-old Akhter, held each other as they showed burns on their arms and torsos that their uncle says resulted from Myanmar s armed forces firing rockets at their village. Two of their siblings, one seven years old and the other a 10-month-old infant, died in the attack, according to their uncle, Mohamed Inus. Their father was held by the military and has not been heard of since.   These two children survived when our village was fired on with rockets,  Inus told Reuters at Kutupalong refugee camp, near Cox s Bazar in Bangladesh. They were among a number of Rohingya who showed their wounds to a Reuters photographer who visited Kutupalong and the nearby camps at Balukhali, Leda and Nayapara. (Click reut.rs/2hBZZoK to view the photo essay) Fleeing along with other villagers who abandoned their scorched homes, the boys reached Bangladesh after a three-day trek. At Kutupalong, they were treated for three weeks for their burns at a M decins Sans Fronti res (MSF) clinic. Since the ethnic violence erupted in late August, thousands of Rohingya have crossed the border each week, often travelling for days and even weeks, trekking through forests and over mountains, with many making a hazardous river or sea crossing on the last leg of their flight to fellow-Muslim Bangladesh. Bangladeshi hospitals and international aid agencies are struggling to provide medical care for all the refugees, many of whom have suffered horrific injuries and psychological trauma. Since the crisis began, Chittagong Medical College Hospital has received 261 casualties suffering wounds from gunshots or explosions, according to its director, Brigadier General Jalal Uddin.  Sixteen have died from their wounds and some have been crippled.  We have had to amputate the limbs of some patients,  Jalal Uddin said. Sadar Hospital in Cox s Bazar had treated 1,467 Rohingya since the exodus began for injuries including bullet wounds, broken bones, and cuts inflicted by knives or machetes, residential medical officer Shaheen Abdur Rahman Chowdhury said.  More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since Myanmar s military launched what it described as  clearance operations  following a series of attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts in Rakhine state in late August. Rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population. The U.N. rights agency said it was  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing . Myanmar, an overwhelmingly Buddhist nation, rejects the charge, saying its forces targeted insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, whom it has accused of setting fires and attacking civilians.   At the camps in Bangladesh, other Rohingya victims of the violence recounted the horrors they had lived through.   Anwara Begum, 36, said she woke to find her home in Maungdaw township, in the northernmost part of Rakhine state, in flames. Before she could get out the burning roof caved in on her and her nylon clothes melted onto her arms. Her husband carried her for eight days to reach the Kutupalong camp in Bangladesh.   I thought I was going to die. I tried to stay alive for my children,  she said, adding she was still waiting for treatment for her burns.  His right arm swathed in bandages from the knuckles of his hand to well above the elbow, Imam Hossain, 42, lay exhausted on the roadside near the Kutupalong camp. He was returning home after teaching at a madrassa in his village when three men attacked him with knives.   The next day, he made his wife and two children leave with other villagers fleeing to Bangladesh. He reached Cox s Bazar later. He was still searching for his family.  I want to ask the Myanmar government why they are harming the Rohingya,  he said.  Why do Buddhists hate us? Why do you torture us? What is wrong with us?   Suffering burns to his limbs and torso, Mohamed Jabair, 21, had feared that he had also lost his sight in an explosion that ripped through his village home.    Knocked unconscious and badly burned, Jabair was carried by his brother and others for four days to Cox s Bazar.    I was blind for many weeks and admitted to a government hospital in Cox s Bazar for 23 days. I was frightened that I would be blind forever,  he said.   Jabair said money sent by relatives in Malaysia had run out and he could no longer afford treatment.    Bowing to show deep cuts arcing across his scalp, 17-year-old Nur Kamal described how soldiers assaulted him after they found the young shopkeeper hiding in his home in Kan Hpu village in Maungdaw.    They hit me with a rifle butt on my head first and then with a knife,  Kamal said.    His uncle found him unconscious in a pool of blood. It took them two weeks to get to Bangladesh.    We want justice,  Kamal said.  We want the international community to help us obtain justice.     Her husband, daughter and one son were killed when soldiers fired on Kalabarow s village in Maungdaw. The 50-year-old woman was hit in her right foot. For several hours, she lay where she fell, pretending to be dead, before a grandson found her. During their 11-day journey to Bangladesh, a village doctor amputated her infected foot and four men carried her on a stretcher made of bamboo and a bedsheet.   As we walked through the forest, we saw burnt villages and dead bodies. I thought we would never be safe,  she said.   Abdur Rahaman, a 73-year-old merchant from Maungdaw, was ambushed while walking on a mountain path with other refugees.  A machete thrown at his feet severed three toes as he ran from his attackers. With his foot bleeding through a tourniquet made from his longyi, or sarong, Rahaman walked for two more hours, before his nephew and friends carried him across the border.  Our future is not good,  he said.  Allah must help us. The international community has to do something.    Curled up in a ball, 11-year-old Ansar Allah shows a large, livid scar on his right thigh - the result of a gunshot wound.   They sprayed us with bullets, as our house was burning,  his mother Samara said.  It was a bullet half the size of my index finger,  she said, before adding,  I can t stop thinking, why did God put us in that dangerous situation?    Setara Begum, 12, was among nine siblings in their home in Maungdaw when it was hit by a rocket.    I saved eight of my nine children from the burning house, but Setara was trapped inside,  said her mother, Arafa.    I could see her crying in the middle of the fire, but it was difficult to save her. By the time we could reach her, she was badly burned,  Arafa said.   Setara s father carried her for two days to Bangladesh.    The young girl received no treatment for the severe burns to her feet. Her feet healed. But she has no toes. The trauma has scarred her psychologically.    She has been mute from that day, and doesn t speak to anyone,  her mother said.  She only cries silently.  Her face heavily bandaged, Momtaz Begum told how soldiers came to her village demanding valuables.    I told them I was poor and had nothing. One of them started beating me saying,  If you have no money, then we will kill you .    After beating her, they locked her in her home and set fire to the roof. She escaped to find her three sons dead and her daughter beaten and bleeding.   Momtaz fled to Bangladesh, where she spent 20 days at the MSF clinic being treated for burns to her face and body.    What can I say about the future, if now we have no food, no house, no family. We cannot think about the future. They have killed that as well.  ",

        "title": "U.S. expels 15 Cuban diplomats, fuelling tensions with Havana",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday expelled 15 Cuban diplomats to protest Cuba s failure to protect staff at the U.S. embassy in Havana from a mysterious spate of health  attacks,  spurring new tensions between the former Cold War foes. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the expulsions from Cuba s embassy in Washington were also intended to ensure  equity  in staffing levels, after he recalled more than half the U.S. diplomatic personnel in Havana on Friday. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez denounced the decision as  unjustified,  accused the United States of insufficient cooperation with Cuba s investigation of the health incidents and urged Washington to stop politicizing the matter. The steps taken by Republican President Donald Trump s administration delivers another blow to his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama s policy of rapprochement, including actions likely to erode the normalization of a relationship dominated for decades by mutual hostility and suspicion. The latest U.S. move was communicated to Cuban Ambassador Jose Ramon Cabanas on Tuesday, and the diplomats were given seven days to leave, a State Department official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Until the Government of Cuba can ensure the safety of our diplomats in Cuba, our embassy will be reduced to emergency personnel to minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm,  Tillerson said in a statement.  We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, and will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks,  he added. The United States announced on Friday that it was sharply reducing its diplomatic presence in Cuba, as it warned U.S. citizens not to visit the Communist-ruled island because of the alleged attacks it says have caused hearing loss, dizziness and fatigue in 22 U.S. embassy personnel. The State Department had said the embassy was halting regular visa operations for Cubans seeking to visit the United States and would offer only emergency services to U.S. citizens. Cuba has denied involvement in any attacks and says it has reinforced security for U.S. diplomatic personnel. Rodriguez said lack of U.S. cooperation had stymied its own investigation into the matter. Authorities had not provided access to the injured people and the doctors who examined them, or to the homes where the attacks allegedly took place, he said, adding that evidence had been delivered late.  Rodriguez urged the United States to cooperate more and said Cuba was also working with Canada on the investigation as Canadian diplomats have reported similar symptoms. So far, none of the probes have yielded any answers about how the alleged attacks were carried out or who was responsible. Several Cuban-American Republican lawmakers, including U.S Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, had urged that Cuban diplomats be kicked out in retaliation for the Cuban government s failure to get to the bottom of the attacks.  I commend the U.S. State Department for expelling a number of Cuban operatives from the U.S.,  Rubio, an influential voice on Trump s Cuba policy, said in a statement. But James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a Washington-based pro-engagement lobbying group said:  This decision appears to be purely political, driven by the desire of a handful of individuals in Congress to halt progress between our two countries.   It looks like we are returning the threats and tensions of the 1960s,  said Maria Fernandez, a 45-year-old office worker in Havana.  This is madness by Trump. It s really sad, because we are so close, and yet so far away from a sincere rapprochement.  Trump, who in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by his Democratic predecessor Obama after five decades of hostility, called the Cuban government  corrupt and destabilizing  in his address to the United Nations last month. Cuba described his comments as  unacceptable and meddling.  Rodriguez urged the United States  not to continue politicizing this matter, which can provoke an undesirable escalation and could rarify and reverse even more bilateral relations.  In Havana, U.S. diplomats frantically selling off their belongings at garage sales and on social media, said they were disappointed to be ordered to leave. In a message on Facebook, the embassy s top official, career diplomat Scott Hamilton, said he would also be leaving.  I am an optimist and hope we will return one day, before too long,  he wrote.  Hasta la proxima Cuba.  ",

        "title": "Saudi university to dismiss suspected Brotherhood-linked academics",
        "text": "RIYADH (Reuters) - A large Saudi public university announced it would dismiss employees suspected of ties to the banned Muslim Brotherhood, adding to concerns that the government is clamping down on its critics in academia and beyond. Activists and rights groups say security forces have rounded up some 30 clerics, intellectuals and others in the past 10 days, in what Human Rights Watch has described as  a coordinated crackdown on dissent . Authorities have not explicitly acknowledged the detentions, which come amid widespread speculation - denied by officials - that King Salman will abdicate in favor of his son as well as deepening tensions with neighboring Qatar, which is accused by Riyadh of supporting Islamists, including the Brotherhood. The governing council of Al-Imam Mohammed Ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh advised against renewing contracts for employees it said were  influenced by the ideology of the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood organization . The statement, posted online on Tuesday, did not name the employees or specify their number, but said they included Saudis and foreigners. The employees  removal  aims to protect the minds of students and university employees from those deviant, partisan ideas and dangerous, destructive trends , it added. Saudi Arabia designated the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization in 2014. Hardline groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State are also blacklisted. The ruling Al Saud family has always regarded Islamist groups as a major internal threat to its rule over a country in which appeals to religious sentiment resonate deeply and an al Qaeda campaign a decade ago killed hundreds. Since the kingdom s founding, the Al Saud have enjoyed a close alliance with clerics of the ultra-conservative Wahhabi school of Islam who have espoused a political philosophy that demands obedience to the ruler. By contrast the Brotherhood advances an active political doctrine urging revolutionary action, which flies in the face of Wahhabi teaching.  A political Islamist organization founded in Egypt nearly a century ago, it says it is committed to peaceful activism and reform through elections, and its adherents span the region, holding elected office in Arab countries from Tunisia to Jordan. Brotherhood members fleeing repression in Egypt, Syria and Iraq half a century ago took shelter in Saudi Arabia, some taking up roles in the kingdom s education system and helping to establish the Sahwa or  Awakening  movement which agitated in the 1990s for democracy. The Sahwa mostly fizzled, with some activists arrested and others coaxed into conformity, though admirers and its appeal lingered. ",

        "title": "Despite showman reputation, Trump inauguration shaping up as low-key",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump made his name with opulent hotels and a dramatic reality TV show, but his inauguration on Friday as the 45th U.S. president is shaping up as a more understated affair, with big names in entertainment staying away. Like those who came before him, Trump will take his oath on the steps of the U.S. Capitol building and lead a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue, but there will be fewer official balls and  less glitz and celebrity talent to welcome in the new president. Inaugurations have been star-studded affairs since 1941, when President Franklin Roosevelt held a gala with actors Charlie Chaplin, Mickey Rooney and other stars of the era, said Jim Bendat, a historian who has written a book on U.S. inaugurations. But this year, several singers \u2013 including Elton John and Charlotte Church \u2013 declined invitations to perform at inaugural events. Trump, a New York businessman and former star of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d TV show, won with a populist platform that included promises to build a wall along the Mexican border, restrict immigration from Muslim countries and dismantle Obamacare. Broadway star Jennifer Holliday said yes to performing, but backed down after a backlash from fans.  \u201cYou can\u2019t really find precedent for that,\u201d Bendat said in an interview. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, singer Jackie Evancho and the Rockettes dancing troupe are among those slated to perform, although individual Rockettes will be allowed to opt out of performing if they so choose. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee has said it is intentionally avoiding top entertainers. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate in that we have the greatest celebrity in the world, which is the president-elect,\u201d Tom Barrack, inaugural committee chairman, told reporters at Trump Tower in New York last week. \u201cSo what we\u2019ve done, instead of trying to surround him with what people consider A-listers, is we are going to surround him with the soft sensuality of the place,\u201d Barrack said. Trump is slated to attend three official galas. Other modern inaugurations have had around 10 official balls, which the president and first lady would attend in rapid succession, typically dancing during each appearance.  Then-President Bill Clinton held a record 14 balls during his 1997 inauguration, Bendat said.  On Thursday, a series of choirs and marching bands will perform at the Lincoln Memorial, followed by a concert featuring country music star Toby Keith.  Trump, who is entering office with unusually low approval ratings, has repeatedly pushed back against reports that his inauguration may be lacking in star power or have low attendance. \u201cPeople are pouring into Washington in record numbers,\u201d Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday. \u201cBikers for Trump are on their way. It will be a great Thursday, Friday and Saturday!\u201d  Officials expect about 800,000 spectators for the events \u2013 down from the estimated 1.8 million who flocked to Washington for Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration. Just 40 percent of Americans said they had a favorable view of Trump versus 55 percent who had an unfavorable view, according to a Gallup poll taken from Jan. 4 to Jan. 8.  At a similar point before he took office in 2009, Obama was viewed favorably by 78 percent of Americans. Before taking office in 2001, President George W. Bush had a 62 percent favorable rating, according to the Gallup data. \u201cWhat is most likely to distinguish Trump\u2019s inauguration is the number of protesters,\u201d said Brian Balogh, co-host of American history radio show BackStory. The National Parks Service has granted permits to protest for 27 groups. On Saturday, the National Mall will draw what organizers estimate will be about 200,000 people to a Women\u2019s March to protest Trump. The Women\u2019s March, which is expected to be the largest protest, is aimed at bringing attention to human and civil rights issues. Honorary co-chairs of the protest include activist Gloria Steinem and actor Harry Belafonte.  ",

        "title": "Exodus of Rohingya to Bangladesh reaches 270,000 - UNHCR",
        "text": "COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - An estimated 270,000 Rohingya have sought refuge in Bangladesh over the past two weeks, the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday, announcing a dramatic jump in numbers fleeing violence in neighboring Myanmar s Rakhine State. A rights group said satellite images showed about 450 buildings had been burned down in a Myanmar border town largely inhabited by Rohingya, as part of what the Muslim minority refugees say is a concerted effort to expel them. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said the estimated number of Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh since violence erupted in Myanmar on Aug. 25 had risen from 164,000 on Thursday, after  aid workers found big groups in border areas.  We have identified more people in different areas that we were not aware of,  said Vivian Tan, a spokeswoman for UNHCR, while adding that there could be some double-counting.  The numbers are so alarming - it really means that we have to step up our response and that the situation in Myanmar has to be addressed urgently.  The latest flight of Rohingya began two weeks ago after Rohingya insurgents attacked security force posts in Myanmar s Rakhine State. That triggered an army counteroffensive in which at least 400 people died.  The United States, a principle backer of Aung San Suu Kyi s civilian government that came to power in Myanmar last year, said there had been shortcomings on the part of Myanmar security forces and the government in dealing with the situation. Patrick Murphy, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said Washington was calling in talks with Myanmar s military and civilian leaders for urgent restoration of access to Rakhine State for humanitarian assistance and journalists. He said the security forces must respond responsibly to the attacks that began the crisis, telling reporters:  They have a responsibility to carry out those activities in accordance with rule of law and international human rights  Rights groups briefed U.N. Security Council diplomats on the Myanmar violence on Friday. Russia and China did not send any diplomats, according to people at the meeting. Myanmar has said it is was counting on China and Russia to protect it from any Security Council censure.  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke with Suu Kyi by phone on Wednesday and reiterated his concerns about the situation in Rakhine State, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told Reuters. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the United States was  deeply troubled by continued reports of attacks against innocent civilians and will continue to urge (Myanmar) security forces to respect those civilians as it conducts security operations.  Washington was also calling on Myanmar to ensure that aid reached those in need as quickly as possible,  and that it is delivered in a manner that protects their rights and dignity,  she said in a statement. The wave of refugees, many sick or wounded, has strained the resources of aid agencies and communities already helping hundreds of thousands displaced by previous waves of violence in Myanmar. Many have no shelter, and aid agencies are racing to provide clean water, sanitation and food.  We need to prepare for many more to come, I am afraid,  said Shinni Kubo, Bangladesh country manager for UNHCR.  We need huge financial resources. This is unprecedented. This is dramatic. It will continue for weeks and weeks.  While most refugees are coming on foot, many are braving the sea. At least 300 boats carrying Rohingya arrived in Bangladesh s Cox s Bazar district on Wednesday, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said. Buddhist-majority Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists  it blames for the attacks on the security forces, burning homes and civilian deaths.  It says about 30,000 non-Muslims have been displaced. The 1.1 million Rohingya living in Myanmar have long complained of persecution. They are denied citizenship and regarded as illegal migrants from Bangladesh. There is very limited access to the north of Rakhine State and few if any independent witnesses, raising fears that a humanitarian crisis could be unfolding among Rohingya still there.  What we know is what people are saying as they come across, and what they re saying now, given this been going on since Aug. 25, is they are in an absolutely desperate state,  said IOM s Leonard Doyle.  They say (they are) living out in (the) open, without protection from the tropical sun with their children, without enough food to eat.   Bangladesh has proposed  safe zones  run by aid groups for Rohingya in Myanmar. But it would seem the plan is unlikely to be accepted there. Human Rights Watch said satellite images taken last Saturday showed hundreds of burned buildings in Maungdaw, a district capital in Rakhine State, in areas primarily inhabited by Rohingya.  If safety cannot even be found in area capitals, then no place may be safe,  said Phil Robertson, the group s deputy Asia director. A Myanmar reporter in the north of the state said he had reports from residents of an area called Rathedaung that six villages there had been torched and that there had also been shooting in the area. It was not clear who was responsible. Critics have accused Suu Kyi of not speaking out for the Rohingya and some have called for the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991 as a champion of democracy to be revoked. The United States has been careful to avoid direct criticism of Suu Kyi, and Murphy said Washington was looking to help Myanmar s transition to democracy succeed.  He noted that most authority in Rakhine State lay with the military, which wielded direct power in Myanmar for decades before Suu Kyi s election win. Murphy called for implementation of recommendations of a commission led by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan set up to find solutions for the ethnically and religiously divided Rakhine.  The fact that over a million people inside the country have been devoid of basic rights for generations has been a long-standing issue,  Murphy said.  It needs to be addressed.  Protests against the treatment of the Rohingya were held in several countries, including Muslim-majority Bangladesh,  Indonesia and Malaysia. Others were held outside Myanmar s embassies in Tokyo and Manila. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said he was considering raising the issue in talks with U.S. President Donald Trump next week. Malaysia s coastguard said it was willing to offer Rohingya  temporary shelter, although it is unlikely refugees would travel hundreds of kilometres south by sea during the monsoon season, which lasts until late November. Thailand has also said it is preparing to receive people fleeing Myanmar, while Singapore said it was ready to help the humanitarian effort. ",

Trump said shortly before arriving in Beijing he would discuss as a  top priority  stopping the  flood of cheap and deadly  fentanyl  manufactured in China  when he meets Xi.  Every year drug trafficking destroys millions and millions of lives,  Trump said in Beijing, standing next to Xi at the end of formal talks between the two.  Today President Xi and I discussed ways we can enhance coordination to better counter the deadly drug trade and to stop the lethal flow of poisonous drugs into our countries and into our communities,  he added.  A special emphasis will be placed on the new phenomenon - fentanyl - destroying lives by the millions. We re going to be focusing on it very strongly, the president and myself,  Trump said, without elaborating. Speaking later to reporters, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump and Xi agreed to take new steps.  On the critical issue of opioids, we made some good progress to curb the flow of harmful narcotics into the United States in order to save American lives,  Tillerson said.   The president committed to taking new actions including agreements to control the export and movement of fentanyl precursors, sharing intelligence on drug trafficking, and exchanging trafficking information,  he added, referring to Xi. China s drug control agency last week disputed Trump s claim that most of the synthetic drug fentanyl at the heart of the U.S. opioid crisis was produced in China. Opioids include prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic drug 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. The Centers for Disease Control estimated that 20,000 Americans were killed by fentanyl last year, surpassing common painkillers and heroin for the first time. American law enforcement agencies and drug control experts say most of the fentanyl distributed in the United States, as well as precursor chemicals, originate from China. While Chinese officials dispute these claims, Beijing has taken steps to crack down on the production and export of synthetic drugs, and has placed fentanyl and 22 other related compounds on its list of controlled substances.

        "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said it will release a South Korean fishing vessel on Friday for humanitarian reasons after the boat was found  illegally  in waters under the North s control six days ago, North Korean state news agency KCNA said. The boat and its crew had been captured on Oct. 21 and they will be released  at the designated waters of the military boundary line in the East Sea (38 39 20  latitude, 128 38 10 longitude) at 1800 on Oct. 27,  the news agency report said.  North Korea had reached its decision to release the South Korean boat after  taking into account the fact that all the crewmen honestly admitted their offence, repeatedly apologizing and asking for leniency,  the report said in English. An investigation by the North had  proved  the boat and crew had entered North Korean waters for fishing. North Korean fishing boats, because of age or low fuel, have been found drifting south of the maritime border between the two Koreas at times. Most North Korean crew are released to the North after interrogations by intelligence officials if they wish to return. It is more unusual for South Korean fishing vessels to be found under similar circumstances. The South Korean government could not be immediately reached for comment. ",

        "title": "Trump accuser follows Cosby playbook by pursuing defamation suit",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - When former reality television contestant Summer Zervos accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct last fall, she pursued her claims solely in the court of public opinion, since the allegations dated too far back to allow a lawsuit. But last month, she found a fresh approach to fight the former host of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d who has vehemently denied her allegations that he groped her in 2007. By professing his innocence, the man who is now president of the United States had effectively called her a liar, Servos alleges in a defamation lawsuit. The suit copied a rare legal tactic employed most notably by several women who have accused the actor and comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault: using his denials as the basis for a defamation claim. It is not uncommon for high-profile allegations against celebrities to prompt defamation lawsuits, but they are usually filed by the star against the accuser. In 2014, however, Joseph Cammarata, the attorney for Cosby accuser Tamara Green, realized he could adapt that strategy for his own purposes after Cosby\u2019s lawyer issued a statement calling the allegations \u201cfantastical.\u201d Like many other Cosby accusers, Green was unable to sue for assault because the alleged incident occurred decades ago. \u201cA direct claim for the assault is not available, so I came up with the idea that a defamation claim would be the appropriate vehicle to use to address the underlying harm,\u201d said Cammarata, whose lawsuit now includes seven Cosby accusers as plaintiffs. All told, 10 Cosby accusers filed four defamation lawsuits in three states. In simple terms, the argument is that Trump and Cosby have effectively branded the women as liars by denying the incidents occurred. But the women face a difficult challenge in making their cases, experts say. \u201cMerely saying, \u2018I didn\u2019t do it,\u2019 is traditionally not seen in defamation law as calling your accuser a liar, even though logically that\u2019s what it means,\u201d said Rod Smolla, dean of the Delaware Law School and a First Amendment scholar.  \u201cBut if you go beyond that \u2013 if you go from, \u2018I didn\u2019t do it,\u2019 to, \u2018She\u2019s a liar,\u2019 now you have arguably made a statement of fact\u201d that could be subject to liability, he added. Trump\u2019s status as president does not shield him from civil liability for actions he took prior to assuming office. In a statement on Tuesday, the attorney defending Trump in the Zervos lawsuit, Marc Kasowitz, said he and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer would soon file a response to the lawsuit. \u201cPresident Trump continues to deny any allegation of wrongdoing raised in said complaint,\u201d he said. Cosby, 79, who faces allegations of sexual misconduct from approximately 50 women, has also denied any wrongdoing. The Cosby and Trump plaintiffs are taking on a tough double burden, experts said. First, the only way to show the denials by both men are untrue is to prove the incidents took place as described. \u201cThe burden is going to be on her to show that Trump is actually saying something that\u2019s false,\u201d Clay Calvert, a First Amendment expert at the University of Florida, said of Zervos. In addition, the women must show Trump and Crosby crossed the line into defamation by deliberately making false statements that seriously harmed the accusers\u2019 reputations. In defamation cases, courts typically examine statements to determine whether they were factual or opinion, as expressing an opinion is generally protected by the First Amendment. Making that distinction can be challenging. In the Cosby cases, for instance, judges have split on whether the lawsuits should proceed, even coming to opposite conclusions regarding the same statement from his attorney. U.S. District Judge Mark Mastroianni in Massachusetts rejected Cosby\u2019s attempts to have two cases, including Green\u2019s lawsuit, thrown out. In his rulings, the judge found that a November 2014 statement from Cosby\u2019s lawyer calling the allegations \u201cunsubstantiated, fantastical stories\u201d could be reasonably seen as factual, and therefore potentially defamatory. By contrast, a Pittsburgh federal judge, Arthur Schwab, tossed a similar case against Cosby, finding that the same statement was \u201cpure opinion\u201d and thus protected. Unlike Cosby, who has been fairly circumspect in his public statements, Trump has aggressively attacked his accusers, calling the claims \u201c100 percent fabricated and made-up.\u201d His rhetoric could make him more vulnerable to a defamation claim, experts said. Trump has said he never met Zervos at a hotel, despite her allegation that he groped her at a hotel in Beverly Hills, California. That type of specific fact-based assertion can also make it easier to show defamation if it can be proven false, according to Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California in Los Angeles. \u201cSo much depends on the particular statement and the particular context surrounding that statement,\u201d he said.

        "title": "Undocumented immigrants given roles at Democratic convention",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Democratic Party has selected a handful of undocumented immigrants for official roles at next week\u2019s Democratic National Convention, in a bid to highlight the gaping policy divide on immigration between White House hopeful Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump. Clinton is hoping to drive Latino voters to the polls on Nov. 8 to shore up her chances against Trump, who has campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration by building a wall along the Mexican border and deporting millions of undocumented foreigners if elected. \u201cOur nation is a nation of immigrants that believes in being inclusive, and that\u2019s exactly what we will continue to work toward,\u201d said\u00a0Leah Daughtry, the chief executive officer of the committee organizing the July 25-28 convention in Philadelphia. \u201cThe voices of our nation\u2019s brave undocumented youth will be heard loud and clear,\u201d Daughtry added. The picks include two members of the convention credentials and platform committees, as well as several speakers. The positions are unpaid, officials said. Trump\u2019s campaign, which has argued that unchecked immigration hurts American workers and undermines national security, criticized the move. \u201cApparently speaking at Hillary Clinton\u2019s convention is just one more job Hillary Clinton thinks Americans won\u2019t do,\u201d a Trump campaign aide said in an emailed statement. \u201cShe should have instead invited unemployed Americans, or victims of crime, or law enforcement.\u201d  The selections are legal because of a \u201cdeferred action program\u201d adopted by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, which postpones deportations and provides work authorization for some immigrants brought to the United States as children. The Supreme Court blocked efforts to expand those protections last month. The nominations mark the first time a major U.S. political party\u2019s convention has featured so many undocumented workers among its ranks. While there was an undocumented speaker at the 2012 Democratic convention, the party has not previously tracked the immigration status of its committee members. \u201cIt changes the whole conversation when you have someone directly affected at the table,\u201d said Cesar Vargas, a Mexican immigrant chosen for the party\u2019s policy platform committee.  Hareth Andrade, 23, an undocumented immigrant from Bolivia who was approved under a deferred action program, was picked for the credentials committee.\u00a0The convention will also feature at least two undocumented immigrant speakers, Astrid Silva and Francisca Ortiz. Clinton already has overwhelming support from minorities. Some 70 percent back her, compared with 9 percent for Trump, according to recent Reuters/Ipsos polling, suggesting that she could have a strong chance in states like Florida, Nevada and Colorado that swing between voting Democratic and Republican in presidential elections.  However, voter turnout among Latinos has traditionally been low, hitting only about 40 percent in 2012, meaning her challenge is to get more of them to cast ballots this year. Luis Fraga, co-director of the Institute for Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame, said showing a commitment to progressive reform of U.S. immigration policy could help Clinton do that.  He called immigration a gateway issue for minority voters that can help engage them. That\u2019s especially so because even Latinos born in the United States are often not far removed from family members who are immigrants themselves.  \u201cAlthough it\u2019s not their individual experience, it is their family\u2019s experience,\u201d Fraga said.

        "title": "Factbox: Dakota Access Pipeline's long journey",
        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday allowing the Dakota Access Pipeline to go forward, after months of protests from Native American groups and climate activists pushed the Obama administration to ask for additional environmental review for the controversial project.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in December turned down the request for an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline to build under the Missouri River. Most of the pipeline has been constructed already, with the short stretch under the Missouri River remaining unbuilt. The following is a timeline of the project: December 2014 Energy Transfer Partners LP applies to the North Dakota Public Service Commission to build a 1,172-mile (1,885 km), 570,000-barrel-per-day pipeline to deliver crude oil from North Dakota\u2019s Bakken shale fields to Patoka, Illinois, crossing South Dakota and Iowa, kicking off a year of public hearings in North Dakota. January  North Dakota regulators approve the pipeline unanimously. April 29 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers holds a hearing for Native Americans on the pipeline.  July 25 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approves three easements for water crossings for the pipeline at Sakakawea, the Mississippi River and Lake Oahe, which is an ancestral site for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.  July 27 The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sues the Army Corps of Engineers in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, citing violation of multiple federal statutes that authorize the pipeline\u2019s construction and operation, and seeks an emergency order to halt construction. The tribe also alleges the pipeline threatens their environmental and economic well-being and would damage and destroy sites of historic, religious and cultural significance. The Sioux Tribe say because the pipeline goes underneath Lake Oahe, approximately half a mile upstream of the tribe\u2019s reservation, leaks from the pipeline would be directly in the tribe\u2019s ancestral lands. Sept. 3 Private security guards hired by Energy Transfer Partners use attack dogs and mace after violence erupted at a private construction site along the pipeline route. Six people are reportedly bitten by dogs, a scene captured on video and broadcast widely. Sept. 6 Brian Cladoosby, president of the National Congress of American Indians, which represents more than 500 tribes, speaks to nearly a dozen of President Barack Obama\u2019s Cabinet-level advisers at a Sept. 6 meeting of the White House\u2019s three-year-old Native American Affairs Council. Cladoosby delivers an impassioned request: Stand with Native Americans who have united with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and block construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.  Sept. 9 U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington rejects a broad request from Native Americans to block the project. But herules that no construction activity on the Dakota Access may take place between Highway 1806 and 20 miles to the east of Lake Oahe. Construction activity to the west of Highway 1806 may proceed. The tribe appeals the decision. Sept. 9 Less than an hour after Boasberg\u2019s decision, the U.S. Justice and Interior Departments and Army makes an unprecedented move and orders a stop to construction near Lake Oahe until the Army Corps of Engineers reviews its previous decisions and decides if it needs to conduct a fuller environmental and cultural review. Sept. 13 Energy Transfer Partners tells employees in a letter, provided to media, that it is committed to completing the project, citing that the pipeline is 60 percent complete and that it has already spent $1.6 billion so far on equipment, materials and the workforce. Oct. 9 The U.S. Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit says an administrative injunction related to the emergency motion of the Standing Rock Tribe would be dissolved, citing that Dakota Access has rights to construct on private land up to Lake Oahe. Oct. 11 Environmental activists across four states disrupt the flow of millions of barrels of crude from Canada into the United States in a rare, coordinate action that targets several key pipelines simultaneously. The protest group, the Climate Direct Action, say their move is in support of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. As a safety precaution, companies operating the pipelines shut off sections of the lines for several hours while they investigate.  Oct. 25 Government-to-government tribal consultations begin across six regions on how federal government decision-making on infrastructure projects could better include tribal concerns. Nov. 8 Energy Transfer Partners says it has built the pipe to the edge of Lake Oahe and reiterates its intentions to complete the project. Nov. 9 Following the surprise victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election, climate activists and the Standing Rock Sioux say they still hope President Obama will be able to kill the pipeline definitively. Analysts say the line is more than likely to go through. Nov. 14 The U.S. government, in a joint notice issued by the Department of the Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers, delays a final decision on permitting. They say the permit had followed all legal requirements, but more consultation with Native American tribes is needed. Nov. 18 Energy Transfer Partners\u2019 CEO Kelcy Warren tells the Associated Press that the pipeline would not be re-routed.  Nov. 20 About 400 activists gather on a bridge between the camp protest and the construction path; law enforcement officers respond by using tear gas and water cannons on them in freezing temperatures.  Nov. 26 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers tells protesters they need to leave the Oceti Sakowin Camp, the primary protest camp located on federal land, by Dec. 5. They later say they have no plans to enforce this order. Nov. 28  North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple issues an evacuation order for the Oceti Sakowin camp, citing harsh weather on the way. Officials the next day tell Reuters they plan on blockading the camp so supplies cannot get in. They later back off that plan and say they may just issue fines, but retreat from that idea as well. Nov. 30 A group of U.S. veterans announce they will bring more than 2,000 service members to North Dakota to stand as human shields between the protesters and law enforcement. They begin arriving over the next several days. Dec. 4 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denies Energy Transfer Partners\u2019 request for an easement to run under Lake Oahe, sparking a celebration amongst protesters. ETP says it will continue to fight for the line. The incoming Trump administration has said it supports Dakota Access, along with other pipeline projects. Jan. 18  The Army Corps says it will publish a notice in the Federal Register stating its intent to prepare an environmental impact statement for the easement at Lake Oahe. ETP files a motion asking a court to bar the action in an effort to move the pipeline forward. Jan. 24 President Trump, who previously owned stock in Energy Transfer Partners, signs an order aimed at moving the pipeline, along with an unrelated pipeline, Keystone XL, to go forward.  ",

        "title": "EU signs defense pact in decades-long quest",
        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France and Germany edged toward achieving a 70-year-old ambition to integrate European defenses on Monday, signing a pact with 21 other EU governments to fund, develop and deploy armed forces after Britain s decision to quit the bloc. First proposed in the 1950s and long resisted by Britain, European defense planning, operations and weapons development now stands its best chance in years as London steps aside and the United States pushes Europe to pay more for its security. Foreign and defense ministers gathered at a signing ceremony in Brussels to represent 23 EU governments joining the pact, paving the way for EU leaders to sign it in December.  Those governments will for the first time legally bind themselves into joint projects as well as pledging to increase defense spending and contribute to rapid deployments.  Today we are taking a historic step,  Germany s Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told reporters.  We are agreeing on the future cooperation on security and defense issues ... it s really a milestone in European development,  he said. The pact includes all EU governments except Britain, which is leaving the bloc, Denmark, which has opted out of defense matters, Ireland, Portugal and Malta. Traditionally neutral Austria was a late addition to the pact.   Paris originally wanted a vanguard of EU countries to bring money and assets to French-led military missions and projects, while Berlin has sought to be more inclusive, which could reduce effectiveness. Its backers say that if successful, the formal club of 23 members will give the European Union a more coherent role in tackling international crises and end the kind of shortcomings seen in Libya in 2011, when European allies relied on the United States for air power and munitions. Unlike past attempts, the U.S.-led NATO alliance backs the project, aiming to benefit from stronger militaries. The club will be backed by a 5-billion-euro defense fund for buying weapons, a special fund to finance operations and money from the EU s common budget for defense research. Members will also be required to submit national plans and be subject to a review system identifying weak spots in European armies with the goal of plugging those gaps together. Many governments say Russia s seizure of Ukraine s Crimea in 2014 was a turning point, after years of defense spending cuts that left Europe without vital capabilities.   This is a commitment for countries to do better together,  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said.  It comes at a time of significant tension,  he said, referring indirectly to Russia s rising military reach and Islamic militants who have attacked European cities. Despite an Anglo-French-led EU defense integration effort in 1998, Britain blocked formal collaboration on military matters, wary of the creation of an EU army. Defense integration was revived by France and Germany, with support from Italy and Spain, in a show of unity after Britons voted to leave the EU in June 2016. The EU had struggled in military and humanitarian missions in the Balkans, Libya and in Africa over the past 20 years and were caught off guard by Russia s Crimea annexation. As the EU initiative, known as Permanent Structured Cooperation, has gained momentum, British officials have been pressing for involvement. Britain s aerospace industry and its biggest defense firm BAE Systems (BAES.L) fear losing out, diplomats said.  British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson likened London s support to Gothic architecture, saying:  We are there, like a flying buttress to support the cathedral,  he told reporters.  In a possible compromise, Britain may be able to join in, but only on an exceptional basis if it provides substantial funds and expertise. ",

        "title": "Franchises appeal Seattle minimum wage case to U.S. Supreme Court",
        "text": "(Reuters) - A business group said on Monday it was asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its appeal of a lower-court ruling tossing out its challenge of part of Seattle\u2019s law to increase the minimum wage. The International Franchise Association, which brought its lawsuit against the city in June 2014, says the law favors independent businesses because it requires franchises like McDonald\u2019s and Burger King to phase in the new $15 minimum wage more quickly.  \u201cOur appeal has never sought to prevent the City of Seattle\u2019s wage law from going into effect,\u201d association President Robert Cresanti\u00a0said in a statement.  \u201cOur appeal to the Supreme Court will be focused solely on the discriminatory treatment of franchisees under Seattle\u2019s wage law and the motivation to discriminate against interstate commerce,\u201d he said. The association\u2019s lawsuit challenges the law\u2019s treatment of franchises as subsidiaries of parent companies, rather than completely separate businesses. Representatives for the city could not be immediately reached for comment. Commenting on the lawsuit last year, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, a Democrat who championed the wage hike, said: \u201cRather than investing in lawyers to prevent workers from earning higher wages, it is time for these large businesses to begin investing in a higher minimum wage for their employees.\u201d  A federal judge last March denied the group\u2019s lawsuit, saying it failed to back up its discrimination claims. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision in September. The law, which took effect on April 1 last year, requires businesses in Seattle with more than 500 employees nationwide to raise their minimum wage to $15 by 2018. Smaller companies have until 2021. Seattle is among a number of large U.S. cities to pass laws raising the minimum wage above $10 an hour. The franchise association\u2019s lawsuit could have an impact in cities like Chicago and San Francisco.

        "title": "Asia investors, traders bet on Clinton win after bruising election debate",
        "text": "SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Investors and traders in Asia indicated on Monday they are mostly increasing their bets on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton winning the U.S. presidential race after the second of three debates with Republican party nominee Donald Trump.  Some, though remain cautious, saying there was still a chance of a surprise Trump win. They said many in the markets were wary after being burned by the shock \u201cBrexit\u201d vote in June. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up around 0.1 percent by mid-afternoon in Singapore on Monday, while Wall Street index futures were little changed after Clinton exchanged barbs with Republican party nominee Donald Trump in the televised event, which was shown live across trading rooms during Asia\u2019s morning.  The 90-minute debate quickly turned into an acrimonious discussion of a 2005 video that emerged on Friday in which Trump was heard using vulgar language and talking about groping women.  The controversy has caused some senior Republicans to withdraw their support for him.  \u201cFor those that think that Trump has a very, very low chance of winning the U.S. elections it might be a good time to go long on global equities,\u201d said Itay Tuchman, Citi\u2019s head of markets for Australia and New Zealand. Markets could be prematurely pricing in a Clinton victory, as they did during the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote in June, when the United Kingdom voted unexpectedly to leave the European Union, said Lee Jin Yang, research analyst for Aberdeen Asset Management in Singapore. \u201cWe need to remember that Brexit only became a key focus one week before the vote. The market had priced in near zero probability of it happening but it did.\u201d  According to a CNN online poll, Clinton won the debate by  57 percent to 34 percent. But Josh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors in Hong Kong, said he is wary of such polls - especially after Brexit.  \u201cThe way that mainstream media, and a lot of commentators, interpret the outcome of the debate may be different to what the voting public in general takes away,\u201d Crabb said. \u201cThat is a concern because often, a lot of these polls have not been quite as accurate as people are expecting.\u201d Mathan Somasundarum, a strategist at stock brokerage Baillieu Holst in Sydney, said a Clinton victory would reduce the risk of the United States adopting a strong trade protectionist policy. Trump has been highly critical of the NAFTA trade deal with Mexico and Canada as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has yet to be ratified by the U.S. Congress. He has promised to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. \u201cI would expect the U.S. dollar to weaken and you would expect then there is some pressure coming off emerging markets, and then commodities, which (are a) proxy for emerging markets,\u201d Somasundarum said. \u201cChina, commodities and the Aussie dollar should do better.\u201d While the markets had already begun to price in a Clinton victory even before the Republican party\u2019s crisis over Trump\u2019s 2005 remarks, some are beginning to game out what would happen if the Democrats won both houses of Congress, which are now Republican controlled.  The possibility of the Democrats controlling Congress and the White House is a concern to some in the markets as they see it leading to more regulation of businesses and higher taxes. \u201cOver time, people will start thinking, is this going to mean a big difference in the way taxation works? Is it going to mean more government involvement?,\u201d said Crabb at Old Mutual Global in Hong Kong. \u201cBut the immediate reaction will be a relief rally.\u201d Angus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management in Sydney, said while markets usually view one party dominating the government as a risk, it could be different this time. \u201cInvestors have been disappointed by the political stalemate over recent years, which has prevented meaningful and well-needed changes being pursued,\u201d Gluskie said. Steven Friedman, senior investment strategist at BNP Paris bas Investment Partners in New York, said he saw little in the debate that represented a game-changer for either candidate. \u201cThis obviously plays to Clinton\u2019s advantage, given her lead in the polls,\u201d he said. Strategists in a recent Reuters equity poll mostly viewed an election victory on Nov. 8 by Clinton as more positive for the stock market through the end of the year, largely because her positions - unlike her opponent\u2019s - are well-known.  Chris Brankin, chief executive at stock brokerage TD Ameritrade Asia, said he thought Trump was much better prepared for the town hall debate in St. Louis than he was for the first debate, and that could give markets some pause.  \u201cI have always said markets \u2018know what they get\u2019 with Hillary, as she as always been seen as pro-Wall Street and Trump is a bit of an unknown for investors.\u00a0  \u201cAfter tonight\u2019s debate I still think there are a lot of questions as who will be elected into office next month and markets are probably going to remain range-bound till after the U.S. elections.\u201d ",

        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - German parliamentary legal experts, reacting to calls by some Polish politicians, have ruled that Warsaw has no right to demand Berlin pay reparations for World War Two, according to a document obtained by a German newspaper. The experts found any claims related to German crimes had become unfeasible at latest in 1990 when a treaty was signed by East and West Germany, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States ahead of German reunification, according to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). The experts, who provide independent advice to the German parliament, said EU partner Poland  had, during the treaty negotiations, at least implicitly waived their right to assert them , FAZ cited the report as saying. They said it was agreed back then that this treaty  blocks any reparation demands against Germany to the present day , FAZ reported. In recent weeks, Polish politicians and officials have stepped up calls for compensation, but the government has yet to officially demand any reparations.  Johannes Singhammer, the vice-president of the Bundestag lower house and a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU), had commissioned the report. He told FAZ:  The Polish demand for reparations, which does not stand a chance from a legal point of view, is contrary to the joint future project between Germany and Poland and could instead have dangerous effects.  On Thursday, Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said that by seeking reparations, Poland would be asking for justice.  We are the victims of World War Two, the damages have not been repaid in any way, quite to the contrary,  Szydlo said.  Several Polish government sources told Reuters that it is unlikely Poland will officially ask for repayments, but it also could not be completely ruled out.  ",

        "text": "COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Turkey s prime minister on Wednesday dubbed the killing of minority Muslim Rohingyas in Myanmar by its security forces  genocide  and urged the international community to ensure their safety back home. Binali Yildirim met several Rohingyas in two refugee camps in Cox s Bazar in neighboring Bangladesh. Almost 870,000 Rohingya fled there, about 660,000 of whom arrived after Aug. 25, when Rohingya militants attacked security posts and the Myanmar army launched a counter-offensive.  The Myanmar military has been trying to uproot Rohingya Muslim community from their homeland and for that they persecuted them, set fire to their homes, villages, raped and abused women and killed them,  Yildirim told reporters from Cox s Bazar, before flying back to Turkey.  It s one kind of a genocide,  he said.  The international community should also work together to ensure their safe and dignified return to their homeland,  Yildirim, who was accompanied by Bangladesh s Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali, said. Surveys of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh by aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres have shown at least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in Rakhine state in the month after violence flared up on Aug. 25, MSF said last week. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein has called the violence  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing  and said he would not be surprised if a court eventually ruled that genocide had taken place. Yildirim inaugurated a medical camp at Balukhali, sponsored by Turkey, and handed over two ambulances to Cox s Bazar district administration. He also distributed food to Rohingya refugees at Kutupalong makeshift camp. He urged the international community to enhance support for Rohingyas in Bangladesh and help find a political solution to this humanitarian crisis. U.N. investigators have heard Rohingya testimony of a  consistent, methodical pattern of killings, torture, rape and arson . The United Nations defines genocide as acts meant to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part. Such a designation is rare under international law, but has been used in contexts including Bosnia, Sudan and an Islamic State campaign against the Yazidi communities in Iraq and Syria. Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi s less than two-year old civilian government has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis, though it has no control over the generals it has to share power with under Myanmar s transition after decades of military rule. Yildirim s trip follows Turkish first lady Emine Erdogan s visit in September to the Rohingya camp, when she said the crack down in Myanmar s Rakhine state was  tantamount to genocide  and a solution to the Rohingya crisis lies in Myanmar alone.

Ambassador Cui Tiankai, speaking to executives of top U.S. companies, said China and the United States needed to work to strengthen their relationship.    \u201cThe political foundation of China-U.S. relations should not be undermined. It should be preserved,\u201d Cui said. \u201cAnd basic norms of international relations should be observed, not ignored, certainly not be seen as something you can trade off,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd indeed, national sovereignty and territorial integrity are not bargaining chips. Absolutely not. I hope everybody would understand that.\u201d He did not specifically mention Taiwan, or Trump\u2019s comments last weekend that the United States did not necessarily have to stick to its nearly four-decade policy of recognizing that Taiwan is part of \u201cone China.\u201d Cui\u2019s remarks were in line with recent protests from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, which regards the \u201cone China\u201d principle as the \u201cpolitical basis\u201d for U.S.-China ties.. Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. China considers Taiwan independence a red line issue. On Thursday, China\u2019s influential state-run tabloid the Global Times said China needed to take the lead in deciding the island\u2019s future. \u201cIt is hoped that peace in the Taiwan Straits won\u2019t be disrupted. But the Chinese mainland should display its resolution to recover Taiwan by force. Peace does not belong to cowards,\u201d it said in an editorial. Trump, in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d suggested that the U.S. position on Taiwan could become part of his pledge to negotiate more favorable trade terms with China. \u201cI fully understand the \u2018one China\u2019 policy, but I don\u2019t know why we have to be bound by a \u2018one China\u2019 policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s comments came after he prompted a diplomatic protest from China over his decision to accept a telephone call from Taiwan\u2019s president on Dec. 2. U.S. corporate executives are increasingly pessimistic about their business prospects in China in light of tough restrictions on foreign investment in the country\u2019s vast service sector, new cyber-security regulations that favor domestic technologies and weak enforcement of intellectual property protections. Earlier on Wednesday, news that Chinese officials may penalize a U.S. automaker for monopolistic pricing behavior pushed down shares of General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N).

        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Traces of a deadly nerve agent that killed the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were found on the clothes worn by the two women accused of the sensational murder, a Malaysian court was told on Thursday. Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese, are charged with murdering Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a chemical poison banned by the United Nations, at Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13. A chemical weapons expert with the Malaysian government said his analysis showed traces of VX, its precursors and degradation products on the sleeves of a T-shirt worn by Huong, as well as VX degradation products on Siti Aisyah s sleeveless shirt.      The presence of precursors and VX confirms the presence of VX itself,  the expert, Raja Subramaniam, told the court outside the Malaysian capital.  I also found degradation products of VX, which confirms the presence of VX.  The testimony was used to back the prosecution s position that VX was used in the murder and was the sole cause of death, a scenario defense lawyers disputed this week. [nL4N1ME159] In response to a prosecution question, Raja agreed that VX could be applied on a bare palm and potentially have no effect on a person if washed off quickly enough. The lethality of VX depended on the dosage and where on the body it was applied, he added.  The concentration required varies by a factor of 26, from the cheek, which is sensitive, to the palm, which is least sensitive, to have the same effect,  Raja said. Raja said penetration of VX into the body is highest in areas with higher concentrations of blood, such as the head, neck, eyes and ears. On the least sensitive areas, such as the palm, where larger amounts of tissue and fat deposits block absorption, Raja said an individual would have up to 15 minutes to wash off the nerve poison with running water.  If you decontaminate within 15 minutes, most likely no effect or delayed effect (from VX),  Raja said, citing studies on human test subjects. The women have pleaded not guilty, saying they thought they were involved in some sort of prank for a reality TV show. They face the death penalty if convicted.

        "text": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Three judges in Hong Kong s Court of Appeal are set to decide the fate of a former British banker who was jailed for life last year for the murder of two Indonesian women he tortured and raped after his appeal hearing closed on Wednesday.    Rurik Jutting, 32, a former Bank of America employee, had denied murdering Sumarti Ningsih, 23, and Seneng Mujiasih, 26, in his luxury apartment in 2014 on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to alcohol and drug abuse and sexual disorders. The Cambridge-educated Jutting pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in a case that gripped the Asian financial hub. During the one and a half day appeal hearing in the former British colony, Jutting s lawyers said the judge who presided over the gruesome trial last year had misdirected the jury. Defence lawyer Gerard McCoy argued that the judge had narrowed down the scope of the defence case by conflating an abnormality of mind with a psychiatric disorder. Jutting s defence is that while a disorder can cause an abnormal mind, his mental state can be abnormal without a disorder. McCoy said Jutting showed severe traits of psychiatric disorders, far beyond the normal range and was therefore not in control of his actions, said McCoy.  Abnormality of mind is absolutely not confined to a disorder or a disease. Here the judge locks it down, reinforcing to the jury it is disorder,  he said. Jutting, dressed in a navy blue shirt and thick squared glasses, watched animatedly throughout the hearing and occasionally chuckled, particularly during the presentations by prosecutor John Reading. Reading stated that the previous judge had  exercised considerable care in crafting his directions on the law in consultation with both sides . Judges Michael Lunn, Andrew Macrae and Kevin Zervos are to return judgement on the appeal which may include granting Jutting the opportunity for a new trial, but they did not give a time frame.  Deputy High Court Judge Michael Stuart-Moore said in strongly worded closing remarks at the end of the trial last year that the case was one of the most horrifying the Chinese-ruled territory had known. He described Jutting as the  archetypal sexual predator  who represented an extreme danger to women, especially in the sex trade, and cautioned that it was possible he would murder again if freed. The jury unanimously found Jutting, the grandson of a British policeman in Hong Kong and a Chinese woman, guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison in November 2016. Jutting s defence team had previously argued that cocaine and alcohol abuse, as well as personality disorders of sexual sadism and narcissism, had impaired his ability to control his behavior. The prosecution rejected this, stating Jutting was able to form judgments and exercise self-control before and after the killings, filming his torture of Ningsih on his mobile phone as well as hours of footage in which he discussed the murders, bingeing on cocaine and his graphic sexual fantasies. In previous high profile murder cases such as that of Nancy Kissel, an American woman serving a life sentence for the  milkshake  murder of her Merrill Lynch banker husband, retrials have been given.  Kissel lost her final appeal against her conviction in 2014.   ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - A third of Republican voters who support Donald Trump could turn their backs on their party in November\u2019s presidential election if he is denied the nomination in a contested convention, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The results are bad news for Trump\u2019s rivals as well as party elites opposed to the real estate billionaire, suggesting that an alternative Republican nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential race would have a tougher road against the Democrats. \u201cIf it\u2019s a close election, this is devastating news\u201d for the Republicans, said Donald Green, an expert on election turnout at Columbia University.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted March 30 to April 8 asked Trump\u2019s Republican supporters two questions: if Trump wins the most delegates in the primaries but loses the nomination, what would they do on Election Day, and how would it impact their relationship with the Republican Party? Sixty-six percent said they would vote for the candidate who eventually wins the nomination, while the remaining third were split between a number of alternatives such as not voting, supporting a third-party candidate, and switching parties and voting for the Democratic nominee.  Meanwhile, 58 percent said they would remain with the Republican Party. Another 16 percent said they would leave it, and 26 percent said they did not know what they would do with their registration. The online poll of 468 Republican Trump supporters has a credibility interval of 5.3 percentage points. (Click here for the poll results: tmsnrt.rs/25PRLZe ) Trump has topped the national polls throughout most of the race for the Republican nomination, and has won more delegates than any other Republican so far. A Reuters/Ipsos online poll from April 4-8 showed that 42 percent of Republicans support Trump, compared with 32 percent for U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and 20 percent for Ohio Governor John Kasich. [L2N17B1J0] Cruz and Kasich have both said their paths to victory rely on winning at least enough votes to block an outright win for Trump and force a decision at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. But Trump, whose supporters have remained loyal even as he rankled women, Hispanics, Muslims, veterans and others with his fiery rhetoric on the campaign trail, predicted last month there would be riots outside the convention if he was blocked. \u201cIf they broker him out, I\u2019ll be fed up with the Republicans,\u201d said Chuck Thompson, 66, a Trump supporter from Concord, North Carolina, who took the poll.  Thompson, a lifelong Republican, said he admires Trump\u2019s independence from big campaign donors and takes that as a sign that the front-runner will be able to think for himself if he were to become president.  If Trump loses the nomination, Thompson said he would quit the party. \u201cThe people want Donald Trump. If they (Republicans) can\u2019t deal with that, I don\u2019t need them,\u201d he said. Green said the departure of even a small number of Republicans would make it tough for the party to prevent the Democrats from winning the White House, especially if the election is again decided by razor-thin margins in a handful of battleground states.  In 2012, President Barack Obama won Florida by less than 1 percentage point and Ohio and Virginia by less than 4 percentage points. \u201cThe Republicans don\u2019t really have any margin of error,\u201d Green said. Trump and Cruz both trail Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton among likely general election voters in a hypothetical general election matchup, but not by much, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos polls. Generally, a convention battle is a bad sign for the health of a political party, said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of the book, \u201cPrimary Politics: How Presidential Candidates Have Shaped the Modern Nominating System.\u201d  \u201cWhen a party gets to a point when it has a contested convention, it almost always hurts them,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cIt\u2019s a confirmation of some really deep fissures within the party that were unable to be dealt with during the primary season.\u201d Trump supporter Elizabeth Oerther, 40, of Louisville, Kentucky, said she would switch parties and vote for the Democratic nominee if the Republicans denied Trump the nomination.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t give it to him, I\u2019m going to vote against them,\u201d said Oerther, who took the poll. \u201cThey want to take away the choice of the people. That\u2019s wrong.\u201d ",

        "title": "Egypt election in view, Sisi supporters fire up campaign for mandate",
        "text": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Six months before Egypt s election, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi s supporters are petitioning for him to run, rallying around the former military commander whose popularity critics say has been dimmed by austerity reforms, security problems and a crackdown on dissidents.   Four years ago, Sisi won a landslide victory after he led the military ouster of then president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, promising stability following Egypt s 2011 Arab Spring uprising.   Sisi, 62, has yet to declare if he will run, though he is unlikely to face strong opposition. He says he will follow the people s will, and many in Egypt still see him as key to stability in a country where unrest since 2011 has battered the economy.   But some critics say that narrative has been undercut by tough austerity reforms and a currency flotation that has made even the middle-class poorer, and an Islamic insurgency that has extended outside its battleground in the northern Sinai,     The  So You Can Build It  petition campaign launched by a businessman, professors and pro-Sisi independent lawmakers is looking to whip up turnout for Sisi and show he still has the legitimacy of a popular mandate. Less than a month into the campaign, its founders claim they will rally massive support. A host of celebrities have signed up, posing on social media with petition forms that show Egypt s red, white and black flag, and a silhouette of the pyramids.   We will find out from the numbers we have collected what the Egyptian people s support looks like ... especially since there are rumors that there s been a decline in popular support,  said Mohamed Shaaban, the campaign s co-founder and an independent lawmaker allied with Sisi.  Some Sisi opponents say the scale of the campaign shows that Egyptians have few viable opposition candidates to choose from in the election likely to happen around April.  All this negatively affects the political climate in Egypt and increases reluctance to run against Sisi,  Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, nephew of a former president who once backed Sisi but is now considering running against him, said last week.  It will discourage voters and make them more reluctant to go out and vote in the upcoming elections.  Detractors have taken to social media to poke fun at the petition, posting pictures of aliens and U.S. President Donald Trump signing the form. Others have suggested a counter-movement calling instead for Sisi to step down. Under Sisi s presidency, thousands of dissidents have been jailed, the government has shut down independent media and heavily restricted the conducting of opinion polls. There have been no official polls on the upcoming election yet.  However, many Egyptians are wary of challenging the status quo after six years of living through a pro-democracy revolt, a military takeover and a prolonged state of emergency that has left people unwilling to protest or looking for stability. Only two people   Sadat and Khaled Ali, a lawyer who challenged Sisi over a dispute about two islands in the Red Sea   have publicly aired the idea of challenging him and even they say Sisi is likely to win. Last election, Sisi won about 97 percent of the vote on a turnout of 47.5 percent, after voting was extended for a day. This time, his backers want to show his legitimacy not been tarnished by economic and security problems.   The issue is not whether Sisi will win the 2018 election; rather, it is about how much interest and buzz can be generated about the process,  said H.A. Hellyer, senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council.  The more public interest, the better - if turnout and interest is minimal, that won t be catastrophic for the authorities, but is certainly not the image they wish to project domestically or internationally, he added. The campaign was inspired by the 2013  Tamaroud , or  Rebellion , petition, that Sisi used as a mandate to topple the Muslim Brotherhood, said Shaaban. The Tamaroud movement encouraged millions of Egyptians to take to the streets demanding the overthrow of Mursi. Sisi then led the military ouster of Mursi after those protests. Organisers says they are already seeing results. What started off with only 10 offices has mushroomed into a large-scale operation with 178 offices nationwide, said Shaaban, and close to half a million likes on the campaign s official Facebook page.  The numbers are changing by the moment,  said parliamentarian Karim Salem, campaign spokesman and co-founder. Organisers say the campaign is run by volunteers and funded by private donations. Egypt s state news agency reported that 14,000 people had signed the petition in the Nile delta province of Al-Beheira. Reuters could not independently confirm these numbers. The petition form lists five reasons why Sisi should seek a second term   cleansing the country of terrorism, completing his megaprojects, ending corruption, education, and protecting its leadership. Even some of Sisi s supporters who helped propel him into power, such as former campaign officials Hazim Abdelazim and Nour al-Huda Zaki, have turned against him over his handling of the economy and security. Critics point to a dispute that saw his government hand over two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, touching a nationalistic nerve. Egypt has fought an insurgency waged by an Islamic State affiliate in North Sinai since 2013. Hundreds of members of the security forces have been killed. But the group has begun turning its guns towards the mainland in attacks this year. Sisi has inaugurated mega infrastructure projects he promised would turn around the economy, and the IMF has praised the progress of measures it has backed that are meant to curb deficits and create long term growth. But many Egyptians say they are frustrated with the immediate fallout of reforms. The currency devaluation a year ago has cut the Egyptian pound s value in half   though it has stabilised now - and inflation is just off record highs of above 30 percent. In Shaaban s home district in Cairo, middle-class Sayeda Zeinab, where a petition campaign banner with an image of the smiling president hangs above a main square, Essam Moahmed, a baker, expressed discontent over the economy.  Now things are even more expensive than under the Brotherhood. But people can t stand against Sisi,  he said. Sisi acknowledges the tough economic situation many Egyptians face, saying sacrifices like IMF-backed austerity reforms are needed  so we can take our true place.  ",

        "title": "Kansas asks U.S. appeals court to reinstate strict voter ID rule",
        "text": "DENVER (Reuters) - Kansas on Tuesday asked a U.S. appeals court to reinstate rules requiring proof of U.S. citizenship from people registering to vote, the latest political battle over stringent identification laws enacted in Republican-led states ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The mandate that Kansans present passports, birth certificates or other proof of citizenship when registering to vote while obtaining driver\u2019s licenses was challenged by a U.S. District Court judge in May. Her ruling restored the right to vote in the Nov. 8 election for thousands of people who were asked if they wanted to register while at motor vehicle offices, but not required to submit the additional documentation. Judge Julie Robinson ordered those people to be re-registered. She said that Kansas could identify only three non-citizens who voted between 2003 and the onset of the law in 2013. Kansas\u2019 law is one of the strictest voter identification statutes in the country, making the state a symbol for mostly Republican Party supporters who say the rules are meant to prevent voter fraud. Opponents, mostly Democrats, say they discriminate against minorities. \u201cEvery time a noncitizen votes, it effectively cancels out the vote of a citizen,\u201d Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said in court filings ahead of Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments. In arguments before the Denver-based U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, Kobach said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be authorized by the federal government\u201d to set up rules to manage state and local elections. Arguing for the lower court\u2019s decision to be upheld, the American Civil Liberties Union specifically targeted a portion of Kansas law that deals with people who register to vote at motor vehicle department offices. The ACLU argued that the requirement conflicts with a federal law from 1993 aimed at making it easier for people to register to vote by doing so when they apply for a driver\u2019s license.  Because that law does not require people to bring more documentation than they would need to get a driver\u2019s license, Robinson ruled that about 18,000 people whose registration had been invalidated by the state should be re-registered. Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump, who earlier this month said that voters who opposed his candidacy are \u201cgoing to vote 10 times,\u201d is asking supporters to volunteer to be election observers at the polls. He routinely calls Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton \u201ccrooked\u201d and has said that if he loses, it will be because the system is rigged against him. Led by lawyers from the ACLU, opponents of the voter identification laws have filed lawsuits in several states, successfully overturning or delaying implementation of some statutes.  Last month, a federal judge in Wisconsin ruled that voters who do not have photo identification will be able to vote in the  presidential election, and the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a North Carolina law requiring voters to bring a photo ID to the polls. Seventeen states have put new voting restrictions in place since the last presidential contest, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. ",

        "title": "North Korea would not commit to peace talks but 'door ajar': U.N. envoy",
        "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman said on Tuesday that senior North Korean officials did not offer any type of commitment to talks during his visit to Pyongyang last week, but he believes he left  the door ajar.  Feltman, the highest-level U.N. official to visit North Korea since 2011, met with Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho and Vice Minister Pak Myong Guk during a four-day visit that he described as  the most important mission I have ever undertaken.   Time will tell what was the impact of our discussions, but I think we have left the door ajar and I fervently hope that the door to a negotiated solution will now be opened wide,  Feltman told reporters after briefing the U.N. Security Council behind closed doors on his visit.   They need time to digest and consider how they will respond to our message,  he said, adding that he believed Ri would brief North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on their discussions. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered on Tuesday to begin direct talks with North Korea without pre-conditions, backing away from U.S. demands that Pyongyang must first accept that any negotiations would have to be about giving up its nuclear arsenal. Feltman said he asked North Korea to signal that it was prepared to consider engagement like possible  talks about talks  and to open  technical channels of communication, such as the military-to-military hotline, to reduce risks, to signal intentions, to prevent misunderstandings and manage any crisis.   They listened seriously to our arguments ... They did not offer any type of commitment to us at that point,  said Feltman.  They agreed it was important to prevent war ... How we do that was the topic of 15-plus hours of discussions.  He said the United Nations could act as a facilitator.  North Korea is pursuing nuclear and missile weapons programs in defiance of U.N. sanctions and international condemnation. On Nov. 29, it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile which it said was its most advanced yet, capable of reaching the mainland United States.  Feltman described his visit as  constructive and productive  and said the North Koreans agreed to continue a dialogue.   The people who we met listened carefully to our arguments, they explored our thinking, they asked questions, they argued with us, but ultimately they have to take what we said and talk about it internally, talk about it with their leadership,  he said.

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton launched a bid on Thursday to draw young voters and small donors to her campaign, targeting the strengths of her rival, Bernie Sanders, as she looks ahead to the general election. Dubbed \u201cfor45\u201d - for Clinton as the 45th president of the United States - the group will offer associate level membership for as low as $250, according to an invitation seen by Reuters for an April 25 Philadelphia event. \u201cWe will have an opportunity to fundraise and host low-dollar events, speaking to what we are passionate about and why we support her,\u201d said Akilah Ensley, a 32-year-old Clinton supporter planning to join the group. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we engage.\u201d      The group held its \u201ckick-off\u201d conference call on Thursday, featuring the Clinton campaign\u2019s finance director, Dennis Cheng, other campaign officials, and actress Lena Dunham, according to an invitation to the call. The group includes two other tiers, according to an information sheet seen by Reuters - a \u201cmember\u201d level with minimum fundraising of $2,500 and an \u201cadvisor\u201d level for raising at least $10,000. The Clinton and Sanders campaigns did not respond to  requests for comment.  The formation of the group underscores the challenge facing the former secretary of state in winning over the young people who have helped power Sanders\u2019 run. Younger voters are a critical voting block and source of financing should she win the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election. Clinton has a commanding delegate lead over Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, and checked his momentum by winning New York\u2019s primary earlier this week. But she has struggled to attract younger voters. While she won New York on Tuesday by 16 points, Sanders took 65 percent of Democratic voters aged 18 to 29, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research and published in the New York Times. Younger voters have also turned out more heavily for Sanders in other states. Sanders so often boasts about his average donation level of $27 that rally crowds now shout the number out along with him.  Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist in Florida who is not affiliated with the Clinton campaign, said for45 was a \u201csmart way\u201d to begin courting Sanders\u2019 supporters. He compared it with the \u201cGen44\u201d group of young voters that supported President Barack Obama.  \u201cAnything that spurs people to get involved financially, it just builds more ownership in the campaign,\u201d he said.

        "title": "States ratchet up transgender battle with lawsuit against U.S.",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Officials from 11 U.S. states sued the Obama administration on Wednesday to overturn a directive telling schools to let transgender students use bathrooms matching their gender identity, decrying the policy as \u201ca massive social experiment.\u201d Ramping up the simmering battles over contentious cultural issues in America, the states, led by Texas and most with Republican governors, accused the federal government of rewriting laws by \u201cadministrative fiat.\u201d \u201cWe are willing to fight this all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to,\u201d Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told reporters in Austin.  Amid a national debate on transgender rights, President Barack Obama\u2019s administration on May 13 told U.S. public schools that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and paving the way for fights over federal funding and legal authority. The states\u2019 lawsuit accused the federal government of overstepping its constitutional powers by taking actions that should be left to Congress or individual states. It also challenged the Obama administration\u2019s interpretation of federal civil rights law with regard to sex and gender. The lawsuit said the administration \u201cconspired to turn workplace and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights.\u201d Texas was joined by Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin, plus Arizona\u2019s Department of Education and Maine\u2019s governor. Paxton said, \u201cIt\u2019s about parents who are upset, grandparents who are upset. They want to see that the safety of their children is taken care of.\u201d Transgender rights advocates argued it is transgender people who need protection, particularly transgender women who are disproportionately the victims of assaults and would be forced to use men\u2019s bathrooms if states succeed in forcing people to use bathrooms matching their sex at birth. Likewise, transgender men, many of whom grow facial hair, would be required to use women\u2019s bathrooms along with girls. \u201cThis action puts students at risk for the sake of politics,\u201d said Alison Gill of the Trans United Fund advocacy group supporting transgender rights. Gill said the states\u2019 lawsuit did not reflect the position of most school boards and administrators. The administration\u2019s letter to the schools said that to get federal funding under existing rules, schools must agree not to treat students or activities differently on the basis of sex. That includes not treating transgender students differently from others of the same gender identity, officials said. Paul Castillo, a lawyer with Lambda Legal, which supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, said the lawsuit represented an \u201cunprecedented attack against transgender people across the United States.\u201d \u201cThese states are demonstrating the great lengths they will go to in order to discriminate against transgender individuals,\u201d Castillo said. Nine of the 11 states that sued have Republican governors, including Maine\u2019s Paul LePage. LePage broke with the Democratic attorney general, Janet Mills, who did not approve of the lawsuit, a spokesman for Mills said. School districts from Texas and Arizona also joined the suit, which names the U.S. government and a host of federal  agencies and officials as defendants. North Carolina sued the federal government on the transgender bathroom issue this month, seeking to protect its state law passed in March that bans people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their sex assigned at birth. Ever since the 1960s civil rights movement, the federal government has asserted its authority to force states to extend equal protection under the law for all. The administration sued North Carolina on May 9, stating that its transgender bathroom law violated the U.S. 1964 Civil Rights Act. The 11 states\u2019 lawsuit accused the administration of taking that argument too far and improperly, widening the scope of interpretation of civil rights law. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities. The administration\u2019s interpretation is that the word \u201csex\u201d extends protection to transgender people, but the issue has not been settled in the courts. \u201cI agree with the Obama administration that \u2018sex\u2019 includes \u2018gender,\u2019 and \u2018gender\u2019 includes \u2018gender identity,\u2019\u201d said John Pagan of the University of Richmond\u2019s School of Law in Virginia. Peter Lake of Stetson University College of Law in Florida said the U.S. Supreme Court has taken a narrow view of the meaning of \u201csex\u201d under the law, but in recent years lower courts have been more likely to defer to the Obama administration\u2019s broader definition. \u201cMy sense is a certain momentum is building for broader protection of (LGBT) rights, and we might be seeing a moment of federal civil rights law in long-term transition,\u201d Lake said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",

But spokesman Josh Earnest said there was \u201cno offense taken\u201d by the decision which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday ascribed to a desire to steer clear of the U.S. presidential election campaign. It was the latest episode in a fraught relationship between the right-wing Israeli leader and the Democratic U.S. president that has yet to recover from deep differences over last year\u2019s U.S.-led international nuclear deal with Israel\u2019s foe Iran. In a stark reminder of the paralysis in peace talks which Obama tried to revive earlier in his tenure, an American tourist was stabbed to death on a boardwalk in Tel Aviv in the most serious of several Palestinian attacks on Tuesday. The stabbing occurred about the time U.S. Vice President Joe Biden began a two-day visit to Israel. Biden met former Israeli president Shimon Peres and was due to hold talks on Wednesday with Netanyahu in Jerusalem and with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the occupied West Bank. With a wave of Palestinian street attacks now five months old, U.S. officials did not expect a peace breakthrough during Biden\u2019s visit. A 2010 Biden visit was marred by acrimony over a Jewish settlement plan Israel announced during his trip.  The White House said on Monday it had been \u201csurprised\u201d to learn first from Israeli media that Netanyahu had decided against coming to a conference of the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC in Washington on March 20, and to see a suggestion in some reports that Obama\u2019s unavailability had been one of the reasons. It said Netanyahu had been offered a March 18 meeting with Obama, ahead of the president\u2019s landmark visit to Cuba on March 21 and 22. Asked whether the Netanyahu government should have told the Obama administration before the media, Earnest said on Tuesday, \u201cI think it\u2019s just good manners.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0  Zeev Elkin, an Israeli cabinet minister close to Netanyahu, countered that Israeli ambassador Ron Dermer had given the White House advance warning the trip might not happen. Netanyahu\u2019s office cited the U.S. election campaign in saying he would not travel to Washington for the AIPAC event, and voiced appreciation for Obama\u2019s willingness to host him. In 2012, Netanyahu hosted Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney in Israel in what many Democrats saw as a bid to undermine Obama\u2019s attempt to secure a second term. Israel denied meddling. While candidates for the Republican and Democratic presidential nomination have been vying to assert their credentials as friends of Israel, Obama is not up for re-election in November, having served a maximum two terms.  Earnest said Biden was not in Israel to handle talks over a memorandum of understanding about the United States providing military support to Israel. There was a separate channel through which those negotiations were taking place, he said. ",

        "title": "Boris Johnson gives PM May advice on Brexit while parading loyalty",
        "text": "MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson offered Theresa May unsolicited public advice about how to make Brexit a success on Tuesday, delicately testing the extent of the prime minister s weakened authority while pledging overt loyalty. Alongside public proclamations of backing for May, he used media articles and interviews ahead of the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester to offer up his own vision of a bold Brexit. After praising May for winning a snap June election which lost her party its majority in parliament, Johnson used his main speech to say that her top ministers were united behind  every syllable  of her Brexit plans set out last month in Florence.  The whole country owes her a debt for her steadfastness in taking Britain forward, as she will, to a great Brexit deal, based on that Florence speech on whose every syllable, I can tell you, the whole cabinet is united,  Johnson said. Just hours later, though, the man who led the main  leave  campaign in the 2016 referendum on Britain s EU membership told activists at a separate event that there was far too much gloom surrounding Brexit. He then sketched out his own views on how Britain s exit would look and how Britain might need different regulations on everything from data to bioscience.  I campaigned on a slogan of...  Take Back Control .... I think that s what the prime minister also believes in very strongly,  Johnson told the gathering.   If you re going to do this, do it well. Do it in such a way as to get a great result for the UK,  he said.  We want an arrangement that means we are not just locked in strict rotational orbit around the EU.  Johnson, widely regarded in Britain as concealing a fierce political ambition behind a clownish exterior, has overshadowed the party conference which May had hoped to use to claw back some authority after her election gamble went so wrong. Arriving with his trademark blonde hair tousled and rummaging through a suit jacket pocket, Boris enthused Conservative members but was careful to make no explicit pitch to replace May. Ahead of Johnson s speech, May had repeatedly faced questions from reporters about whether she would sack Johnson after he appeared to undermine her Brexit strategy by setting out his own vision. She has sidestepped those questions. The European Parliament savaged the British government s handling of Brexit negotiations on Tuesday, voting against opening talks yet on future trade and condemning disarray in May s team. A German ally of conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel, Manfred Weber, said British cabinet in-fighting was putting a deal at risk and called on May to sack Johnson. But Johnson also provided a rare spark in Manchester where Conservative ministers lined up to cast the opposition Labour Party as dangerous Marxists while failing to offer any striking new policies.  To me, that was real leadership: motivating, inspirational. What s a good leader? It s somebody who can do that,  said Vanessa Churchman a local government official from the Isle of Wight in the south of England.  Everybody who goes away from here will feel inspired.  At previous party conferences, Boris, as he is widely known in Britain, also repeatedly upstaged then-prime minister David Cameron, though after the referendum sank Cameron s career, Johnson dropped out of the race to be leader when a colleague broke a pact to back him. While Johnson is popular with party members, many Conservative lawmakers are angry that he has overshadowed May with what they say were unhelpful and disloyal interventions. May, the staid daughter of a vicar, has a presentational style that is in many ways the polar opposite of Johnson s swashbuckling on-stage persona. She is due to close the conference on Wednesday. ",

        "title": "Islamic State on verge of defeat after fresh losses in Syria, Iraq",
        "text": "BEIRUT/ERBIL (Reuters) - Islamic State s self-proclaimed caliphate was on the verge of final defeat on Friday, with Syrian government forces capturing its last major city on one side of the border and Iraqi forces taking its last substantial town on the other. The losses on either side of the frontier appear to reduce the caliphate that once ruled over millions of people to a single Syrian border town, a village on a bank of the Euphrates in Iraq and some patches of nearby desert. Officials on both sides of the border said its final defeat could come swiftly, although they still fear it will reconstitute as a guerrilla force, capable of waging attacks without territory to defend. Iraq s Prime Minister Haidar Abadi announced that government forces had captured al-Qaim, the border town where the Euphrates spills from Syria into Iraq. That leaves just the village of Rawa further down river on the opposite bank still in the hands of the ultra-hardline militants, who swept through a third of Iraq in 2014. On the Syrian side, government forces declared victory in Deir al-Zor, the last major city in the country s eastern desert where the militants still had a presence. Government forces are now about 40 km away from Albu Kamal, the Syrian town across the border from al-Qaim, and preparing for a final confrontation. A U.S.-led international coalition which has been bombing Islamic State and supporting ground allies on both sides of the frontier said before the fall of al-Qaim that the militant group had just a few thousand fighters left, holed up in the two towns on either side of the border.  We do expect them now to try to flee, but we are cognisant of that and will do all we can to annihilate IS leaders,  spokesman U.S. Colonel Ryan Dillon said.  As IS continues to be hunted into these smallest areas ... we see them fleeing into the desert and hiding there in an attempt to devolve back into an insurgent terrorist group,  said Dillon.  The idea of IS and the virtual caliphate, that will not be defeated in the near term. There is still going to be an IS threat.  The group s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is believed to be hiding in the desert near the frontier. Driven this year from its two de facto capitals   Iraq s Mosul and Syria s Raqqa   Islamic State has been squeezed into an ever-shrinking pocket of desert straddling the frontier by enemies that include most regional states and global powers. In Iraq, it faces the army and Shi ite armed groups, backed both by the U.S.-led international coalition and by Iran. In Syria, the U.S.-led coalition supports an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias north and east of the Euphrates, while Iran and Russia support the government of President Bashar al-Assad. On the Syrian side, Friday s government victory at Deir al-Zor, on the west bank of the Euphrates, ended a two month battle for control over the city, the center of Syria s oil production. Islamic State had for years besieged a government enclave there until an army advance relieved it in early September, starting a battle for jihadist-held parts of the city.  The armed forces, in cooperation with allied forces, liberated the city of Deir al-Zor completely from the clutches of the Daesh terrorist organization,  state media reported, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. Engineering units were searching streets and buildings in Deir al-Zor for mines and booby traps left behind by Islamic State fighters, a Syrian military source told Reuters. The source added that he did not believe the final battle at the Albu Kamal border town would involve  fierce resistance , as many fighters had been surrendering elsewhere.  Some of them will fight until death, but they will not be able to do anything,  he said.  It is besieged from all directions, there are no supplies, a collapse in morale, and therefore all the organization s elements of strength are finished.  Once Albu Kamal falls,  Daesh will be an organization that will cease to exist as a leadership structure,  the military source said.  It will be tantamount to a group of scattered individuals, it will no longer be an organization with headquarters, with leadership places, with areas it controls.  In Iraq, Abadi congratulated his forces for capturing al-Qaim  in record time  only hours after commanders announced they had entered it. Earlier in the day, they seized the border checkpoint on the road to Albu Kamal in Syria. Iraq s joint operations command said the only territory left to capture is Rawa, a small village on the opposite bank of the Euphrates. Iraq has been carrying out its final campaign to crush the Islamic State caliphate while also mounting a military offensive in the north against Kurds who held an independence referendum in September.

        "title": "Text: Trump recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The following is the text of an address made by President Donald Trump announcing the recognition by the United States of Jerusalem as Israel s capital. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. When I came into office, I promised to look at the world s challenges with open eyes and very fresh thinking. We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past. Old challenges demand new approaches. My announcement today marks the beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. In 1995, Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act, urging the federal government to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem and to recognize that that city   and so importantly   is Israel s capital. This act passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago. Yet, for over 20 years, every previous American president has exercised the law s waiver, refusing to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem or to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital city. Presidents issued these waivers under the belief that delaying the recognition of Jerusalem would advance the cause of peace. Some say they lacked courage, but they made their best judgments based on facts as they understood them at the time. Nevertheless, the record is in. After more than two decades of waivers, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result.  Therefore, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.   I ve judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. This is a long-overdue step to advance the peace process and to work towards a lasting agreement. Israel is a sovereign nation with the right like every other sovereign nation to determine its own capital. Acknowledging this as a fact is a necessary condition for achieving peace. It was 70 years ago that the United States, under President Truman, recognized the State of Israel. Ever since then, Israel has made its capital in the city of Jerusalem   the capital the Jewish people established in ancient times. Today, Jerusalem is the seat of the modern Israeli government. It is the home of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, as well as the Israeli Supreme Court. It is the location of the official residence of the Prime Minister and the President. It is the headquarters of many government ministries.  For decades, visiting American presidents, secretaries of state, and military leaders have met their Israeli counterparts in Jerusalem, as I did on my trip to Israel earlier this year. Jerusalem is not just the heart of three great religions, but it is now also the heart of one of the most successful democracies in the world. Over the past seven decades, the Israeli people have built a country where Jews, Muslims, and Christians, and people of all faiths are free to live and worship according to their conscience and according to their beliefs.   Jerusalem is today, and must remain, a place where Jews pray at the Western Wall, where Christians walk the Stations of the Cross, and where Muslims worship at Al-Aqsa Mosque.  However, through all of these years, presidents representing the United States have declined to officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. In fact, we have declined to acknowledge any Israeli capital at all.  But today, we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. This is nothing more, or less, than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It s something that has to be done. That is why, consistent with the Jerusalem Embassy Act, I am also directing the State Department to begin preparation to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  This will immediately begin the process of hiring architects, engineers, and planners, so that a new embassy, when completed, will be a magnificent tribute to peace. In making these announcements, I also want to make one point very clear: This decision is not intended, in any way, to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement. We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians. We are not taking a position of any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders. Those questions are up to the parties involved. The United States remains deeply committed to helping facilitate a peace agreement that is acceptable to both sides.  I intend to do everything in my power to help forge such an agreement. Without question, Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive issues in those talks. The United States would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides. In the meantime, I call on all parties to maintain the status quo at Jerusalem s holy sites, including the Temple Mount, also known as Haram al-Sharif.  Above all, our greatest hope is for peace, the universal yearning in every human soul. With today s action, I reaffirm my administration s longstanding commitment to a future of peace and security for the region.   There will, of course, be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement. But we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a peace and a place far greater in understanding and cooperation. This sacred city should call forth the best in humanity, lifting our sights to what it is possible; not pulling us back and down to the old fights that have become so totally predictable. Peace is never beyond the grasp of those willing to reach. So today, we call for calm, for moderation, and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the purveyors of hate. Our children should inherit our love, not our conflicts.  I repeat the message I delivered at the historic and extraordinary summit in Saudi Arabia earlier this year: The Middle East is a region rich with culture, spirit, and history. Its people are brilliant, proud, and diverse, vibrant and strong. But the incredible future awaiting this region is held at bay by bloodshed, ignorance, and terror.   Vice President Pence will travel to the region in the coming days to reaffirm our commitment to work with partners throughout the Middle East to defeat radicalism that threatens the hopes and dreams of future generations. It is time for the many who desire peace to expel the extremists from their midst. It is time for all civilized nations, and people, to respond to disagreement with reasoned debate  - not violence. And it is time for young and moderate voices all across the Middle East to claim for themselves a bright and beautiful future. So today, let us rededicate ourselves to a path of mutual understanding and respect. Let us rethink old assumptions and open our hearts and minds to possible and possibilities. And finally, I ask the leaders of the region   political and religious; Israeli and Palestinian; Jewish and Christian and Muslim   to join us in the noble quest for lasting peace.  Thank you. God bless you. God bless Israel. God bless the Palestinians. And God bless the United States. Thank you very much.  Thank you.   ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans on Sunday urged President Donald Trump\u2019s new chief of staff John Kelly to rein in the chaos within the White House on Monday but said the retired Marine Corps general will be challenged to assert control. In his first six months in office, Trump has upended White House convention with a loose decision-making style and an open-door policy to his Oval Office for advisers, both internal and external. Infighting among his senior staff has become bitter and public. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to reduce the drama, reduce both the sniping within and reduce the leaks, and bring some discipline to the relationships,\u201d Karl Rove, a Republican strategist and former White House adviser to George W. Bush, said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Trump announced Kelly would replace his embattled chief of staff Reince Priebus at the end of a particularly chaotic week that saw his first legislative effort - healthcare reform - fail in Congress. \u201cHe (Trump) is in a lot of trouble. This week was the most tumultuous week we\u2019ve seen in a tumultuous presidency,\u201d Rove said. On top of the healthcare debacle, Trump came under fire for banning transgender people from the military, and was pilloried for politicizing a speech he made to the Boy Scouts. Adding fuel to the fire, his new communications director Anthony Scaramucci unleashed a string of profane criticism about Priebus and Trump strategist Steven Bannon to a New Yorker magazine reporter. Republicans welcomed Trump\u2019s decision to bring in Kelly, who starts on Monday. \u201cI think he will bring some order and discipline to the West Wing,\u201d said Republican Senator Susan Collins and Trump critic on  NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The last week heightened concerns in Trump\u2019s party that the distractions and West Wing dysfunction would derail other legislative priorities, including tax reform and debt ceiling negotiations. White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said he thought Priebus had been effective \u201cbut was probably a little bit more laid back\u201d in the way he ran the office. \u201cI think the president wants to go in a different direction, wants a little bit more discipline, a little more structure in there,\u201d said Mulvaney, who reports to the chief of staff. It is not yet clear whether all of Trump\u2019s senior staff will answer to Kelly. Some members, including Scaramucci and senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, report directly to Trump, a structure which gives them more power. \u201cI will do whatever the president and our new chief of staff General Kelly ask me to do,\u201d Conway told Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Kelly should be empowered to be the gatekeeper to the Oval Office, said Mike Huckabee, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, whose daughter Sarah Sanders is Trump\u2019s spokeswoman. \u201cThat\u2019s what needs to happen, but that\u2019s going to be up to the president,\u201d Huckabee said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201cThe president has a very different style, he\u2019s very open, the door is open, he invites people to just come on it to a meeting,\u201d Huckabee said. To be effective, Kelly needs to find a way to work within Trump\u2019s untraditional style, said Corey Lewandowski, who was a former campaign manager to Trump, and remains close to the president. \u201cThe thing that General Kelly should do is not try to change Donald Trump,\u201d Lewandowski said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cAnybody who thinks they\u2019re going to change Donald Trump doesn\u2019t know Donald Trump,\u201d Lewandowski said.

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump returned to his hometown on Thursday for the first time since taking office, as many New Yorkers took to the streets to protest the politics of the man who built his name and fortune in the city. The presidential motorcade passed hundreds of demonstrators as it arrived at the decommissioned aircraft carrier Intrepid in the early evening for a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull hours after it was originally scheduled.  Before leaving Washington, Trump held a hastily arranged White House celebration with fellow Republicans from the U.S. House of Representatives who narrowly passed a healthcare bill that would repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. [nL1N1I61UA] If anything, Trump\u2019s role in efforts to scrap the signature domestic achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, further incensed the protesters. Among those on the street were members of the New York State Nurses Association, who chanted: \u201cWhat do we want? Health care! When do we want it? Now!\u201d  Demonstrators from the Working Families Party spent much of the afternoon rallying and marching near the Intrepid, now a floating museum on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, banging pans, chanting: \u201cNot my president\u201d and carrying signs including one that read: \u201cThis village doesn\u2019t want its idiot back!\u201d Rob Adkins, 33, a professional musician from Brooklyn who is insured through Obamacare, said he was alarmed by the Trump-backed Republican healthcare plan that passed the House. \u201cIt could cost me my health insurance,\u201d he said, echoing the sentiments of several other protesters. The demonstrations, which included other groups throughout Manhattan, were reminiscent of the weeks after Trump\u2019s Nov. 8 election when frequent protests took place outside his home in the Fifth Avenue tower that bears his name.    The first 100 days since the Jan. 20 inauguration of the businessman-turned-politician brought rollbacks of environmental regulations and crackdowns on immigrants, none of which play well in the liberal Northeast city. Fewer than one in five residents in the United States\u2019 most populous city voted for Trump, even though he comes from its Queens borough, built a real estate brand and other ventures associated with New York, and has been fodder for its tabloid newspapers for decades. Providing security for first lady Melania Trump, who has continued to live in Trump Tower while their 11-year-old son Barron finishes the school year, has been a costly obligation for New York.  After security costs for Trump and his family of about $24 million during the transition and $300,000 a day since then, Congress voted last week to reimburse the city and other local governments for $61 million. Following the events with Turnbull, which include a black-tie dinner on the Intrepid to mark the 75th anniversary of World War Two\u2019s Battle of the Coral Sea, Trump was expected to go to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for the weekend.

        "text": "SREBRENICA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Almir Salihovic sits in his office in Srebrenica, waiting for a U.N. tribunal to give its judgment on the man accused of massacring his cousins and uncles there in 1995. He is hoping for a measure of justice, but little else. The businessman was 10 when he fled through the woods with his father and brother as Bosnian Serb soldiers opened fire behind them. The troops killed more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the days that followed.  Next week the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia will give its verdict on Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb general accused of overseeing the murders and other war crimes, including the siege of Sarajevo. A guilty verdict on Nov. 22 would give some  personal satisfaction to victims,  Salihovic told Reuters at his transportation company in the eastern town, where his family returned in 2004.  But it would do little else - certainly nothing to heal the deeper traumas and still gaping divides.  For most Serbs he will remain a hero, for others he will be the butcher and criminal, and we will continue to live in our folds, side by side, not together,  he said.   We carry the burden of a terrible crime that puts inter-ethnic relations under pressure.     The legacy of a commander who led the Bosnian Serb army in its swift takeover of two-thirds of the country during the 1992-95 war still divides Muslim Bosniaks and Serbs in Bosnia. For Srebrenica Muslims, Mladic is a symbol of the chaos and killings that broke out when his forces took over the U.N-protected eastern enclave where about 40,000 Muslims from eastern Bosnia had sought refuge.  For Serbs the 74-year-old is a proud general who won the territory with very few of his own casualties. Srebrenica s own Serb mayor Mladen Grujicic says the killings did not amount to genocide - and the two international courts who ruled that they did were biased against his fellow Serbs.  It will take many more years to reveal the complete truth, which is not favoring any side,  Grujicic told Reuters.   We in both communities are victims while higher agendas are at stake,  he added, without elaborating. Srebrenica is now a shrinking town where about 7,000 Muslim Bosniaks and Serbs still live side by side, suspicious of each other and divided by the past.  One thing they do share is their poverty. The town is dotted with empty houses, left behind by people seeking a better life. This year the only bakery and butchers shop had to close down. Srebrenica was once known for its metal plant and nearby lead, zinc and gold mines. These days, the main landmark is the cemetery on its outskirts and the 6,575 white tombstones marking the remains of the victims that authorities have managed to find.  In 2010, I buried my children and husband. Nobody should go through it ever again. Now I live alone, and I should not have had to live alone if it was not for some hotheads,  said Hatidza Mehmedovic. The 66-year-old comes every day to tend the graves of her husband and two sons killed in what is widely seen as Europe s worst atrocity since the World War Two.  This is not life, this is hell, this is a life of punishment,  Mehmedovic told Reuters.  Further southwest, in Mladic s home village of Bozanovici, his cousins are also waiting for the tribunal s verdict. They fear he will be jailed for crimes they say he did not commit.  I would be happiest if he died before the judgment,  his uncle Mile Mladic told Reuters.   We would then raise a large monument for him in the village and write the truth. All this that is happening is not the truth. It is a lie. The general is not guilty.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged Congress on Wednesday to raise the federal debt limit before lawmakers start  their August recess, to avoid higher interest costs to taxpayers and market uncertainty about a potential default. Maintaining U.S. creditworthiness is of the \u201cutmost importance\u201d and the United States must pay its bills on time, Mnuchin told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee. \u201cAs I\u2019ve suggested in the past, based upon our best estimate at the time, we do have funding through September, but I have urged Congress to take this up before they leave for the recess,\u201d Mnuchin said. However there was little sign Congress would heed Mnuchin\u2019s call, at least for the moment. The House of Representatives is due to start its recess on Friday with no hint of movement on the issue, while the Senate is consumed with trying to pass a healthcare overhaul bill. That could leave the debt limit unaddressed until Congress returns on Sept. 5, perhaps one month before the Treasury runs a real risk of not being able to pay all of its obligations.   The last extension of the federal borrowing limit expired in March with total debt of around $20 trillion, but the Treasury has extended its ability to issue debt by employing extraordinary cash management measures, including deferring reinvestments in federal employee pension funds. But short-term Treasury bill markets have grown nervous about the potential for the Treasury to exhaust its borrowing capacity by mid-October, sending yields higher and crushing demand for a recent 3-month bill auction. The situation is costing taxpayers money and stoking market uncertainty, said Mnuchin, a former banker and Hollywood film financier.  \u201cRight now effectively, as opposed to borrowing in the market at lower rates, we\u2019re borrowing and making our trust funds whole at slightly higher rates, so there is a real cost to doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s also an implied cost of uncertainty into the market. And the longer we wait, that more that uncertainty will be.\u201d Senator James Lankford, a Republican, said at the hearing that his best estimate, derived through working with Treasury officials, was that the use of extraordinary measures would amount to about $2.5 billion, largely because the government would have to cover interest owed to the affected pension funds. Mnuchin did not dispute that estimate. Lawmakers showed varying levels of concern on Capitol Hill this week as the Senate focused on trying to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. \u201cRight now, my focus is Obamacare,\u201d said Senator Ted Cruz when asked on Tuesday if the lack of action on the debt limit was a concern. Cruz led fellow Republicans in 2013 to demand spending cuts as part of a fiscal fight that led to a 16-day partial government shutdown. Another fiscal conservative senator, David Perdue, said however he would prefer that Congress stay in session in August to deal with raising the debt ceiling, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to get it done.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to pass a debt ceiling increase but does not have timing nailed down, a spokesman said.

        "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italy s lower house of parliament on Thursday approved a new electoral law for use in the next national election, due by May 2018. The bill now passes to the upper house for further debate. Here are the main points of the bill. Italy gives Latin names to its electoral laws. This new proposal is called the Rosatellum, named after Ettore Rosato, the parliamentary party leader of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) who helped draft the legislation. The bill envisages that some 36 percent of parliamentarians in both the upper and lower houses will be elected on a first-past-the-post basis, with the rest chosen by pure proportional representation via party lists.  Parties can stand alone or as part of broader coalitions. Single parties need to win at least 3 percent of the vote to gain seats, while coalitions need to take 10 percent.  Unlike the previous Italian electoral law, the Rosatellum does not give an automatic majority to any party or group that wins more than 40 percent of the vote. With opinion polls split three ways between the center-right, the center-left and the maverick 5-Star Movement, there is unlikely to be a clearcut winner in the next election. Voters get two voting slips   one for the Senate and one for the lower house. They can only put one cross on each slip, with that vote counted for both the first-past-the-post and PR segments. Under previous electoral systems, voters were able to split their vote between individual candidates and the parties. Candidates can put their name down for the first-past-the-post ballot in one constituency, and also be on five PR lists in locations of their choosing. There will be two to four names on each party PR list. The party leaders will have a major say in whose names go on the lists.  In the lower house, 232 seats will be reserved for first-past-the-post winners, 386 will be reserved for the PR lists, and 12 will be reserved for overseas constituencies. In the Senate, 102 seats will go to first-past-the-post winners, 207 will go to the PR lists, and 6 will be for the overseas vote. No more than 60 percent of the candidates on any of the lists can be of the same sex. ",

At their meeting last month, the pope gave U.S. President Donald Trump a signed copy of his 2015 encyclical letter that called for protecting the environment from the effects of climate change and backed scientific evidence that it is caused by human activity. Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin urged Trump in a separate meeting not to quit the Paris accord. \u201cIf he really does (pull out), it would be a huge slap in the face for us,\u201d said Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, which has hosted numerous international conferences on climate change. \u201cIt will be a disaster for everyone,\u201d he told the Rome newspaper La Repubblica. In a telephone call with Reuters, Sanchez Sorondo confirmed the comments in the newspaper. Trump was due to announce his decision later on Thursday. A source briefed on the decision has told Reuters in Washington that he will follow through on his campaign pledge to pull the United States out of the global agreement. The accord, agreed on by nearly 200 countries in 2015, aims to cut emissions blamed for global warming. The United States committed to reducing its own by 26 to 28 percent, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. Sanchez Sorondo said he believed the U.S. oil lobby was behind the decision and that the industry had \u201cmaneuvered\u201d Trump.  A withdrawal \u201cwould not only be a disaster but completely unscientific,\u201d he said. \u201cSaying that we need to rely on coal and oil is like saying that the earth is not round. It is an absurdity dictated by the need to make money.\u201d  Trump has called the idea of global warming a hoax. In  March, Cardinal Peter Turkson, the pope\u2019s point man for the environment, immigration and development, urged Trump to listen to \u201cdissenting voices\u201d and reconsider his position on climate change. Former U.S. President Barack Obama helped broker the Paris accord and praised it during a trip to Europe this month.

        "text": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya will not face a constitutional or political crisis even if a planned re-run of its presidential election, now set for Oct. 26, is delayed beyond the end of October, the attorney general said on Friday. The Supreme Court this month annulled President Uhuru Kenyatta s August 8 election win, citing irregularities, and ordered the election board to organize a new poll by the end of October. Kenyatta is expected to face off again with opposition leader Raila Odinga. Odinga s lead lawyer in a petition that led to the invalidation of Kenyatta s re-election, James Orengo, said on Wednesday that if the election were not held by the end of October, Kenyatta s term in office would cease, thrusting the country into a deep constitutional crisis.  The government now in office legitimately remains in office by full force of the constitution until the fresh election is complete and the new leader sworn in , Githu Muigai, the attorney general, told a news conference.  (Any delay in poll) does not delegitimize the constitutional order of the day... There is absolutely no chance of a crisis around the date because the election did take place and... we are again inside the election cycle,  he added. Odinga s NASA coalition said it believed Kenyatta s term would end 60 days after the Supreme Court ruling on Sept. 1 that nullified the August election. Odinga has said he will not take part in the election if certain conditions are not met, including the removal of some election board officials. Moses Wetangula, one of NASA s leaders, accused Muigai of misreading the constitution.  He s simply being mischievous,  Wetangula told a news conference also addressed by Odinga on Friday.  Kenya has the region s richest economy and is a key Western ally in a region often shaken by violence. The repeat election is being closely watched for signs of tension that could spark violence as in 2007 when more than 1,000 Kenyans were killed. This week Kenyatta accused the Supreme Court of staging a  coup  against the will of the people when it annulled his win, in a sign that the political rhetoric is heating up ahead of the new poll.    Odinga accused Kenyatta of dragging Kenya down the path of other African states that have suffered upheaval over elections, including Gambia. He added the opposition had lost hope that Kenyatta would  sober up, mature and see the need to stop . On Thursday the election board pushed back the date of the election re-run to Oct. 26 after a French firm whose technology is being used in the polls said it was nearly impossible to be ready for the originally scheduled date of Oct. 17.

The comprehensive new economic partnership we seek will underpin our shared commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of those who seek to undermine them.   The British government is playing one its strongest cards in the Brexit negotiations by offering to put its defense and security assets at the disposal of the EU in the hope of winning concessions on future trading and economic relations. The country has bigger defense budgets than any other EU member state and its diplomatic and intelligence services are among the most extensive in Europe. Its government also argues it is one of the leading EU contributors to a range of security measures, such as data and evidence sharing, extradition measures and to the EU s police agency Europol. May on Monday accused Russia of fomenting violence in eastern Ukraine, of repeatedly violating the national airspace of several European countries, and mounting a campaign of cyber attacks. She also accused Russia of meddling in elections and hacking the Danish defense ministry, the German parliament and its state-media of planting fake stories and photo-shopped images in an attempt to undermine western institutions.

        "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Edinson Cavani silenced his critics when he scored four goals in Paris St Germain\u2019s 6-0 victory at Caen in Ligue 1 on Friday.     The Uruguay striker, who wasted a handful of chances in the French champions\u2019 1-1 home draw against Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday, found the back of the net four times before the break in a one-sided encounter.     The result meant that PSG, who had bagged only one point from their last two league encounters, move to the top of the standings with 10 points from five games.    Monaco, Girondins de Bordeaux and Nice, among others, could take over at the top depending on Saturday\u2019s results.    Cavani opened the scoring after 12 minutes when he latched onto a Maxwell cross from the left and doubled the tally from the penalty spot after Syam Ben Youssef fouled Lucas in the box.

        "text": "ALBANY, N.Y. (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday presented a $145.3 billion budget that keeps operating funds growth at 1.7 percent for a sixth year, while promising an infrastructure development plan that he said will be the largest in the state\u2019s history. Cuomo, a Democrat, outlined his budget in his sixth annual state of the state address in New York\u2019s capital, Albany. It was a wide-ranging speech designed to portray Cuomo as a governor of big ideas, touching on topics including the minimum wage, prison reform, counter terrorism and paid maternity leave. Cuomo has consistently presented himself as a responsible steward of the state\u2019s finances, capping spending growth at 2 percent or under. When he took office in 2011 he inherited a budget deficit of $10 billion and a state known for fiscal dysfunction. He has tied his governorship to big infrastructure projects and has spent the new year touring the state, promising a program to equip New York for the next 100 years. Wednesday\u2019s speech was no exception. Cuomo, who has been cited as a possible presidential candidate beyond 2016, presented himself as an alternative to the gridlock in Washington D.C. \u201cThis nation has real problems that we haven\u2019t seen before and with the gridlock in Washington I am not going to rely on them to solve them,\u201d Cuomo told a packed convention center in the address that lasted for over an hour and half. Cuomo\u2019s infrastructure plans include rebuilding New York City\u2019s Pennsylvania Station for $3 billion, expanding rail services to Long Island by adding a third track for $1 billion and a $1 billion extension to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City. He has also promised $22 billion for upstate transport over the next five years. The funds, which will primarily go to repairing roads and bridges, are aimed at creating parity between upstate and downstate spending on transport, Cuomo said. Cuomo also tried to draw a line under a difficult year for Albany after speakers of the Assembly and Senate were convicted on corruption charges. He proposed measure to close a loop hole allowing some companies to skirt limits on political donations. A cloud of suspicion was removed from Cuomo this week after the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan said there was \u201cinsufficient\u201d evidence to prove any crimes occurred when the governor prematurely disbanded an anti-corruption panel.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand fired back at President Donald Trump on Tuesday and said she would not be silenced after he attacked her on Twitter for calling for an investigation into accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct against him. Six U.S. senators, including Gillibrand, have said Trump should resign.  Trump lambasted Gillibrand on Twitter on Tuesday writing, \u201cLightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office \u2018begging\u2019 for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump.\u201d Schumer is the Senate Democratic leader. Gillibrand, whose name has been floated as a possible Democratic presidential candidate in 2020, said she would not back down.  \u201cIt was a sexist smear attempting to silence my voice, and I will not be silenced on this issue,\u201d she told reporters at a news conference. Trump did not answer a reporter\u2019s question at a White House event later on Tuesday when asked what he meant by the tweet. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, told that some people thought Trump\u2019s tweet contained sexual innuendo, said, \u201cOnly if your mind is in the gutter would you have read it that way ... it\u2019s obviously talking about political partisan games that people often play and the broken system.\u201d Sanders told a regular White House briefing that Trump had used similar language previously to refer to men of both major parties.       Other Democratic lawmakers rallied behind Gillibrand, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, another possible 2020 presidential candidate.  In a tweet directed at Trump, Warren wrote on Tuesday, \u201cAre you really trying to bully, intimidate and slut-shame @SenGillibrand? Do you know who you\u2019re picking a fight with? Good luck with that, @realDonaldTrump. Nevertheless, #shepersisted.\u201d U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump\u2019s  attack on Gillibrand was \u201cnasty, unbecoming of a president,\u201d but he did not join her call for Trump to resign the presidency over sexual misconduct accusations. More than a dozen women have accused Trump, a New York-based real estate developer and former reality television star, of making unwanted sexual advances against them years before he entered politics. Trump, a Republican, has denied the allegations.     Reuters has not independently verified the accusations against Trump.  Interest in accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct came to the fore again on Monday when three women who had previously accused Trump of misconduct called on the U.S. Congress to investigate his behavior.  On Tuesday, a fourth woman who had also previously made similar accusations backed their call for an investigation during an interview with NBC. Nearly 60 female Democratic U.S. lawmakers called for an investigation in a letter on Monday. By Tuesday, the group said many male colleagues had also joined on, bringing the number to more than 100 lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives. Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, responded to the group in a letter on Tuesday that said, \u201cThe specific allegations set forth in your letter constitute crimes,\u201d both federal and state. Gowdy noted that congressional panels cannot prosecute crimes so he was forwarding the group\u2019s letter to the Justice Department. He added that any charges not alleging crimes should go to the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over \u201callegations related to fitness for office and non-criminal matters.\u201d   Trump has called the accusations fabricated stories and he has said he did not know his accusers.  On Monday, Gillibrand called the allegations credible and called on Trump to resign over them.  The attention to sexual harassment accusations against Trump comes amid a wave of similar accusations against prominent men in Hollywood, the media and politics in recent months. Federal Election Commission records showed Trump gave $4,800 to Gillibrand\u2019s Senate campaign in 2010, and that he donated $2,100 to her in 2007 while she was a member of the House of Representatives. Concerns over sexual impropriety have become a political issue the United States, leading to the resignations of two Democratic and one Republican lawmaker. Reuters has not independently verified accusations against them.  The issue of sexual harassment has also become central to Tuesday\u2019s U.S. Senate election in Alabama after accusations of misconduct were made against Republican candidate Roy Moore.    The White House said on Monday that the women\u2019s accusations against Trump were false and \u201ctotally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts\u201d and later promised to provide a list of those accounts to reporters.  On Tuesday, the White house sent a list of three 2016 media reports, including a New York Post interview with a British man who disputed one of the accusers\u2019 accounts of alleged groping and said he never saw it happen. It also included New York Daily News and CNN reports with two other former pageant participants supporting Trump. ",

        "title": "Eurosceptics baulk as May pitches status quo Brexit transition",
        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May told parliament her plan on Monday for a Brexit transition period with broadly the same access to European Union markets but was met with scepticism from pro-Brexit lawmakers fearful of a watered-down EU exit. May secured an agreement with EU leaders last week to move previously-deadlocked talks forward onto the topic of interim and long-term trading arrangements. On Monday, she reported back to parliament on those talks, setting out the framework of a roughly two-year implementation period designed to smooth Britain s EU exit and provide clarity for businesses and citizens.   This will help give certainty to employers and families that we are going to deliver a smooth Brexit,  May said. She added that negotiating guidelines agreed last week point to a shared desire with the EU to make  rapid progress  on a deal. The outline of the transition period that May presented is consistent with plans she has previously set out and largely in line with what Brussels wants, but remains subject to negotiation.  During this strictly time-limited implementation period which we will now begin to negotiate, we would not be in the single market or the customs union, as we will have left the European Union,  May said.   But we would propose that our access to one another s markets would continue as now, while we prepare and implement the new processes and new systems that will underpin our future partnership.  May said during the interim period, Britain wants to begin registering the arrival of EU citizens in the country in preparation for a new immigration system, and would hope to agree, and even sign, trade deals with non-EU states. But the plan was not universally accepted by lawmakers in May s Conservative Party, which is deeply divided over the best route out of the bloc. Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of several pro-Brexit Conservatives to express concern, called on May to reject the EU s negotiating guidelines because they would make Britain  no more than a vassal state, a colony, a serf of the European Union.    May is reliant on the backing of all members of her party to put her Brexit plans into action, having lost her parliamentary majority in an ill-judged snap election earlier this year which left her needing the support of a small Northern Irish party.   Last week May s fragility was exposed by the rebellion of 11 largely pro-European Conservative lawmakers in a parliamentary vote on Brexit legislation that led to an embarrassing defeat. The rebels have since drawn harsh criticism from some party members, and received threats of violence online.  We are dealing with questions of great significance to our country s future, so it is natural that there are many strongly held views on all sides of this chamber,  May said.   But there can never be a place for the threats of violence and intimidation against some members that we have seen in recent days.  Earlier on Monday, May met key ministers to discuss the even thornier issue of what the country s long-term relationship with the EU should be - the first time since the June 2016 vote to leave that she has broached the topic with cabinet members. A full cabinet discussion on the so-called  end state  of the Brexit talks is then due on Tuesday. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. intelligence officials will testify before a Senate panel next week on the law governing the collection of foreign intelligence, parts of which are due to expire at the end of the year, the Senate Intelligence Committee said on Friday.  Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers and Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will appear before the committee in both open public and closed-door hearings on Wednesday to discuss the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, the committee said in a statement.  The next day, former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by President Donald Trump last month, is scheduled to testify before the same committee.  Comey had been overseeing an FBI investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between Moscow and Trump associates, and the Senate panel is conducting a parallel probe. A part of FISA known as Section 702 will expire on Dec. 31 unless Congress votes to reauthorize it. The statute allows the NSA to collect digital communications of foreigners believed to be living overseas whose communications pass through American phone or internet providers. For technical reasons, it also incidentally collects data on Americans, a practice that privacy advocates have said evades Constitutional protections against warrantless searches. FISA and U.S. surveillance practices have come under increased scrutiny in recent months amid unsubstantiated assertions by President Donald Trump and other Republicans that the White House under former President Barack Obama improperly spied on Trump or his associates.  A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in the House of Representatives is working on legislation that would renew Section 702 but with additional transparency and oversight, among other changes, though it remains unclear if it would have enough support to pass Congress and be signed by Trump. A White House official told Reuters in March the administration supported the law\u2019s renewal and did not want to alter it. ",

        "text": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Lawyers for Jacob Zuma have until midnight to file papers outlining why nearly 800 corruption charges shelved before he became South African president eight years ago but recently reinstated by the courts should not be brought against him. The revival of the charges could increase pressure on Zuma to step down before his term ends in 2019 and diminish his influence over who succeeds him when the ruling African National Congress (ANC) chooses a new leader in December.     The 75-year-old president has faced and denied numerous other corruption allegations since taking office in 2009.  The 783 charges, which relate to a 30 billion rand ($2.2 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s, were filed but then dropped by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) shortly before he ran for the presidency. South Africa s High Court reinstated the charges last year and the Supreme Court upheld that decision in October, rejecting an appeal by Zuma and describing the NPA s decision to set aside the charges as  irrational . The NPA said then that Zuma had until Nov. 30 to make submissions before it decided whether to pursue the charges. Spokesmen for the NPA and Zuma were not available for comment on Thursday. Last month s Supreme Court ruling lifted the rand currency against the dollar as investors bet that Zuma s removal may be inching closer. The president is unpopular with many investors after sacking respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan in March, a move that hit South African financial assets and helped tip the country s credit ratings into  junk  territory. Infighting within the ruling ANC ahead of next month s conference to elect a successor to Zuma as party chief has also sapped confidence among the investors upon whom South Africa relies to finance its hefty budget and current account deficits. One of South Africa s leading universities, the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) in Johannesburg, said on Thursday that it had appointed Gordhan as a visiting professor.  He will join other ANC heavyweights who have ended up at the Wits after being sidelined by Zuma, among them another respected and ousted finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene, and former Reserve Bank Governor Tito Mboweni. Widely seen as a competent and honest technocrat, Gordhan has become an unlikely poster boy for public anger at the president, whose administration has been marred by missteps and allegations of corruption.

        "text": "KIRKUK, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq s oil-producing region of Kirkuk will vote in a referendum on Kurdish independence on Sept. 25, its provisional council decided on Tuesday, a move that could increase tension with Arab and Turkmen residents. The ethnically mixed region is claimed by both the central government in Baghdad and the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq. The vote is  definitely happening  on Sept. 25, Kirkuk Governor Najmuddin Kareem told Reuters after a majority of the provincial council voted in favor of taking part. Only 24 of the 41 council members attended Tuesday s vote, with 23 voting in favor of participating in the referendum. One abstained.  The remaining council members - all Arabs and Turkmen - boycotted the vote. Instead, they issued statements denouncing the vote as  unconstitutional.  The KRG had said it was up to the local councils of Kirkuk and three other disputed regions of Iraq to decide whether to join the vote on the independence of the Kurdish region. The vote in the disputed regions would amount to deciding whether to join the KRG or remain under the jurisdiction of the Shi ite Arab-led government in Baghdad. Baghdad says the referendum is unconstitutional. Speaking to reporters following a meeting of his council of ministers, Iraqi Prime Minister Hayder al-Abadi denounced Tuesday s decision as  wrong .   Issues are not handled like this,  he added. Sunni MP Mohammed al-Karbouli told Reuters that Tuesday s decision  would help trigger ethnic fighting  in the region and would also  extend the life  of Islamic State in the country.  It s a stark violation of the constitution and a determined move to confiscate the rights of the Arab and Turkmen in Kirkuk. The government should intervene to stop this violation,  al-Karbouli said. The United States and Western nations fear the vote could lead to conflicts with Baghdad and neighboring Turkey and Iran, which host sizeable Kurdish populations, diverting attention from the fight against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. A senior Kurdish official has said Iraq s Kurds might consider postponing the referendum in return for financial and political concessions from the central government.  Those who ask for a postponement - including Baghdad and the U.S. and Europe and whoever - should give us a time,  Kareem said.  Why don t they propose a date?  Kurdish peshmerga fighters seized control of Kirkuk in 2014 when the Iraqi army fled from Islamic State s offensive across northern and western Iraq, preventing the region s oil fields from falling into the hands of the militants. The Kurds have been seeking an independent state since at least the end of World War One, when colonial powers divided up the Middle East and left Kurdish-populated territory split between modern-day Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie top Donald Trump\u2019s short list to be his vice presidential running mate, sources said, but the candidate is casting a wide net that also includes several U.S. senators and other governors. With less than three weeks to go until his formal nomination at the Republican National Convention as the party\u2019s candidate in the Nov. 8 election, Trump\u2019s search for a No. 2 has intensified. The wealthy businessman, a political neophyte, has said he wants a political veteran to help him navigate the power corridors of Washington.Gingrich and Christie, both loyal to Trump at a time when many Republican colleagues want nothing to do with him, would meet his requirement for experience - but would come with minuses as well as pluses. Other names to watch include U.S. Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Governors Mike Pence of Indiana and Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, Republicans close to the campaign said this week.     Trump has set up a meeting with Pence this weekend, a spokesman for the governor said on Friday. The New Yorker has also met with Corker and Fallin. \u201cMr. Trump is meeting with a number of Republican leaders in the run-up to the convention in Cleveland, and he has a good relationship with Gov. Pence,\u201d Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in an email response to a question from Reuters. An experienced running mate also could help with fundraising. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, raised more than $40 million for her campaign in June and about $28 million for her party. Trump, who largely self-funded his primary run, has not yet released June fundraising numbers.  Trump is expected to name his running mate close to the July 18-21 convention.  Gingrich, who was speaker of the House of Representatives in the 1990s and ran for president in 2012, is a popular conservative writer and speaker, and has been an important behind-the-scenes voice in urging Trump to adopt a more presidential demeanor. But because Trump is 70 and Gingrich is 73, they could face difficulty appealing to a younger generation. Christie quickly endorsed Trump after quitting the race early this year. A source said the 53-year-old governor has emerged as a key adviser to Trump and his campaign team. A source said Christie was instrumental in coaxing Trump to be less confrontational with a Mexican-American federal judge overseeing a fraud case involving Trump. One clue to Christie\u2019s rising importance came earlier this week when some campaign supporters held a conference call to discuss strategy and talking points for media appearances. A source said that during the call Christie\u2019s name was raised as someone who might comment on former President Bill Clinton\u2019s meeting earlier this week with Attorney General Loretta Lynch. As a former federal prosecutor, Christie would be a credible voice.  Monday night\u2019s private meeting of Clinton and Lynch, the top U.S. law enforcement officer, has been criticized because Hillary Clinton is under federal investigation for using a private email server when she was Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state. The source said campaign associates made clear Christie was not to be used for this purpose. \u201cThey\u2019re saving him for the general election,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to overexpose him.\u201d Still, many Republicans are waiting to see whether Christie is named as an unindicted co-conspirator in a 2014 case involving charges that lanes on the George Washington Bridge were closed in New Jersey for political reasons. Corker, 63, offers Trump deep foreign policy experience as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and, like Trump, believes the Republican Party needs shaking up. His stock may have gone down, however, because he has not hesitated to criticize the candidate at times. Ernst, a first-term senator and military veteran, could help improve Trump\u2019s standing with women. She tacitly supported rival Marco Rubio during the Republican nominating campaign, though she has promised to support the party\u2019s nominee. Ernst, who turned 46 on Friday, said earlier this month that the Trump campaign had not contacted her. The same goes for Oklahoma\u2019s Fallin, who was among several Republican governors who met jointly with Trump in June. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be mentioned for the office of vice president. I have not had any conversation with Mr. Trump about the vice presidency,\u201d Fallin, 61, said in a statement. Some Republicans could be considered even if they have not had recent contact with the campaign.

        "title": "Main Cambodian opposition leader arrested, paper shuts as crackdown grows",
        "text": "PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia s main opposition leader Kem Sokha was arrested and accused of treason on Sunday and a leading independent paper said it was being forced to shut down as Prime Minister Hun Sen s government intensified a crackdown on his critics. Hun Sen said Kem Sokha had been plotting with the United States, increasing his anti-American rhetoric as Cambodia heads towards elections next year in which the authoritarian leader s grip of more than three decades is at stake. The U.S. State Department expressed concern at the arrest of Ken Sokha and action against the media. It raised doubt over whether the Southeast Asian country can hold a fair election. Hun Sen, 65, a former Khmer Rouge cadre, who is now one of China s closest regional allies, said Kem Sokha had been arrested for treason in which the United States was implicated.  It s an act of treason with conspiracy with a foreign country, betraying his own nation. This requires arrest,  Hun Sen told a group of garment workers, according to the pro-government Fresh News website. Kem Sokha, 64, has led the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) since his predecessor resigned in February, saying he feared a government plan to shut it down. Kem Sokha was taken from his home in handcuffs after a night-time police raid. The opposition party lost to Hun Sen s Cambodian People s Party in local elections in June, but it did well enough to increase expectations of a close contest in the 2018 vote. The government released a video on its Facebook page in which Kem Sokha appeared to tell a group of supporters about a strategy to win power which he said had the support of  the Americans  rather than an immediate plot to topple Hun Sen. In the video, Kem Sokha said the Americans had hired academics to advise on strategy to change Cambodia s leaders.  And if I follow such a tactic and strategy and if I could not win, I do not know what else to do,  he said. The opposition party made no immediate comment on the veracity or content of the video. Earlier, it said Kem Sokha s arrest was politically motivated and violated the law because of the immunity granted to elected lawmakers. The party called for his release and urged the international community to intervene. If Kem Sokha is found guilty of any offence, it could allow the government to shut the party under a new law. Kem Sokha made no immediate comment and it was not clear if he had been charged or had legal representation at this stage. The government has stepped up attacks on the United States and last month ordered the expulsion of the U.S. State Department-funded National Democratic Institute pro-democracy group. Earlier in the year, it suspended joint military exercises with the United States, which has voiced fears over the human rights situation. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the charges against Kem Sokha appeared to be politically motivated. Her statement did not directly address Hun Sen s accusations against the United States. Nauert also highlighted recent steps by the Cambodian government against independent media and civil society, saying they  raise serious questions about the government s ability to organize credible national elections in 2018 which produce an outcome that enjoys democratic legitimacy . In a sign of the pressure on the media, The Cambodia Daily said it was ceasing publication after the government ordered it to pay a crippling $6.3 million tax bill by Monday. The English-language paper, founded by an American journalist, was known for critical coverage of issues such as corruption, human rights and the environment.  After 24 years and 15 days, the Cambodian government has destroyed The Cambodia Daily, a special and singular part of Cambodia s free press,  it said in a statement. During Hun Sen s rule Cambodia emerged from the devastating Khmer Rouge genocide to enjoy record years of economic growth of  above 7 percent, but disaffection has been increasing and he only just won the 2013 election against a unified opposition.

        "text": "KABUL (Reuters) - Taliban militants struck government targets in many provinces of Afghanistan on Tuesday, killing at least 69 people, including a senior police commander, and wounding scores of others. The deadliest attack hit a police training centre attached to the police headquarters in Gardez, main city of Paktia province. Two Taliban suicide car bombers paved the way for a number of gunmen to attack the compound, officials and militants said. At least 21 police officers were killed, including the Paktia provincial police chief, with 48 others wounded, according to government officials. The attack also left at least 20 civilians dead and 110 wounded, the Interior Ministry said. Security forces killed at least five attackers. Dozens of dead and wounded were taken to the city hospital, even as many more lay where they fell during the fighting, deputy public health director Hedayatullah Hameedi said. The Taliban, seeking to reimpose strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster by U.S.-led forces, claimed responsibility. The militant group also attacked a district centre in neighbouring Ghazni province on Tuesday, detonating an armoured Humvee vehicles packed with explosives near the provincial governor s office. Provincial officials said at least 15 government security forces were killed and 12 wounded in the Ghazni attacks, with 13 civilians killed and seven wounded. The Taliban said they had killed 31 security forces and wounded 21 in those clashes. Fighting was also reported near local government centres in Farah and Kandahar provinces. ",

        "title": "Trump's low approval rating masks his support among likely voters: Reuters/Ipsos poll",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is more popular with likely voters than he is with the general public, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that underscores why Republican lawmakers have largely stuck with the polarizing president despite his plunging approval ratings. The poll, released on Wednesday, shows he polls better among people who voted in the 2016 presidential election than with the overall U.S. adult population \u2013 a group that includes both voters and non-voters. Only about 60 percent of the voting-age public took part in last year\u2019s election. In October, for example, 44 percent of 2016 voters said they approved of Trump\u2019s performance in office, compared with 37 percent of the general population. Among Republicans, 82 percent of voters approved of Trump in October, compared with 75 percent of all Republicans. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2zoIC1A) Some 85 percent of those who voted for Trump in 2016 said they would do so again, the poll found. The findings suggest that Republican candidates in the 2018 congressional elections who shun the president risk alienating his followers, Republican strategists and political scientists said. At the same time, those who embrace him in the early primary races that choose party candidates risk losing moderate voters in the general election. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for any Republican candidate to distance themselves from Trump,\u201d said Michael McDonald, an expert on voter turnout at the University of Florida.  That dilemma played out in Virginia on Tuesday, when Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate in the governor\u2019s race, was soundly beaten by his Democratic opponent. Gillespie had adopted some of Trump\u2019s hardline positions but had avoided campaigning with the unpopular president.  Gillespie\u2019s strategy had been closely watched within the party to see if it could provide a template for other Republican candidates in 2018, when control of the House of Representatives and the Senate will be up for grabs. Gillespie\u2019s loss sparked debate among Republicans on the way forward on Wednesday. Trump suggested in a tweet that the outcome could have been different had Gillespie fully embraced him, but critics pointed out that exit polls showed that a third of Virginian voters had turned out to signal displeasure with Trump, double the number who cast ballots to express support for the president.  Tuesday\u2019s results clearly signal that opposition to Trump has grown, even though he remains popular among 2016 Republican voters, said Elaine Kamarck, an expert in presidential politics at the Brookings Institution.  For Republicans, \u201cthe hurdle won\u2019t be with getting out the base,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cIt will be in getting anyone else to vote for you\u201d in elections where Republican voters are outnumbered. Reuters/Ipsos was able to compare the opinions of voters with the general public by creating two separate surveys: a poll of voters and a poll of the public.  For the voter poll, Reuters/Ipsos reconnected with people who took its exit poll on Nov. 8, 2016, the day of the U.S. presidential election. Those voters were sent additional questionnaires in May, July and October that asked if they approved or disapproved of the president.  Their responses were then compared with the results of a separate survey \u2013 the Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll \u2013 that surveys all adults in the United States. In May and July, the results of both polls were nearly identical, with about 40 percent of voters and the general adult population expressing approval for the president. The two polls diverged in October, however, with voters expressing stronger levels of approval than the general public.  Jan Leighley, an expert on political behavior at American University, said it makes sense that Trump is more popular among people who voted in the 2016 election. They were more likely to be white and less likely to identify with Democrats than the general public, she said.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English throughout the country. Some 1,206 of those 2016 voters took the  survey between May 10-12, followed by 1,296 who took the July 11-12 survey and 1,195 who took the survey between Oct. 18-19.\u00a0 Individual responses were weighted so they would reflect the latest population estimates, as well as the support their presidential pick received in the election. Each of the voter polls had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 5 percentage points for Republican voters. ",

        "title": "At a White House in crisis, Trump looks increasingly isolated",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the Trump White House, it\u2019s getting lonely at the top. President Donald Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress are showing signs of going their own way, both on politics and policy, determined to salvage what they can of their agenda on healthcare and tax reform in the wake of one of the most difficult weeks of any American presidency. At the same time, Trump\u2019s failure to fill senior roles at federal agencies means he does not have a cadre of loyalists who can help rein in a bureaucracy that many in Trump\u2019s orbit believe are out to leak information intended to damage the president. That has worsened the isolation of the White House in a city that relies on friends and allies to shake off a crisis. The result is problems on multiple fronts: a government whose bonds with Congress, federal agencies and the public look increasingly fractured; an ambitious but stalled program of reforms; and a president whose low approval ratings threaten his party\u2019s control of Congress in the 2018 midterm elections. Trump and his beleaguered staff, some White House aides told Reuters, feel besieged by a parade of negative stories and abandoned by fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill, as the furor over the firing of FBI Director James Comey and allegations that Trump tried to influence the probe into Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election show little sign of abating. Since Tuesday, when leaked excerpts of a purported memo by Comey detailing his conversations with Trump were made public, few Republicans beyond the White House have rushed to the airwaves to push back against suggestions that the president may have obstructed justice in asking Comey to end the probe into the conduct of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. As the Russia probe entered a new phase on Wednesday with the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel in the investigation, a move that will likely place the White House under even stronger scrutiny, some Republicans expressed surprise that the White House had not done more to recruit them to backstop the president. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of funny. The answer is no,\u201d said Senator James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, when asked by Reuters whether the White House had reached out to him to come to Trump\u2019s defense. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone else that has been contacted.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The White House did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Trump left on Friday for his first foreign trip as president. The 10-day trip will take him to Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Europe. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The administration has continued to struggle to fill the hundreds of open positions at senior levels of government that remain open, leaving the White House alone to grapple with one challenge after another. For example, the Justice Department still lacks senior officials in place to head up the anti-trust, civil rights, criminal, and civil divisions, as well as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to its website. At the Department of Homeland Security, the chiefs of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration, have yet to be confirmed. And at the Department of Education, a sprawling bureaucracy of 4,400 employees with a $68 billion budget, \u201call the key roles except for the secretary remain empty or filled with people in an acting capacity,\u201d said a Department of Education official. \u201cNobody knows when or if they will be filled anytime soon,\u201d said the official, who declined to be identified by name. The department did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has frequently complained that Senate Democrats have stalled the approval process for his nominees. But the White House has also been slower to send nominees to the Senate than previous administrations. Many top State Department posts also remain vacant. One consequence, say several officials, is that department experts played little role in briefing Trump for his telephone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin or his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, where officials say he disclosed highly classified intelligence. State Department and intelligence officials say that as power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few Trump loyalists in the White House, the roles of professional Foreign Service, intelligence and civil service officers have shrunk compared to past administrations. For instance, said two U.S. diplomats, no one from the State Department attended Trump\u2019s Feb. 15 meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - a sharp contrast from past administrations which would typically staff such a high-profile meeting with high-level State Department officials. Asked for comment, the State Department would not address the circumstances of the meeting with the Russian officials in the Oval Office, but did speak to the efforts involving Netanyahu and the Middle East.  \u201cAs the president has repeatedly noted, Middle East peace is a top priority for this administration,\u201d a department spokesperson said. \u201cThis is an effort supported by both the White House and the State Department.\u00a0Claims that the State Department has not been involved have no basis in facts.\u201d\u00a0 Overall, more than 500 of the 557 federal government positions requiring Senate confirmation remain vacant. Only 33 nominees have been confirmed, and only 57 other positions now have a nominee, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization in Washington. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A lack of communication from the White House left many Republicans on Capitol Hill frustrated as a sense of crisis mushroomed over the past week. One, Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own Russia probe, publicly complained about the situation. Tuesday morning, after news broke the previous evening that Trump had shared classified information with Russian officials, Burr said he couldn\u2019t get through to the White House, as the story lit up television news programs and buzzed online.  \u201cMaybe they\u2019re busy,\u201d he said. Some Republicans said the constant focus on responding to allegations concerning the Russia probe was draining their caucus of focus and energy to push through their agenda. Absent guidance, Republican staff members in Congress were beginning to devise their own strategy about how to respond to the gusher of bad news, one aide told Reuters.  And at the White House, with lines of communication to Congress seemingly frayed at times, a narrowing circle of people has come to the president\u2019s defense, as senior staff grapple not only with the cascade of revelations but with a president who at times contradicts on Twitter their talking points. \u201cEveryone is just tired,\u201d said one White House aide.

        "title": "What do I need to know about the CIA's hacking program?",
        "text": "(Reuters) - WikiLeaks, the website that specializes in exposing secrets, released thousands of documents that described internal U.S. Central Intelligence Agency discussions on hacking techniques it  used between 2013 and 2016 to circumvent security on electronic devices for spying.  U.S. officials said on Wednesday that CIA contractors were the likely source of the leak. The following are some questions and answers users of consumer electronics may have: Q: How many of the vulnerabilities described in the Wikileaks document are still open to exploit by hackers or spies? A: There is no definitive answer in the documents, which describe attack techniques but often do not give enough detail for even the device and software vendors to understand fully\u00a0how their products were targeted and close the security holes. Software updates have solved many of the flaws but it is unclear how many remain. In a chart of exploits for Apple\u2019s iPhone, the most recent version listed as hackable was iOS 9.2, which was released in late 2015. Q: What did we learn about the CIA\u2019s hacking program? A. WikiLeaks published documents that it says describe CIA tools for hacking into devices including mobile phones, computers and smart televisions. Q: How can you hack a TV? A: WikiLeaks said it identified a project known as Weeping Angel where U.S. and British intelligence agencies developed ways to take over Samsung smart TVs equipped with microphones, forcing them to record conversations when the device appeared to be turned off. Experts have long said smart TVs and other Internet-connected devices can be exploited to monitor a target. Q: Are these revelations new? A: While the specific details are new, it is well known in the cyber security community that intelligence agencies are constantly trying to leverage flaws in technology products to conduct espionage. Q: The documents suggest that the CIA can access information in encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal. I thought they were safe from even government spying? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A: No system is perfect. The documents describe ways to get information in those apps on Android devices, but only after gaining full control of those phones. Reuters has not found evidence in the documents released by WikiLeaks that the CIA had figured a way to break the encryption in those apps. Q: Are iPhones also vulnerable? A: The documents discuss ways to get into iPhones as well. One appeared to show a list of Apple iOS security flaws purchased by U.S. intelligence agencies so they could gain access to those devices. Q: What should I do if I\u2019m worried? A: Most people do not need to worry about being targeted by intelligence agencies. But everybody should stay on top of software patches so all their computers, mobile phones and other connected devices are running software with the latest security updates. Consumers should balance security concerns with their need to use smart devices. Q: What did we learn about how the CIA may try to make American hacking look like the work of hackers from other countries like Russia?  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A: The CIA has a library of attack code taken from multiple sources and sorted by function, including a program from a Russian criminal kit that permits spyware to survive rebooting and a data-destruction tool lifted from a suspected Iranian operation. One purpose of such a collection is to avoid having to write programs from scratch, while another is to confuse anyone who discovers the malware in action. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The documents released so far do not show that the CIA set out to deceive victims into believing they had been hacked by someone else, but it suggests that the agency was capable of doing so if it wanted.  Q: Is this as big as the leaks from former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden? A: The Snowden leaks revealed that the NSA was secretly collecting U.S. call metadata on ordinary Americans. The materials released by WikiLeaks on Tuesday did not appear to reveal the existence of unknown any unknown programs. Instead they supplied details on how U.S. intelligence agencies work to discover and exploit security flaws to conduct espionage.  Q: How damaging is this revelation to U.S. intelligence? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A:\u00a0U.S. intelligence officials say the damage is limited because much of what was published is old, a number of the vulnerabilities in smart TVs and other devices have been known for at least two years and many have been patched. The breach   was discovered late last year according to U.S. officials and most or all of the tools Wikileaks published are no longer in use. In addition, they said, unless additional codes that would enable users to exploit the leaked material are also published, it would be difficult for other countries, groups, or people to use the leaked material against the United States or its allies. Q: Are the documents authentic? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A: Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents. U.S. officials told Reuters that they believe the documents are authentic. While the CIA has declined to comment, independent cyber security experts and former intelligence agency employees who have looked through them say that they appear to be authentic, citing code words used to describe CIA hacking programs. Q: How did WikiLeaks get the information? \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A: Unclear. Someone inside the agency may have leaked the information. Or, someone outside may have figured out a way to steal it. U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday that contractors were the likely source for the leak. Q: What has the U.S. government and other governments said in response? A: The White House said U.S. President Donald Trump was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about the CIA security breach that led to the WikiLeaks release. Germany\u2019s chief federal prosecutor\u2019s office said it would review the Wikileaks documents which suggest the CIA ran a hacking hub from the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, and would launch a formal investigation if warranted.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China s ambassador to Washington on Friday called on the United States to refrain from making threats over North Korea, which a day earlier launched another missile over Japan into the Pacific Ocean. Ambassador Cui Tiankai told reporters at an embassy event:  Honestly, I think the United States should be doing ... much more than now, so that there s real effective international cooperation on this issue.   They should refrain from issuing more threats. They should do more to find effective ways to resume dialogue and negotiation,  he said. President Donald Trump and others in the United States and beyond have urged China to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on its Communist ally to help resolve the standoff over North Korea s weapons programmes. China fought alongside North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War, in which Chinese leader Mao Zedong lost his eldest son, and Beijing has long been Pyongyang s chief ally and primary trade partner. But the Chinese government has pushed back against the notion that it has any control over Pyongyang, and says it is the United States that should be doing more. Trump tweeted earlier this month that the United States was considering halting trade with countries doing business with North Korea. Cui on Friday cautioned against putting China-U.S. trade on the table.  Efforts to undermine Sino-U.S. trade, or even slapping sanctions on China, I think would be off-target,  the Chinese state news agency Xinhua quoted Cui as saying on Friday at a Chinese National Day reception.  If someone were to pressure China or impose sanctions on China over the DPRK, it would not be supported by many U.S. citizens,  Cui said, referring to North Korea by the acronym for its official name, Democratic People s Republic of Korea.  Workers at U.S. airplane factories, farmers growing soybeans, companies that sell smartphones to China, manufacturers that enjoy large market shares in China, companies in the service sector that have gained trade surplus in China, U.S. states that engage in robust trade with China would all stand against it,  Xinhua quoted him as saying.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer will serve as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s press secretary in the White House when he takes office next month, Trump announced on Thursday. To round out his communications team, the president-elect  appointed loyalists from his upstart presidential campaign. Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s sole spokeswoman when he began what was considered a longshot candidacy in June 2015, will be director of strategic communications. Jason Miller was appointed director of communications and Dan Scavino was named director of social media. Spicer, 45, served as RNC spokesman during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, alongside party chairman Reince Priebus, who stood by Trump amid furious opposition from establishment Republicans and was rewarded with the chief of staff position. Acerbic and professional, Spicer, a Navy Reserve commander, has been openly critical of media coverage of Republican candidates and the president-elect, but insists the future U.S. leader has a high regard for press freedom. \u201cWe understand and respect the role that the press plays in a democracy. It is healthy, it\u2019s important. But it\u2019s a two-way street,\u201d Spicer told Politico recently, before bashing the news outlet for what he said was exclusively negative coverage. Spicer, who has been a spokesman for the Trump transition team, has a long background in public affairs. He led a turnaround in the RNC\u2019s public affairs operation after taking over as communications director in 2011. He beefed up social media operations, built an in-house TV production team and created a rapid response effort to reply to attacks. Spicer worked in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration as the assistant U.S. Trade Representative for media and public affairs. Before that, he was communications director for the Republican Conference in the U.S. House of Representatives. Spicer has tried to reassure news organizations that Trump will not try to ban them from covering him, as the president-elect sometimes sought to do during the election campaign. But Spicer and other Trump aides have indicated the new president would shake up the status quo in White House dealings with the media, including re-examining the need for daily televised news briefings and the practice of assigned seating in the briefing room. \u201cI think we have to look at everything,\u201d Spicer told Fox News when asked about the briefings. \u201cAnd so I don\u2019t know that it needs to be daily. I don\u2019t know that they all need to be on camera.\u201d  ",

His face hidden by a headdress, a man who identified himself as Lushsux said against the backdrop of a cement section of the Israeli wall in Bethlehem that he hoped his painting would draw attention to Palestinians stuck in  an indoor prison .

Israelis deem the project a bulwark against Palestinian attack.  The wall is a message in itself,  the man, who said he painted the mural overnight, told Reuters.  I don t need to write  Free Palestine  or something like that, something really direct ... that people will ignore.  I just paint what I usually paint and maybe people will start looking at the background and looking at the razor wire and looking at people stuck in here, and maybe that ll work better,  he said in Australian-accented English. Murals on the barrier believed to be the work of Lushsux include one showing Trump kissing an Israeli watchtower and another depicting him placing his hand on the barrier and thinking about building a similar wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.

        "text": "HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuban President Raul Castro made it clear to a visiting U.S. congressional delegation that his country was intent on pursuing market reform and detente with the United States, U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy told a news conference on Wednesday. Leahy, a Democrat who has been key in efforts to normalize relations, was leading a bipartisan group of five U.S. senators and a representative on a three-day visit to the Communist-run island to discuss ties and explore business opportunities. Cuba watchers are looking closely for signs of how the fragile U.S. detente with Cuba will fare under Republican President Donald Trump, who has threatened to backtrack on it if he does not get \u201ca better deal.\u201d Analysts say Cuba has played its cards well so far by not responding shrilly to such provocation and demonstrating its continued willingness to engage under the new president. Castro \u201cwants reform to continue, he wants the movement forwards to continue,\u201d said Leahy at the news conference in the U.S. embassy, after meeting with the Cuban president on Tuesday. \u201cThe number of people he had from his administration talk to us made it very clear they want us to continue.\u201d The delegation met with Cuba\u2019s foreign, trade and agriculture ministers as well as with Castro. The group included Republican Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi who on Monday oversaw the signing of agreements between Cuba and two Mississippi ports. \u201cIncreasingly this issue of normalizing relations with Cuba is bipartisan, this isn\u2019t just Democrats, there are a lot of Republicans that believe we ought to do this as well,\u201d said Representative James McGovern, a Democrat. Support for the detente was also growing among the business and academic communities, said McGovern, who was traveling with a group of U.S. biotech experts keen to explore the sector in Cuba. \u201cThe movement is more significant in the U.S.A. today than at any time in my career in the Senate,\u201d said Leahy. \u201cAnd I am the dean of the Senate, I have been there the longest,\u201d added Leahy, who was first elected to the Senate in 1974.  The White House said earlier this month that the Trump administration was in the midst of \u201ca full review of all U.S. policies towards Cuba.\u201d The visit came as a diplomatic incident highlighted continuing concerns about restrictions on human rights on the island. Cuban authorities prevented the head of the Organization of American States (OAS), a former Chilean minister and an ex-president of Mexico from traveling to Cuba to attend an award ceremony on Wednesday hosted by dissidents. Cuba opposes anything that legitimizes dissidents, who it claims are mercenaries funded by foreign interests. It also views the OAS as an imperialist instrument of the United States. OAS chief Luis Almagro reported that Cuban authorities said they were \u201castonished\u201d at his involvement in \u201canti-Cuban activities\u201d which were \u201can unacceptable provocation.\u201d A U.S. embassy official attended the ceremony, organized by the Latin American Network of Youth for Democracy, a group opposed to the Communist government. Almagro\u2019s seat was left empty in symbolic protest. \u201cIt may not be the smoothest of paths but it will continue,\u201d Leahy said of the U.S.-Cuban detente. \u201cI would not be here today on one more trip if I didn\u2019t think that continuation of that progress is inevitable.\u201d ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. liberal groups, divided in their support of Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, have urged a united, active opposition to Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner. In an open letter released on Tuesday, a group of liberal organizations called for a \u201cnon-violent movement\u201d to thwart Trump\u2019s candidacy for November\u2019s general election, calling the New York billionaire a \u201chate-peddling bigot who openly incites violence.\u201d  \u201cThis is a five-alarm fire for our democracy,\u201d said the letter, which was signed by the leaders of the liberal advocacy group MoveOn.org, a supporter of Sanders, and the Service Employees International Union, a major labor union that is backing Clinton.  Representatives of 20 other groups signed the letter, which was published online as Americans in five states voted in the latest round of primary contests to pick party nominees for the Nov. 8 election. Trump has alarmed many in America, not just liberals, with his campaign rhetoric, from calling Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers to his proposal to ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States. Protests have become a recurring, noisy feature at Trump\u2019s rallies and in recent days, tensions have risen sharply as a few of Trump\u2019s mostly white supporters have punched or bloodied protesters, many of whom are black or Latino, in scuffles in or outside campaign venues. The open letter urged Americans to use tactics familiar from the civil-rights movement to oppose Trump, including large public marches and prayer vigils. It told Americans to ask \u201cevery media outlet, corporation, and office-holder\u201d whether they will condemn what the letter described as Trump\u2019s \u201cracism, misogyny and xenophobia.\u201d The letter also called for efforts to increase voter turn-out in November, hoping to beat Trump if he becomes the Republican nominee.  Some Republican politicians, including the party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, have also called for efforts to prevent Trump winning the party\u2019s nomination in July, including tactical voting. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has said in media interviews he does not condone violence, but at rallies he has sometimes encouraged people to use force on protesters, drawing condemnation from both Democratic and Republican politicians.  Many protesters have told journalists they are supporters of Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, and Clinton, a former secretary of state. Trump, who canceled a rally in Chicago last week after hundreds of protesters got inside the venue, has said  it is unfair that his events are disrupted more than those of any other candidate. ",

        "text": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police used tear gas and batons on Tuesday to disperse protesters who say election officials should be sacked before the re-run of a presidential vote because they favor President Uhuru Kenyatta. Several volleys of tear gas were fired near the election commission headquarters in central Nairobi, a Reuters witness said. When protestors regrouped, officers fired more tear gas and beat some with batons. By mid-afternoon calm had returned. Raila Odinga, who lost his presidential bid on Aug. 8, will get another chance after the Supreme Court annulled the election citing irregularities and ordered a fresh vote within 60 days. However, Odinga has accused the election commission, known as the IEBC, of being a puppet of Kenyatta s ruling Jubilee party and said he will not participate in the Oct. 26 re-run if election officials are not sacked and prosecuted. The court did not find any individual responsible but said institutional failings had led to irregularities and illegalities in the transmission of election results.  The election commission has asked the opposition to call off protests until the IEBC has explained the various measures being taken to  enhance the credibility and integrity  of the vote.  IEBC cannot begin the process of an honest election as long as those responsible for the irregularities and illegalities are still lurking in its corridors,  Odinga told reporters.  IEBC has refused to dismiss or suspend them. That is why we are today beginning these peaceful campaigns to force them out by public pressure so the process of a fair election can at last begin,  he added. Last week Kenya s chief prosecutor ordered investigations into 11 election board officials including its chief executive, Ezra Chiloba, as well as a lawyer and campaigner who worked for Odinga. Speaking as protestors gathered outside his office, Chiloba said he would not resign.  I have (a) responsibility before me and I have to discharge that responsibility,  he told Kenya s KTN television network. Some Kenyatta supporters also took to the streets in Nairobi but there were no clashes between the two sides. In the port city of Mombasa, a crowd gathered at local election office, chanting:  No reforms no elections. Chiloba must go!  The Kenyan government in a statement accused  mobs of hooligans  of taking advantage of the protests to destroy property and said  a number of criminals  had been arrested and would be taken to court.  Underscoring the rising tensions, a newly elected opposition lawmaker was charged with subversion at a court hearing in Nairobi on Tuesday. Paul Ongili Owino was arrested after a video clip of him speaking while campaigning for Odinga emerged on social media in which he called Kenyatta a son of a dog. The prosecution said those words were  calculated to excite disaffection against the presidency . Ahead of Tuesday s demonstrations by the opposition National Super Alliance coalition, Kenyatta had said violence would not be tolerated.  People are free to demonstrate but they must ensure that they do not destroy other people s property,  he said.  Let them not think that they will break into other people s shops and interfere with the daily routine of other Kenyans. That, we shall not allow,  he said. In the western city of Kisumu, an Odinga stronghold where some 3,000 protestors gathered, one protestor, vegetable market vendor Hellen Aketch said:  I will support anything that assures me of the validity and the safety of my vote in the upcoming elections.   I have closed (my) business today and I am ready to do it again so long as some sanity is realized among those who hold public office.  ",

        "text": "CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian lawmaker is introducing a draft bill that would imprison those engaging in or promoting same-sex relations, a copy of the draft seen by Reuters on Thursday showed. Amnesty International said the bill is  another nail in the coffin for sexual rights in Egypt  and should be scrapped. It would introduce sentences of to up to 10 years in prison for people engaging in or promoting same-sex relations. The law is part of a wider crackdown against homosexuality that started in September when a group of people were seen raising a rainbow flag at a concert, a rare public show of support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights in the conservative Muslim country.  If passed, this law would further entrench stigma and abuse against people based on their perceived sexual orientation,  said Najia Bounaim, North Africa Campaigns Director at Amnesty International.  The Egyptian authorities must urgently scrap this draft law and put an end to this alarming wave of homophobic persecution,  Bounaim added. The crackdown comes as Egypt, a main Western ally in the Middle East, is under fire for its human rights record and the United States has withheld some of its $1.3 billion in annual military aid. At least 70 people have been arrested and some have been subjected to anal examinations that amount to torture since September. Homosexuality is not specifically outlawed in Egypt but discrimination is rife. Gay men are frequently arrested and typically charged with debauchery, immorality or blasphemy. Egyptian authorities do not deny going after gays. Gay men and rights activists say the LGBT community has been facing an aggressive crackdown since 2013, when President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as military chief ousted President Mohamed Mursi, an Islamist.

Bosnian Muslims generally practice a moderate form of Islam but some have adopted radical Salafi Islam from foreign fighters who came to the country during its 1992-95 war to fight alongside Muslims against Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats. Some joined Islamic State in Syria and Iraq but police said departures had stopped completely in the past 18 months and more than half of those who returned have been jailed under a law prohibiting people to fight in foreign countries. Czech President Milos Zeman has said there was a risk Islamic State may form its European base in Bosnia, where  ISIS (Islamic State) black flags are already flying in several towns , according to reports.  Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic has warned of  thousands of fighters returning to Bosnia from Syria and Iraq , while Croatian magazine Globus last week put the number of radicalized Bosnian Muslims at 5,000-10,000. Zvizdic said such allegations were unfounded and politically motivated and could damage Bosnia as an investment and tourism destination.   ISIS flags are not flying in Bosnia,  Zvizdic told reporters after meeting the security minister and the heads of five security and intelligence agencies.       There have been no departures to foreign war zones, we have not had any incident that could be characterized as an act of terrorism and we work to prevent the possibility of any such incident,  Zvizdic said, referring to the last two years during which several terrorist attacks took place across Europe.   Bosnia s security agencies say a total of 240 Bosnian citizens have departed to fight for Islamic State since 2012, and 116 remained there. Out of 44 who had returned to Bosnia, 23 were jailed. Security Minister Dragan Mektic said terrorism threats in Bosnia were mainly external and its agencies last month prevented a person with possible links to terrorists from entering the country.  In 2015, two Bosnian army soldiers and a policeman were killed in two separate attacks in Bosnia. No links to wider groups was found.    ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said on Tuesday that amendments to a bill to lower sentences for certain non-violent drug offenders are close to being finished.  Grassley said the amendments, which go further to ensure violent offenders are not released, will build more support for the bill among Republican leadership in the Senate, which will decide whether to bring the bill up for a vote.  \u201cWe are very close to making some changes in this bill so we can get it brought before the United States Senate,\u201d Grassley said. Lowering the sentences of drug offenders sentenced under older and more severe laws has been touted as one of the lone areas of bipartisan agreement in a sharply divided U.S. political climate.  Grassley, who once stood in opposition to sentencing reform, introduced a comprehensive criminal justice bill in October that was endorsed by the White House.  In January, a group of Republicans led by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton raised concerns about the bill, citing its potential to qualify thousands of violent criminals for early release.  Criminal justice reform advocates say the legislation would not guarantee the release of violent criminals but simply allow their cases to be reevaluated by a judge.  Grassley called Cotton\u2019s concerns \u201clegitimate and reasonable\u201d when speaking at Georgetown University Law School on Tuesday.  Though he did not provide specifics on the amendments, Grassley did say his team of legislators may have to drop parts of the bill that would have allowed offenders caught with firearms in their possession to have their sentences lowered.  \u201cWe may have to jettison some changes in the firearm offenses and we may be able to do a better job to make sure that no one with a serious history of violence can get any relief under the bill,\u201d Grassley said.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not made any guarantee that he will bring the bill to the Senate floor for a vote. But Grassley said the amendments will increase those chances.  \u201cI\u2019m confident that with the changes that we\u2019re making in the bill that we\u2019ll get even more support for our bill,\u201d Grassley said.  \u201cAnd with more support, I\u2019m confident that we will be able to go to the leaders in the Senate and persuade them that this bill is exactly what the American people need to see happen in the United States Senate.\u201d ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In April 2014, the administration of President Barack Obama announced the most ambitious clemency program in 40 years, inviting thousands of jailed drug offenders and other convicts to seek early release and urging lawyers across the country to take on their cases. Nearly two years later the program is struggling under a deluge of unprocessed cases, sparking concern within the administration and among justice reform advocates over the fate of what was meant to be legacy-defining achievement for Obama. More than 8,000 cases out of more than 44,000 federal inmates who applied have yet to make it to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for review, lawyers involved in the program told Reuters. That is in addition to about 9,000 cases that are still pending at the DOJ, according to the department\u2019s own figures. Only 187 inmates have had their sentences commuted, far below the thousands expected by justice reform advocates and a tiny fraction of the 2.2 million people behind bars in the United States, which has the world\u2019s highest incarceration rate. The administration said it wanted to decide on all the applications before Obama\u2019s term ends next January, when the program will automatically expire.  A senior DOJ official told Reuters it is calling on the lawyers\u2019 group \u2014 Clemency Project 2014 \u2014 to simply hand over the outstanding cases without further vetting, saying it is not working fast enough. So far, the group estimates it has handed over around 200 cases. But criminal justice experts say the administration itself should bear much of the blame. The idea to tap pro-bono attorneys to help vet the cases originated with the DOJ, and critics say it should have prepared its own staff to handle the large volume of applications. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to criticize the volunteer group that you asked to help,\u201d said Rachel Barkow, a criminal law professor at New York University who has studied clemency in U.S. prisons. She estimates that about 1,500 prisoners should be eligible for commutation, saying the 187 granted so far does not \u201cfulfill the promise of the program.\u201d  The DOJ declined to comment when asked for its response to such criticism. The delays have left prisoners like Linda Byrnes, 69, in limbo. \u201cI thought clemency was for people like me,\u201d Byrnes told Reuters through an electronic messaging system from a federal prison in Alderson, West Virginia. Byrnes, who has spent 20 years in prison for distributing marijuana and has two years left on her sentence, was recently diagnosed with mouth cancer and has yet to hear whether she has been assigned a lawyer after submitting her application to Clemency Project in August 2014. Obama, who has commuted more sentences than the past five presidents combined, has been a stern critic of harsh U.S. sentencing policies that he says have disproportionately burdened minorities. Federal life sentences have fallen since Obama took office, from 280 in fiscal year 2009 to 153 in 2013, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. About three quarters of the sentences were given to minorities and most were for non-violent offences, the report said. Clemency Project 2014 said it does not comment publicly on the individuals it represents. The group vets the applications, writes the petitions and sends them to the Justice Department\u2019s Office of the Pardon Attorney, which oversees all pardons and sentence commutations and makes recommendations for the president\u2019s approval.  So far, 25,000 of 34,000 applications received by Clemency Project have been rejected for failing to meet the basic criteria - no record of violence, no significant ties to a gang or drug cartel, good behavior in prison and completion of at least 10 years of sentence. About 10,000 inmates did not go through the Clemency Project and either applied directly to DOJ or through a paid attorney.\u00a0 \u201cIt really would be a sad state of affairs if individuals who had asked for a lawyer weren\u2019t considered in time because their petitions never reached the pardon attorney\u2019s office,\u201d a DOJ official told Reuters on the condition of anonymity. (Graphic on the clemency bottleneck: tmsnrt.rs/1VThxVT) A large number of mostly unqualified applications, a shortage of lawyers and the complexity of the cases have slowed progress, said Cynthia Roseberry, project manager for Clemency Project 2014. \u201cThere are a lot of gray areas,\u201d said Roseberry, who estimates it takes 30 days for one lawyer to review one case on average. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to unpack each of these applicants to see specifically what factors affect them... and so that takes a little more time.\u201d This includes finding pre-sentencing reports for each case, determining if the person would have received a shorter sentence under current law and reviewing prison behavior records. Roseberry said the group was unaware of any request from the Justice Department to hand over the pending applications. Roseberry said the group\u2019s initially slow pace has picked up in recent months.\u00a0 The Justice Department declined to elaborate on its private communication with the lawyers. The Pardon Attorney\u2019s office has brought in personnel from other parts of the department to help to speed up reviews of petitions, the DOJ official said. Roseberry said about 3,000 applicants still need to be assigned to a lawyer, and that it was not certain whether the group will be able to submit all of the applications it has received before Obama leaves office.  The group has more than 570 law firms and 30 law schools contributing to the effort. Some rejected prisoners and those who have yet to hear a decision say they believe they would have had a better chance if they had sent their clemency petition directly to the government. Josie Ledezma was sentenced to life for conspiracy to transport cocaine and applied for clemency through Clemency Project 2014. She said she did not hear from them for six months and later learned that her assigned lawyer had shut down her legal practice. In January, nearly one year after applying, she was told Clemency Project 2014 could not help her and encouraged her to apply directly. \u201cI wrote back and asked what was it that made me not qualify, but never got a response,\u201d Ledezma told Reuters through an electronic messaging service for federal prisoners.

        "title": "Countdown to Brexit breakthrough?",
        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Here is a timeline of the coming few days that will determine whether Britain avoids further costly delays in giving business assurances of a smooth exit from the European Union and of free trade with its biggest market in the future:  May wants the EU to open the second phase of Brexit negotiations concerning relations after Britain s withdrawal on March 30, 2019. The EU will only do that if there is  sufficient progress  in agreeing  divorce  terms, notably on three key issues: a financial settlement, guaranteed rights for EU citizens in Britain and a  soft border  with Ireland. A deal on money is effectively done, EU officials said last week. There are indications of agreement on citizens  rights. But opposition from British Prime Minister Theresa May s key allies in Northern Ireland to treating the province differently from the mainland in a bid to maintain an open EU land border with EU-member Ireland scuppered a deal on Monday. As part of the  choreography  for a political deal, the EU set May an  absolute deadline  of Monday to provide new offers in time for the other EU leaders to approve a move to Phase 2 at a summit of the EU-27 on Dec. 15. That is now pushed back till the end of the week, EU officials say. May is pushing for a simultaneous, reciprocal guarantee from the EU of a soft transition and future trade deal, which she may use to show Britons what her compromises have secured. The EU wants to have firm British offers which the 27 can discuss before leaders commit. The result is some complex dance steps: Wednesday, Dec. 6? May is expected to return to Brussels as soon as Wednesday. If European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier emerge from the meeting to pronounce that  sufficient progress  has been made, summit chair Donald Tusk will then distribute draft guidelines for the EU negotiating position in trade talks to the other 27 governments. Monday, Dec.  11 EU-27 sherpas meet to prepare the summit - a key moment for national leaders  advisers to seek changes to guidelines. Tuesday, Dec. 12 EU affairs ministers of EU-27 meet to prepare summit. Thursday, Dec. 14 4 p.m. - May attends routine EU summit in Brussels. Defense, social affairs, foreign affairs and migration are on the agenda. Friday, Dec. 15 After May has left, EU-27 leaders hold Brexit summit. If they have had enough time, they could acknowledge sufficient progress and endorse the trade negotiating guidelines, including proposed terms for a two-year, status-quo transition period. January - Outline of EU transition offer, to be included in the 2019 withdrawal treaty may be ready. Under it, Britain is likely to retain most rights except voting in the bloc, and meet all its obligations until the end of 2020. February - After fine-tuning their negotiating position, EU-27 may be ready to open talks with London on a free trade pact that Brussels likens to one it has with Canada. The EU estimated at some 60 billion euros ($71 billion) what Britain should pay to cover outstanding obligations on leaving. EU officials say there is now agreement after Britain offered to pay an agreed share of most of the items Brussels wanted, especially for committed spending that will go on after 2020. Both sides say there is no precise figure as much depends on future developments. British newspaper reports that it would cost up to 55 billion euros sparked only muted criticism from May s hardline pro-Brexit allies who once rejected big payments. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Saturday that London would be paying the EU 60 billion euros on Brexit. Barnier is still seeking a commitment that the rights of 3 million EU citizens who stay on in Britain after Brexit will be guaranteed by the European Court of Justice, not just by British judges. May has said the ECJ should play no more role in Britain. But the issue could be vital to ensure ratification of the withdrawal treaty by the European Parliament. EU officials say a compromise may be to let the Luxembourg-based ECJ oversee cases on citizens rights for only a few years after Brexit. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said London agreed on Monday that Northern Ireland, a British province, would remain in  regulatory alignment  with the EU, and hence the Irish Republic, to ensure there was no  hard border  with police and customs checks that could disrupt peace. However, a hostile reaction from May s pro-Brexit and pro-London allies in Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), on whom she depends for her slim parliamentary majority, caused her to hold off agreeing the package deal with Juncker. The DUP and many in May s own party fear that means separating the province from the British mainland - or forcing EU rules onto the whole of the UK. Leaders of mainland regions Scotland, Wales and London leapt on the deal to demand similar freedom to perhaps remain in the EU customs union or single market, giving May a new headache.  Varadkar said he is willing to see changes in the text - but not something that would change its actual meaning.  ",

        "title": "As private lawyer, Trump high court pick was friend to business",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As a lawyer in private practice for a decade, President Donald Trump\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch often fought on behalf of business interests, including efforts to curb securities class action lawsuits, experience that could mould his thinking if he is confirmed as a justice. Gorsuch, a conservative federal appeals court judge from Colorado nominated by wealthy businessman Trump on Tuesday, could turn out to be a friend to business, having represented the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in fending off securities class actions, one of the most hotly contested areas of corporate law. The chamber is the largest U.S. business lobbying group. If confirmed, Gorsuch would be one of the only current justices with extensive experience on business issues in private practice.  Securities class action lawsuits are filed by investors who allege misconduct by a company whose stock price has tanked, hurting investors\u2019 portfolios. These once-common lawsuits now face higher hurdles and are filed less often. Congress passed laws in 1995 and 1998 making it harder to bring securities class actions. Later court rulings, including one in which Gorsuch was involved, clarified the requirements under the laws. From 1995 to 2005, Gorsuch worked at boutique law firm Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel in Washington, becoming a partner in 1998. He had a wide range of clients, including individuals and nonprofits, as well as various business interests. While there, he filed two briefs on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce seeking limits to securities class actions. One of Gorsuch\u2019s briefs came in a securities fraud case called Dura Pharmaceuticals v. Broudo. The Supreme Court in 2005 ruled unanimously for the company, but did not issue the kind of broad ruling Gorsuch had sought, said Patrick Coughlin, the lawyer who argued the case on behalf of the investors who sued. Of Gorsuch\u2019s role, Coughlin said representing the Chamber of Commerce is the epitome of corporate defense work for a lawyer. \u201cThe chamber had always been against us,\u201d Coughlin said, referring to class action lawyers. \u201cHe\u2019d always been on the other side of what we were doing, so it was not surprising he was selected by Trump.\u201d Prior to the ruling, Gorsuch co-wrote an article in the Legal Times trade publication for lawyers in which he described some securities class actions as a \u201cfree ride to fast riches\u201d for plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers. He said the Dura case was a chance for the court to \u201ccurb frivolous fraud claims\u201d in which plaintiffs cannot prove a stock price drop was caused by misrepresentations by a company. Gorsuch\u2019s background promises to be valuable on the Supreme Court, which hears a significant number of business disputes among the roughly 70 cases considered each annual term.  Businesses have been trying with mixed success to get the Supreme Court to put new curbs on class action litigation beyond the securities context. Class actions can lead to huge jury awards against companies and is harder to defend against than lawsuits brought by individuals. If confirmed by the U.S. Senate in time, Gorsuch could play an immediate role in a major case on whether companies can head off costly class action lawsuits by forcing employees to give up their right to pursue work-related legal claims in court as a group. Paul Bland, executive director of consumer advocacy group Public Justice, said he hoped Gorsuch, if confirmed, would see that \u201cmost of what he saw as meritless cases in 2005 have been weeded out, and that the vast majority of the cases that remain raise substantial issues that protect investors.\u201d Chamber of Commerce official Tom Collamore joined Trump at the White House on Wednesday for a meeting with advocacy groups touting Gorsuch\u2019s pick, calling it \u201ca fantastic nomination.\u201d The chamber declined comment on Gorsuch\u2019s work for the group. In a statement issued after the nomination was announced, chamber President Tom Donohue congratulated Trump on the selection. When Democratic President Barack Obama last March nominated appeals court judge Merrick Garland to fill the same vacant seat on the court, there was no press release from the chamber. Senate Republicans refused to act on Garland\u2019s nomination, a move that paved the way for Trump to nominate Gorsuch to replace fellow conservative Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. Describing his career in private practice, Gorsuch said in his Senate questionnaire prior to his appointment by Republican President George W. Bush to the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006 that he was \u201cinvolved in matters large and small for clients ranging from individuals to nonprofits to corporations,\u201d on such issues as racketeering, securities fraud and antitrust.  His former Washington law firm stressed in a statement that Gorsuch had a \u201cwide variety\u201d of clients and cited a case in which he represented people who had been targeted over payday loans. David Frederick, a lawyer at the firm, called Gorsuch \u201ca dogged, very determined lawyer.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of lawyer you would want to have representing you,\u201d Frederick said. After leaving the firm, but before becoming a judge, he spent just over a year in Bush\u2019s Justice Department. One of his roles was overseeing antitrust litigation involving the government. ",

        "text": "MADRID (Reuters) - Spain will send more state police to Catalonia to block any moves to hold a banned independence referendum, the interior ministry said on Friday. The government in Madrid is facing one of its biggest political crises since the end of the Franco dictatorship and  the return of democracy four decades ago. It has called the referendum an illegal act and taken police and court action to block it. The new officers would monitor public spaces, keep order and  act in case the illegal referendum is maintained,  the ministry said in a statement. Catalonia s regional government said new measures including a ban on police time off were over the top and meant to create a false impression of crisis.  All you need is eyes in your head to see there is no violence,  spokesman Jordi Turull said. Catalan leaders have said they are determined to hold the vote on Oct. 1, defying the central Madrid government and a Constitutional Court ban. They have also said the Catalan assembly would declare independence within 48 hours of a  yes  vote. State police already on the ground carried out unprecedented raids on regional government offices, printers, newspapers and delivery companies, searching for campaign material on Wednesday. Spanish media have said between 3,000 and 4,000 state officers have already arrived or are on their way, though the interior ministry did not give any numbers. The reinforcements will join 5,000 state police already based in the region. The ministry said they would back up Catalonia s separate police force, called Mossos d Esquadra, which would remain in charge. So far the state and local police forces have worked together well, but Spanish government officials say in private the Mossos could do more to block the vote and maintain order. The Catalan interior minister said the new state forces on the ground were one more step toward taking over the local police, a move that is seen as unlikely by most observers because it would be reminiscent of the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War, when the force was abolished.  The state is laying the groundwork to take over the Mossos d Esquadra. It s a clear attempt to discredit it,  said Joaquim Forn on Twitter. The Catalan government earlier this week accused the Spanish authorities of effectively taking over its administration after state police raided its offices and arrested officials, and the finance ministry took control of the local finance department. Authorities have had to billet some of the new officers in three ferries rented by the Spanish government and moored in the harbors of Barcelona and Tarragona because of both a shortage of temporary housing and to avoid clashes between protesters and police forces.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Monday confirmed Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai for another five-year term on the telecommunications regulatory panel where he faces decisions over dismantling Obama-era internet protections and a major television station merger. Pai won confirmation by 52-41 over objections from Democrats, who criticized him for moving to deregulate U.S. telecommunications rules. Republicans praised him for taking steps to boost rural internet service. The former Justice Department, FCC and Capitol Hill staffer has been moving swiftly to undo many of the regulations adopted by the FCC during the Obama administration since assuming the chairmanship and vowed in December to take a \u201cweed whacker\u201d to unneeded rules. Pai pledged in a statement on Monday to continue to focus \u201con bridging the digital divide, promoting innovation, protecting consumers and public safety, and making the FCC more open and transparent.\u201d He joined the FCC as a commissioner in March 2012 and was elevated to chairman by President Donald Trump in January. In April, Pai proposed overturning the 2015 net neutrality rules, with a final vote expected later this year. Pai \u201chas established a clear record of favoring big corporations at the expense of consumers, innovators, and small businesses,\u201d Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said. The rules, which the FCC put in place under Democratic President Barack Obama, prohibit broadband providers from giving or selling access to a speedier internet - essentially a \u201cfast lane.\u201d Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, praised Pai\u2019s proposal to withdraw the Obama internet rules and \u201crebalance its regulatory posture.\u201d The rules reclassified internet service providers much like utilities. They were favored by web companies like Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and others, which said they would guarantee equal access to the internet. Internet providers such as AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp argue the net neutrality rules make investment in additional capacity less likely and could lead to rate regulation. In April, the FCC voted 2-1 for Pai\u2019s proposal to reverse a 2016 decision that limits the number of television stations some broadcasters can buy.  That cleared the way for Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc\u2019s proposed $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co. Senator Elizabeth Warren on Monday criticized Pai for \u201cworking for the most powerful communications corporations\u201d and making it easier for the Sinclair deal to proceed. ",

        "title": "Democrats press U.S. housing nominee Carson on potential Trump conflicts",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democrats on Thursday pressed Ben Carson, Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead housing policy, on potential conflicts of interest between the agency he is set to run and properties in which the president-elect may hold a financial stake. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) hands out billions of dollars each year to developers and landlords. Democrats grilling Carson during his confirmation hearing for the post expressed concerns that some of that taxpayer money could end up directed to Trump or members of his family. \u201cThe president-elect is hiding his family businesses interests from you, from me, and the rest of America,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of Trump\u2019s most vocal critics, told Carson. \u201cHe can divert taxpayer money into his own pockets without the American people knowing about it.\u201d Trump, a New York businessman who got his start in real estate, has refused to release his tax returns or provide detailed information about his holdings across the globe. On Wednesday, he announced that he would turn control of his business empire over to his two oldest sons and move his assets into a trust. Those moves, however, have not assuaged some critics who argue that, as president, Trump will still have undisclosed financial interests that could affect his policies. Pushed on the issue by Democrats, Carson at one point vowed he would monitor any potential conflicts of interest but said  he was unsure about how to go about it. Asked how he would prevent conflicts, the retired neurosurgeon and former Republican presidential candidate told the Senate Banking Committee, \u201cI would hope what would happen with this committee is that we could come up with a suggestion that might be acceptable to all sides.\u201d Trump reportedly has an interest in the massive Starrett City housing project in the New York City of Brooklyn, which has received HUD funds. But Trump\u2019s real estate career has focused mainly on luxury housing, commercial real estate and resort properties. Earlier in the hearing, Carson was noncommittal when Warren asked him to ensure that no HUD programs would benefit Trump.  \u201cIf there happens to be an extraordinarily good program that is working for millions of people and it turns that someone you\u2019re targeting is going to gain $10 from it, am I going to say, \u2018No, the rest of you Americans can\u2019t have it?\u2019\u201d Carson responded. Carson is widely expected to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate committee and full Senate. Much of Thursday\u2019s hearing focused on Carson\u2019s long-standing antipathy toward social-welfare programs, with some senators asking him whether he, in fact, supports HUD\u2019s mission to provide housing assistance to millions of Americans. \u201cI think the rental assistance program is essential,\u201d Carson replied. He later, added, however that social programs have to operate within financial constraints.  Much of Carson\u2019s remarks focused on his well-documented background growing up poor in inner-city Detroit, saying he learned young what \u201chousing insecurity\u201d means. He provided few details in terms of U.S. housing policy or how he would revamp the agency, suggesting only that he was interested in making it more efficient. If confirmed as HUD secretary, Carson would oversee an agency with a roughly $40 billion budget that not only helps the poor but underwrites mortgage loans for middle-class families. HUD\u2019s Federal Housing Administration (FHA) stands behind roughly one in five home loans and at least $1.1 trillion in debt - a number that Carson said was troubling. Outgoing HUD Secretary Julian Castro this week slashed HUD fees for mortgage default insurance, which he said would save the average HUD-backed homeowner $500 a year. Carson suggested that he would consider reversing that surprise move. \u201cCertainly, if confirmed, I am going to work with the FHA administrator and other financial experts to really examine that policy,\u201d he said.

        "title": "Senator Franken, on groping allegations, vows 'this will not happen again'",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic Senator Al Franken returned to Congress on Monday to begin what he called a process of rebuilding trust shattered by allegations he had groped or inappropriately touched women, vowing \u201cthis will not happen again.\u201d \u201cI know that I am going to have to be much more conscious when in these circumstances, much more careful, much more sensitive and that this will not happen again going forward,\u201d he told reporters outside his office on Capitol Hill. Franken has been accused of sexual misconduct by Leann Tweeden, a radio broadcaster who in 2006 appeared with Franken in an entertainment tour for U.S. troops serving in war zones. Prior to winning his Senate seat, Franken was a well-known comedian, television writer and author. Another woman, Lindsay Menz, accused Franken of touching her buttocks when they were being photographed at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. A contrite Franken appeared on Monday before a throng of reporters gathered outside his office as the senator vowed to get back to work following a week-long Senate Thanksgiving break. \u201cI know there are no magic words that I can say to regain your trust and I know that\u2019s going to take time. I\u2019m ready to start that process and it starts with going back to work today,\u201d Franken said, apparently addressing his Minnesota constituents back home. Franken, first elected in 2008, is not due to run for a third Senate term until 2020. Following sexual misconduct allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein, additional complaints have been made regarding other big names in entertainment and in politics, notably Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama,                                                                           and Representative John Conyers of Michigan. All three men have denied the allegations, which Reuters has not been able to verify, and Conyers has stepped down as senior Democrat on the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.    In November, 2008, Franken barely won election in a race so close that it took vote recounts and court rulings before he finally was declared the winner the following July. Because of the closeness of his race and his background in entertainment and not government service, Franken came to the Senate refusing most media interviews. He kept a low profile while he tried to demonstrate to constituents that he was serious about his new political career. Eight years later, Franken is again having to prove himself with Minnesotans. Noting that his supporters had \u201ccounted on me to be a champion for women,\u201d Franken again apologized for his behavior. In response to a reporter\u2019s question, he said he would be \u201copen\u201d to making public the findings of a Senate ethics probe once that process is complete. ",

        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations has yet to determine whether violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar meets the legal definition of genocide, Jyoti Sanghera, Asia Pacific chief at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Wednesday. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein has called the situation  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing , but he has not used the word genocide.  We are yet looking at the legal boundaries of that,  Sanghera said.  It could meet the boundaries, but we haven t yet made that legal determination at OHCHR.  A U.N. team took witness statements from Rohingya refugees last month, and another human rights mission is currently on the ground, gathering evidence from some of the 582,000 Rohingya who have fled into Bangladesh in the last two months.  The testimony gathered by the team referred to unspeakable horrors,  Sanghera told an audience at Geneva s Graduate Institute.  Even as I speak this evening the world is witnessing a horrific spectacle of massive forced displacement and suffering.  A few hundred thousand Rohingya are thought to remain in Myanmar s northern Rakhine state, she said.  The refugees described massive detention and systematic rape by Myanmar security forces, deliberate destruction of Rohingya villages so that people could not return, and deliberate targeting of cultural and religious leaders that aimed to  diminish Rohingya history, culture and knowledge , she said. Imams had their beards shaved or burnt off, and women and girls were raped inside mosques. Some refugees said their non-Rohingya neighbors had been given weapons and uniforms and worked in concert with the security forces.  Unsettled post-colonial questions and tensions fueled by colonial powers of the past have been exploited by the military junta in Myanmar to keep ethnic rivalries simmering,  Sanghera said.   Systematic and acute discrimination of the Rohingya Muslims continues to be kept alive by the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, to a point referred to recently by the High Commissioner for Human Rights as  ethnic cleansing  of an entire people.  Designating the Rohingya as victims of genocide under a 1948 U.N. convention would increase pressure on the international community to take action to protect them, and could expose Myanmar officials to a greater threat of international justice. The U.N. convention, passed in the wake of the Nazi holocaust, requires countries to act to prevent and punish genocide, which it defines as any of a number of acts committed with the  intent to destroy, in whole or in part  a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. It is one of four categories of crimes subject to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in the Hague. ",

        "title": "Trump has a history of questionable behavior with women: NY Times",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Interviews with dozens of women who have worked for Donald Trump or interacted with him socially reveal a pattern of often unsettling personal behavior by the Republican presidential candidate, The New York Times reported on Saturday.  The Times, which said it based the article on more than 50 interviews, quoted women who recounted episodes in which he treated women as sexual objects and made comments about their bodies. But some women said Trump had encouraged them in their careers and promoted them within his businesses, often in positions in which women tended to be excluded. When asked about the unflattering incidents described in the article, Trump either denied that they took place or disputed the details, the newspaper said. \u201cA lot of things get made up over the years,\u201d Trump told the Times. \u201cI have always treated women with great respect.\u201d A Trump representative did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment. Barbara Res, who oversaw construction of Trump\u2019s Manhattan business headquarters, said he would sometimes interrupt meetings with comments about women\u2019s figures.  During a job interview for a Los Angeles project, for example, Trump made a random aside about Southern California women. \u201cThey take care of their asses,\u201d Res recalled Trump saying. Years later, when Res says she had gained weight, she said Trump told her: \u201cYou like your candy.\u201d Even so, Res, who worked for Trump for 12 years before quitting and then came back as a consultant for six more, said she was grateful to Trump for her professional opportunities, though she said he frequently called her \u201cHoney Bunch,\u201d the Times reported.   Trump also earned a reputation for being seen with beautiful women dating back to his days at a New York military-style boarding school where he was named \u201cladies\u2019 man\u201d in the yearbook, the Times reported.   Barbara Fife, a deputy New York mayor in the 1990s, recalls Trump telling her at her City Hall office that he was in a hurry because he had \u201ca great date tonight with a model for Victoria\u2019s Secret,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cI saw it as immature, quite honestly,\u201d Fife was quoted as saying. As a candidate, Trump has made frequent references to his record in business as evidence of how American women would benefit if he is elected. He has often said that no one \u201ccherishes\u201d or \u201crespects\u201d women more than him.\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some of those interviewed praised Trump for giving women positions of power. \u201cI think there are mischaracterizations about him,\u201d Jill Martin, assistant counsel at the Trump Organization, told the Times. \u201cFor me, he\u2019s made it a situation where I can really excel at my job and still devote the time necessary for my family.\u201d The story comes less than two weeks after the last of Trump\u2019s Republican rivals dropped out, all but assuring him the party\u2019s presidential nomination this summer.  Throughout his improbable campaign, Trump has managed to deflect criticism about his attitude to women, fueled by verbal insults he lobbed at Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and former Republican candidate Carly Fiorina.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said in a commencement speech on Saturday that U.S. race relations have improved over the last three decades, but that significant work still needs to be done. \u201cI tell you this not to lull you into complacency, but to spur you into action because there\u2019s still so much work to do,\u201d Obama told about 2,300 Howard University graduates in Washington, acknowledging that racism and inequality still persist. \u201cWe cannot sleepwalk through life,\u201d he said. The United States has faced a number of racial controversies in recent years, including the 2014 shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, that sparked sometimes violent protests. The United States has a racial gap in economic opportunities, Obama said, noting that the overall U.S. employment rate is around 5 percent, but it is near 9 percent for African-Americans. Obama, the son of a white mother and African father, told the graduates to embrace their racial identity. \u201cBe confident in your blackness,\u201d Obama said, adding \u201cthere is no one way to be black ... There\u2019s no straightjacket, there\u2019s no constraints, there\u2019s no litmus test for authenticity.\u201d He added that \u201cmy election did not create a post-racial society,\u201d but was one example of how attitudes have changed. Obama also urged the crowd not to try to prod colleges and universities into disinviting controversial speakers - something that has taken place regularly at campuses throughout the United States. Howard University is one of about 100 historically black colleges and universities in the United States. Obama argued that the United States and the world has progressed dramatically since 1983 when he graduated from college. \u201cAmerica is by almost every measure better than it was\u201d in 1983, Obama said, noting that U.S. poverty rate is down, the number of people with college degrees is up and the number of women in the workforce have risen. Obama said today\u2019s college graduates are better positioned than any other to address the country\u2019s tough outstanding problems. \u201cYou need a strategy,\u201d Obama said, adding passion and anger are not enough to effect political change and encouraging them to embrace compromise. \u201cNot just hashtags but votes.\u201d He noted the low voter turnout among young people in the 2014 congressional elections. He told the graduates they needed to vote \u201cevery time ... not just when you\u2019re inspired.\u201d But Obama noted an area that has not improved in recent decades - the U.S. prison population - currently at 2.2 million, it is up more than fourfold from 500,000 in 1983. African-American men are six times more likely than white men to be incarcerated, Obama said, and urged the graduates to lobby the U.S. Congress to pass a pending criminal justice reform measure. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, praised Obama\u2019s remarks on Twitter, writing \u201ceven conservatives would applaud it.\u201d ",

        "title": "A new worry for Clinton: Trump's struggles may depress Democratic voter turnout",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is confronting an emerging risk to her presidential ambitions - if Donald Trump continues to trail her in opinion polls many Democrats may simply stay at home on Election Day. Without enough popular support, Clinton would enter the White House lacking the political capital she would need to drive through her agenda. In the worst-case scenario it could cost her the presidency if Republicans turn out in big numbers on Nov. 8.      Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has spent much of her campaign sounding the alarm over the prospect of a President Trump. She has struggled to lay out a compelling vision for her presidency and has failed to excite key constituencies, including millennials, minority voters and liberal Democrats. Opinion polls show that many voters are backing Clinton primarily to stop Trump, the Republican nominee, from getting into the White House. If they believe he has no hope of winning, then what would their motivation be to turn up at the polls?  In a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll about half of all Clinton supporters said they were backing her to keep Trump from winning. By contrast, just 36.5 percent said it was because of Clinton\u2019s policies and just 12.6 percent said it was because they like her personally.  \u201cTurnout is correlated with levels of competition,\u201d said Michael McDonald, an elections expert at the University of Florida. \u201cThe higher the competition, the higher the turnout.\u201d The young Americans, blacks, Latinos, and low-income voters who make up much of the Democratic base often need to feel motivated by a particular candidate or issue to turn out, McDonald said, as was the case with President Barack Obama\u2019s candidacy in 2008.  Clinton\u2019s campaign has long worried about voter complacency and has at every turn pushed the notion that the race is close and that Trump is unfit to be president. With her lead growing, that task grows more difficult. A Reuters/Ipsos 50-state survey (carried out before Friday\u2019s release of a video tape in which Trump makes vulgar remarks about women) gave the Democratic nominee a 95 percent chance of winning the election. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll on Monday showed Clinton with an 11-point lead nationally over Trump. Low Democratic voter turnout could leave Trump an opening in swing states. And should Clinton win the election, a slim margin of victory could compound the challenge she will face in trying to govern a deeply divided nation.  Clinton\u2019s campaign, however, will be able to rely on an extensive and well-funded voter mobilization effort, one that is expected to give her an edge over Trump\u2019s smaller organization.  The Clinton campaign insisted on Monday the race will remain tight. It sent out a new fundraising pitch to supporters, contending that Trump is \u201can authoritarian threat\u201d for saying at Sunday\u2019s presidential debate that she would be in jail if he was president.  Clinton must also contend with anger among liberal Democrats over leaked excerpts of paid speeches she made to banks and big business. The excerpts appeared to confirm their fears about her support for global trade and tendency to cozy up to Wall Street. Some liberals have also been waiting for Clinton to make a more positive case for her own presidency. \u201cThis election cannot be just a referendum on Donald Trump,\u201d said Arun Chaudhury, creative director of Revolution Messaging, a left-leaning consulting firm that oversaw the online media operation of former Clinton rival, Senator Bernie Sanders.  Clinton\u2019s central message, he said, has been that \u201ceveryone has to step up and stop Donald Trump from being president, not step up and make Hillary Clinton president.\u201d  \u201cThe best campaign messages are comparative in nature,\u201d said Ben Turchin, a Democratic pollster who worked for Sanders\u2019 campaign. \u201cShe can win by a bigger margin by giving a little more of an affirmative case for her presidency.\u201d While Clinton frequently goes on the attack against Trump, calling him racist, sexist and dangerous, her campaign insists it has been trying to get a positive, policy-oriented message out. \u201cIt is hard in this campaign when you\u2019re running against him and he generates so much controversy and therefore headlines,\u201d Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton\u2019s communications director, told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to break through on any one day, and that\u2019s why we just have to keep at it.\u201d The two candidates\u2019 central campaign slogans reflect their differing appeals to the electorate. Where Trump\u2019s is the change-oriented \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d Clinton\u2019s is a more stolid \u201cStronger Together,\u201d which speaks to rallying existing Democratic voters around her candidacy - and is a harder sell.  Clinton\u2019s campaign seems to have recognized the need for some adjustments to its message.  Since the presidential race intensified last month, Clinton has returned to the style of campaigning that helped her win early states in the Democratic nominating contests, holding smallish events focused on issues of most concern to core Democratic constituencies such as women and young voters.  Turchin, the former Sanders pollster, said Clinton\u2019s efforts at fashioning a positive message were improving, although she is still having difficulty attracting the support of 18-to-34 year-old voters, among others.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make the hard case over and over again,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s got to convince people she shares their values.\u201d ",

        "text": "SOCHI, Russia (Reuters) - The size of Russia s military force in Syria is likely to be significantly reduced and a drawdown could start before the end of the year, the chief of the Russian military general staff said on Thursday. Russia s military support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, notably through air strikes, has been crucial in defeating Islamic State and Syrian opposition forces.  There is very little left to do before the completion of military objectives. Of course, a decision will be made by the supreme commander-in-chief and the deployment will be reduced,  Valery Gerasimov told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and military top brass in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Gerasimov said forces would likely be  substantially  reduced but leave Russia with two military bases, a ceasefire-monitoring center and  a number of necessary structures to support the situation which has developed  in Syria.   Putin hosted Assad in Sochi on Monday and discussed moving from military operations to a search for a political solution to Syria s conflict. [nL8N1NR0K3] On Wednesday, Putin won the backing of Turkey and Iran to host a Syrian peace conference, taking the central role in a major diplomatic push to finally end Syria s civil war, now in its seventh year. [nL8N1NS5RQ] In March last year Putin said Russia had achieved its goals in Syria and ordered the withdrawal of the  main part  of its forces. However, a U.S.-led coalition operating in Syria said that after that statement Russia s combat power was largely intact. ",

        "title": "Instead of U.S. midterms, Sanders focuses on smaller races",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders will focus on getting liberal candidates elected to state and local offices ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections rather than on higher-profile U.S. congressional races, to help build a national progressive movement from the ground up. Sanders said he hoped his emphasis on school boards, city councils and statehouses will help support the next generation of activist progressive candidates and dovetail with the mission of Our Revolution, a nonprofit political group run by former staffers and volunteers for his 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cI look at politics a little bit differently than some of my colleagues in the sense that I believe that we need to build a national grassroots movement,\u201d Sanders told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cSo I think my emphasis is going to be more on grassroots politics,\u201d he added. Sanders, an independent in the U.S. Senate, galvanized the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing last year with his primary challenge against eventual nominee Hillary Clinton.  Sanders, 76, drew huge crowds and won 43 percent of Democratic primary voters with his calls to end the influence of big money in politics, create Medicare-for all healthcare and establish free tuition at public universities. Democrats are arguing over the best way out of a deep electoral rut capped by Clinton\u2019s presidential election defeat by Republican Donald Trump. The party lost nearly 1,000 state legislative seats nationally during former President Barack Obama\u2019s two terms in the White House, and hold the fewest governor\u2019s offices in nearly a century. \u201cThere is an absolute need for the development of a new generation of leadership,\u201d said Democratic strategist Erik Smith, adding that current Republican victories are the result of grassroots investment in the 1980s. Sanders said the type of progressive policies he espoused during his campaign are winning support around the country.  He traveled to Georgia last month to campaign for Vincent Fort, a state senator running for Atlanta mayor. Sanders called Fort, who supports a $15 per hour minimum wage and the expansion of the Medicaid health insurance program for the poor and disabled, a \u201clife-long progressive.\u201d Sanders also pointed to the success of local candidates backed by Our Revolution, including Randall Woodfin, a school board president who triumphed in a crowded field to oust the incumbent Democratic mayor of Birmingham, Alabama, and Chokwe Antar Lumumba, who defeated an incumbent and a state senator to become the Democratic nominee for mayor in Jackson, Mississippi. \u201cDemocrats suffer from thin-bench syndrome in so many states,\u201d said Matt Barron, a Massachusetts Democratic strategist focusing on rural issues.  Barron pointed out that in Mississippi, just one of eight statewide offices is held by a Democrat and both chambers of the legislature are controlled by Republicans. \u201cThere is almost nobody to run,\u201d he said. Sanders said he plans to travel to Somerville, Massachusetts, next week to support a half dozen candidates in city council races. \u201cIf you look at cities and town and school boards, what you see all over the country is that we are in fact making progress,\u201d Sanders said. While Sanders frequently exasperated Clinton and her supporters, his policy prescriptions won support from many Democrats and the party has shifted to the left since Clinton\u2019s defeat. Many potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates back Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-all proposal.     Republicans hold 52 seats in the 100-member U.S. Senate, and Democrats and independents will be defending 25 of the 34 seats up for re-election in 2018. In the U.S. House of Representatives, Democrats hold 194 of 435 seats and all are up for re-election next year. ",

        "text": "XIAMEN, China (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that imposing tougher sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear missile programme would be counter-productive and said threats of military action could trigger  a global catastrophe . Putin, speaking after a BRICs summit in China, criticised U.S. diplomacy in the crisis and renewed his call for talks, saying Pyongyang would not halt its missile testing programme until it felt secure.  Russia condemns North Korea s exercises, we consider that they are a provocation ... (But) ramping up military hysteria will lead to nothing good. It could lead to a global catastrophe,  he told reporters.  There s no other path apart from a peaceful one.  Putin was speaking after South Korea said an agreement with the United States to scrap a weight limit on its warheads would help it respond to the North Korea threat after Pyongyang conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test two days ago. Russia, which shares a border with North Korea, has repeatedly joined China in calling for negotiations with Pyongyang, suggesting that the United States and South Korea halt all major war games in exchange for North Korea halting its testing programme. While describing additional sanctions as  the road to nowhere , Putin said Russia was prepared to discuss  some details  around the issue, without elaborating. The Russian leader also lashed out at the United States, saying it was preposterous for Washington to ask for Moscow s help with North Korea after sanctioning Russian companies whom U.S officials accused of violating North Korea sanctions.  It s ridiculous to put us on the same (sanctions) list as North Korea and then ask for our help in imposing sanctions on North Korea,  said Putin.  This is being done by people who mix up Australia with Austria,  he added. The United States has floated the idea of requiring all countries to cut economic links with North Korea to try to strong-arm Pyongyang into changing its behaviour.  In Moscow s case, that would mean stopping using North Korean labourers, tens of thousands of whom work in Russia, and halting fuel supplies to Pyongyang. Russia has so far refused to contemplate doing either.   ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than half of the registered lobbyists in Washington have worked on tax issues in 2017, a report showed on Friday, as lawmakers in the U.S. capital scramble to conclude a year-long effort to pass a tax reform bill before Christmas. About 6,200 lobbyists, or 57 percent of those who reported activity in 2017, have been listed on disclosure forms as working on issues involving \u201ctax\u201d this year, the advocacy group Public Citizen said in the report. Twenty companies and trade groups each hired 50 lobbyists to work on tax issues, the report said, with U.S. Chamber of Commerce hiring 100 and the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives at big U.S. companies, employing 51 lobbyists. The Republican bill would be the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the 1980s and its ultimate shape and success are crucial to U.S. corporate profits over the next 10 years. As drafted, the Senate bill would cut the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent after a one-year delay and reduce taxes for some businesses and individuals, while ending many tax breaks. Democrats have been united in their opposition to the bill, calling it a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations. U.S. companies have a vested interest in nearly every aspect of the Republican tax plan, saying they would use a tax reform windfall to buy back shares, retire debt or invest back into their business.[nL1N1NQ15C} Five large U.S. companies have hired at least 15 lobbying firms for tax issues in 2017, the report said.

        "title": "U.S. signals caution to Saudis despite shared concern about Iran",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Despite President Donald Trump s full-throated support for Saudi Arabia, the United States appears to be signaling a desire for Riyadh to take a more cautious approach in its regional power struggle with Iran, experts say. The Trump administration, which shares Saudi Arabia s view of Iran as a regional menace, has strongly backed the Kingdom in the wake of a failed missile attack from Iran-aligned forces in Yemeni territory that demonstrated an ability to strike the Saudi capital. Trump has cultivated much warmer ties with the Saudis after a fraught relationship with the Obama administration - the president made Riyadh his first stop on his maiden international trip - and has vowed to take strong action to confront Iran. Nevertheless, Washington, which has U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq, is telegraphing a more tempered stance toward the confrontation in a region beset with turmoil.  On Thursday, the State Department called for  unimpeded access  for humanitarian aid to Yemen, after Saudi Arabia imposed a blockade on the country to stem the flow of arms to Iran-aligned Houthi fighters.  A day later, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made clear he still recognized as Lebanon s prime minister Saad al-Hariri, who unexpectedly announced his resignation on Nov. 4 from Riyadh. In announcing his decision on television, Hariri said he feared assassination and accused Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world, thrusting Lebanon into the front line of the competition between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran.  Two U.S. officials said the Saudis, led by Crown Prince Mohammed, had  encouraged  Hariri to leave office and Lebanese officials say he is being held in Saudi Arabia, a charge Riyadh denies. Hariri has not commented publicly on whether he is free to come and go as he pleases. In a statement on Saturday, the White House said it  rejects any efforts by militias within Lebanon or by any foreign forces to threaten Lebanon s stability...or use Lebanon as a base from which to threaten others in the region.  When asked to comment on whether the United States was pushing for a more cautious Saudi response, both the White House and State Department referred to Saturday s statement on Lebanon. Tillerson was  not going along with the Saudi position in describing the Lebanese state as under capture by Hezbollah,   said Paul Salem, the senior vice president of the Middle East Institute, a Washington think tank.  That s significant.   Tillerson was also  signaling to the Israelis ... that now is not the time to go after Lebanon,  said Salem, referring to long-standing Israeli concerns about Hezbollah s growing military prowess. Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said he believed the Trump administration was still seeking to help the Saudis advance their interests against Iran without destabilizing the region.  This is a delicate balancing act. It involves supporting allies in a policy that the administration agrees with, while trying to mitigate aspects of it that it (sees as) overstated,  Takeyh said. Tillerson s statement also urged  all parties both within Lebanon and outside  to respect Lebanon s independence and said there was no role for any foreign forces. The United States regularly criticizes Iran and Hezbollah for their role in Lebanon. Tillerson s backing of Hariri and the Lebanese government contrasted sharply with the approach taken by Saudi Arabia, which has lumped Lebanon with Hezbollah as parties hostile to it.  I see Rex Tillerson as being an old fashioned American diplomat and old fashioned American diplomacy in the Middle East is all about stability,  said F. Gregory Gause, chairman of the International Affairs Department at Texas A&M University.  I m not entirely sure that that is the position of the chief executive of the United States,  Gause added. The Saudi actions coincide with an anti-corruption purge by the country s future king that tightened his grip on power. Trump tweeted on Monday that he had  great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia  following the mass arrests - the biggest such purge of the kingdom s affluent elite in its modern history. Trump also tweeted that  they know exactly what they are doing.   Former and current U.S. officials with deep knowledge of Saudi Arabia say Trump s enthusiastic support for Prince Mohammed has emboldened the youthful Saudi leader. Tillerson told reporters the purge appeared  well intended  but the mass arrests, which have swept up officials long known in Washington, also fueled U.S. concerns.  It raises a few concerns until we see more clearly how these particular individuals are dealt with,  Tillerson added. Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the president s senior adviser, who has cultivated a close relationship with Prince Mohammed, recently returned from Saudi Arabia, fueling speculation on whether he may have had wind of the Crown Prince s plans. A senior administration official said they had no advance knowledge. ",

        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - Air strikes by the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen have killed at least 136 civilians and non-combatants since Dec. 6, the U.N. human rights spokesman said on Tuesday. Other U.N. officials said the coalition was maintaining tight restrictions on ships reaching Yemen even though 8 million Yemenis are on the brink of famine with the country relying on imports for the bulk of its food, fuel and medicine.  We are deeply concerned at the recent surge in civilian casualties in Yemen as a result of intensified air strikes by the ... coalition, following the killing of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh in Sanaa on Dec. 4,  human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a news briefing.  Incidents verified by the U.N. human rights office included seven air strikes on a prison in the Shaub district of Sanaa on Dec. 13 that killed at least 45 detainees thought to be loyal to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who is backed by Saudi Arabia.  One can assume that was a mistake, they weren t intending to kill prisoners from their own side,  Colville said.  It s an illustration of lack of due precaution.  Other air strikes killed 14 children and six adults in a farmhouse in Hodeidah governorate on Dec. 15, as well as a woman and nine children returning from a wedding party in Marib governorate on Dec. 16, he said. Air strikes verified by the U.N. rights office in Sanaa, Saada, Hodeidah and Taiz governorates also injured 87 civilians.  If in a specific event due precaution is not taken or civilians are deliberately targeted, that can easily be a war crime,  Colville said.  It is up to a court to make a ruling, he said, but there had been so many similar incidents in Yemen, it would be hard to conclude war crimes had not taken place. On Tuesday Saudi air defenses intercepted a ballistic missile fired towards the capital Riyadh but there were no reports of casualties, the coalition said, the latest in a series of attacks by the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen. The restrictions on access to Yemen imposed by the coalition became a total blockade on Nov. 6 though conditions were eased on Nov. 25 to allow aid ships and some commercial cargoes to reach the shattered Arabian Peninsula country. The U.N. World Food Programme has brought in enough food for 1.8 million people for two months, but far more is needed. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Bernie Sanders\u2019 Democratic presidential campaign has sued Ohio\u2019s secretary of state in federal court over what it calls an unconstitutional attempt to prevent young people from voting in the state\u2019s March 15 primary election. \u201cIt is an outrage that the secretary of state in Ohio is going out of his way to keep young people \u2013 significantly African-American young people, Latino young people \u2013 from participating,\u201d the U.S. senator from Vermont said in a statement released on Tuesday. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Columbus and  joined by six Ohio 17-year-olds, alleged that a directive by Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted would \u201carbitrarily discriminate\u201d against young voters. Citing U.S. Census figures, it said such voters were more likely to be black or Latino than older groups of voters. Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 election, has attracted support from young voters but has lagged behind rival Hillary Clinton in winning votes among minorities. Ohio is one of more than 20 states where 17-year-olds who will be 18 by the time of the general election are allowed to vote in primaries, the campaign statement said. Husted ruled last December that those voters would not be allowed to participate in the presidential primary. He denied there had been any changes to voting rules.  \u201cWe are following the same rules Ohio has operated under in past primaries, under both Democrat and Republican administrations. There is nothing new here,\u201d Husted said on Twitter. \u201cIf you are going to be 18 by the November election, you can vote, just not on every issue.\u201d  He said that 17-year-olds were \u201cnot permitted to elect candidates, which is what voters are doing in a primary when they elect delegates to represent them at their political party\u2019s national convention.\u201d         (Reporting by Eric Walsh in Washington; Editing by Peter Cooney) This article was funded in part by SAP.

Current RNC Chairman Reince Priebus has been tapped to serve as Trump\u2019s chief of staff when he starts his White House term Jan. 20, 2017. Christie had launched a presidential bid alongside Trump in a pool of 17 candidates that eventually saw Trump, a New York businessman who had never held political office, win the nomination as well as the Nov. 8 presidential election over Democrat Hillary Clinton.  Christie had been a rising political star before the so-called \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal involving his former top aides that left his reputation in tatters.   Pence took over from Christie, who at one time had been considered a possible candidate to serve as Trump\u2019s attorney general, a post that instead went to U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. Trump\u2019s team has said Christie would remain as vice chair of the transition effort. Earlier this month, Christie\u2019s two former aides were convicted for shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in 2013, creating a days-long traffic jam. The scheme was intended to punish the town\u2019s mayor, a Democrat, for declining to endorse Christie\u2019s reelection campaign. ",

        "text": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A little-known Chinese elevator maker saw its Shenzhen-listed shares surge the maximum 10 percent on Wednesday. The reason? The company s name resembles that of Wang Huning, a Chinese Communist Party theoretician who was elevated on Wednesday to China s apex of power.  The frenzied buying in Hangzhou Huning Elevator Parts Co, whose business has nothing to do with Wang, offers the latest example of the enduring influence of short-term speculators, despite regulators  stepped-up campaign against  pump and dump  trading. The government is introducing more foreign institutional investors, hoping they can help improve the trading culture in the country s stock market - sometimes likened to a casino. U.S. index publisher MSCI will include China A-shares in its global indexes next year. But Wednesday s surge in Huning Elevator shows that many investors still pick stocks merely by name, not fundamentals.  This is pure speculation, spurred by irrational euphoria. It has nothing to do with fundamentals,  said Yang Hai, analyst at Kaiyuan Securities.  Heady investors who chased the stock will be burnt.       Trading in Huning Elevator was calm in the morning, but that changed after the Communist Party revealed around midday its new Politburo Standing Committee, the country s top policy-making body. The seven-man unit included Wang, a one-time law professor from Shanghai who has risen steadily up the party s ranks but mostly operated behind the scenes. When the stock resumed trading in the afternoon, a buying spree pushed it up the maximum 10 percent. It gave up some gains in afternoon trading and closed up 6 percent. The elevator maker, which cannot be immediately reached for comment, forecast roughly flat nine-month profit on Oct. 13. Name-based stock-picking is not uncommon in China, especially during major political events. Last November, when news headlines pointed to a likely presidential election win for Donald Trump, shares in Wisesoft Co Ltd - whose Chinese name sounds like  Trump s big win  - surged, while Yunan Xiyi Industrial- whose Chinese name bears resemblance to  Aunt Hillary  - slumped. And when Barack Obama won the U.S. presidential election in 2008, speculators piled into home appliances maker Aucma Co Ltd, which sounds roughly like the Chinese pronunciation of Obama. Some listed firms in China even took advantage of speculators  preference for sexy names. In 2015, property developer Shanghai Duolun Industry changed its name to P2P Financial Information Services Co, in an apparent attempt to tap into investors  mania toward fin tech at the time, triggering a surge in its shares, before the bubble burst.

        "title": "Trump's NAFTA revamp would require concessions, may borrow from TPP",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s plan to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to make it \u201ca lot better\u201d for U.S. workers would not be a one-way street for his administration, as Canada and Mexico prepare their own list of demands that could require difficult U.S. concessions. The 22-year-old NAFTA and other trade deals became lightning rods for voter anger in the U.S. industrial heartland states that swept Trump to power this month.  Trump \u2014 who on Monday vowed to file notice of his intent to quit an Asia-Pacific trade deal on his first day in office \u2014 has pledged to leave NAFTA if it can\u2019t be improved to his liking. But he has said little about what improvements he wants, apart from halting the migration of U.S. factories and jobs to Mexico. Trade experts, academics and government officials say Canada and Mexico would also seek tough concessions and that NAFTA\u2019s zero-tariff rate would be extremely difficult to alter. And any renegotiation would likely take several years. \u201cIn a renegotiation, one side can come in with requests, but the other side is going to expect concessions,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, a former deputy U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). \u201cWe need to know what we\u2019re going to ask for and what we can give.\u201d When Cutler helped renegotiate a stalled trade deal with South Korea in 2010, USTR won concessions for U.S. automakers, but at the expense of a longer phase-out on steep Korean pork tariffs and allowing Korea to largely maintain a health care reimbursement system that favors domestic generic drugmakers. Trump, who during the campaign called NAFTA the \u201cworst trade deal ever\u201d and threatened to levy a 35-percent tariff on Mexican-assembled autos and other goods, would have a hard time raising U.S. tariffs without scrapping the agreement, trade experts say. \u201cThere is no precedent in free trade negotiations for one side raising tariffs more than the other,\u201d said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington. \u201cIf U.S. workers are more expensive than Mexican workers, the only way to level the playing field is to do things that raise costs in Mexico,\u201d Bown said.   Negotiating stronger environmental and labor protections would be one way of doing this, as it would increase manufacturing costs in a lower-income country like Mexico. The Trump transition leader for trade, Dan Dimicco, declined Reuters\u2019 requests for comment. DiMicco, who is under consideration to be Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, is a former chief executive of steel giant Nucor Corp. who has long fought for protections against unfairly traded imports. In a YouTube video message published on Monday, Trump vowed to quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a proposed 12-country Pacific-rim trade bloc. Although the TPP terms were settled more than a year ago, the pact was never taken up by U.S. Republican leaders in Congress due in part to anti-free-trade rhetoric in the presidential campaign. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Calling it a \u201ca potential disaster for our country\u201d, Trump said his administration would instead negotiate \u201cfair, bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto American shores.\u201d  His comments would appear to snuff out any hopes among other TPP countries that the pact championed by President Barack Obama could be revived under the new administration. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said at a Pacific Rim summit on Saturday that he would be willing to discuss NAFTA with Trump to \u201cmodernize\u201d the treaty \u2014 but not renegotiate existing provisions. He said that modernization could include adding environmental, labor and other provisions that weren\u2019t contemplated when NAFTA was being negotiated in the early 1990s. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who met with Pena Nieto on the APEC sidelines, said he was \u201ckeeping our options open\u201d on trade discussions with the U.S. president-elect.    But if NAFTA is reopened, Canada will insist that any renegotiation bring an end to a decades-old dispute over Canadian exports of softwood lumber, said David MacNaughton, Canada\u2019s ambassador to the United States. U.S. producers claim the Canadian wood is unfairly subsidized because it comes from federal lands and have threatened to seek billions of dollars in tariffs, which Canadian officials say would make a \u201cmockery\u201d of free trade. For Mexico\u2019s part, any concessions that would favor U.S. industrial goods could be met with demands to increase U.S. import quotas for Mexican sugar and protections for Mexico\u2019s potato crop. And both Mexico and Canada would likely demand greater access to compete for U.S. public sector procurements, now largely protected by \u201cBuy America\u201d laws. A major Trump administration infrastructure spending program would make this a more enticing target, Cutler said. Since NAFTA was enacted, total U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico has quadrupled to $1.3 trillion a year, but the U.S. combined goods trade deficit with Canada and Mexico has grown from $9.1 billion in 1993 to $76.2 billion in 2015. (Graphic showing trend in U.S. trade deficit, imports: tmsnrt.rs/2gajLSa) NAFTA\u2019s effect on U.S. jobs is disputed. Critics such as the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute charge that it has led to the loss of some 850,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs, while proponents such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce claim the trade growth has added a net 5 million jobs in the United States.   The non-partisan Congressional Research Service concluded that NAFTA has had only a small positive effect on U.S. growth, but has helped U.S. manufacturers become more competitive due to more efficient supply chains.      A renegotiated NAFTA could, ironically, end up borrowing key elements from the TPP to stiffen provisions on environment, labor and digital economy standards, trade experts said. Mexico and Canada have already agreed in the TPP to \u201cfully enforceable\u201d labor and environmental improvements, meaning that punitive duties could be imposed on countries that don\u2019t comply \u2014 a major step-up from NAFTA. TPP also included provisions governing e-commerce and cross-border data flows \u2014 sectors that barely existed as NAFTA was negotiated in the early 1990s \u2014 to better protect intellectual property and ensure a free and open internet. Officials in all three countries say NAFTA needs modernization in this area. Trump economic advisers Peter Navarro and Wilbur Ross have suggested, however, that the TPP environmental, health and safety standards aren\u2019t strong enough.  In an economic white paper and various opinion pieces, Navarro, a University of California-Irvine business professor and Ross, a billionaire private equity investor who is being considered by Trump to lead the Commerce Department, said they want future U.S. trade deals to include \u201cprompt triggers and automatic renegotiation if trade gains are not distributed fairly.\u201d They also want \u201cironclad sanctions\u201d against currency manipulation, and \u201czero tolerance\u201d for intellectual property theft. \u201cIn any negotiation or renegotiation, our guiding principle should be this: Enter into a free trade agreement only if it both increases total trade and reduces our trade deficit,\u201d they wrote.

        "title": "'It's not over yet,' Merkel warns supporters before vote",
        "text": "HAMBURG (Reuters) - Returning to her birthplace, Chancellor Angela Merkel urged supporters to mobilize undecided voters before Sunday s election, telling them not to take her conservatives  solid lead in opinion polls for granted. Surveys show many voters are still undecided and, with the election likely to return a fractured parliament, she wants to maximize support to bolster her position in coalition negotiations.  What I ve heard in the last days is unbelievable ... that everything is already decided,  the 63-year-old told a crowd of several hundred packed into the Fish Auction Hall in Hamburg.  It is not. Every vote counts!  Noting that the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), her closest rivals, have not ruled out a left-wing coalition with the Left party and the environmentalist Greens - a tie-up untested at national level - Merkel added:  We live in turbulent times. We can t afford any experiments.    In these times, we need stability and security, and a clear path, both at home and abroad,  she said. Before Merkel spoke in Hamburg, a band pumped up the crowd, belting out  Celebration  by Kool & The Gang and Bryan Adams   Summer Of  69 . One or two greying supporters stood up and danced. SPD leader Martin Schulz told broadcaster RTL he believed there could still be a last-minute swing in his party s favor.  The experience of all elections, national or international, show that the number of undecided people is growing more and more,  Schulz said.  Everything is still possible.  A win for him would be against the run of the opinion polls. On Tuesday, a weekly survey conducted by Forsa showed support for Merkel s CDU/CSU bloc - known as the  Union  - at 36 percent, its lowest since April, but still far ahead of the SPD, on 23 percent. Attention in Germany is largely turning to who Merkel will govern with after the election, rather than whether she will stay in power. Latest surveys suggest that only another grand coalition of Merkel s conservatives with the SPD or a nationwide untested three-way  Jamaica  alliance of the conservatives, FDP and Greens would have a stable majority. A coalition involving the FDP could limit her room for maneuver on pressing ahead with euro zone reform. Without detailing how she wanted to develop the EU, Merkel delivered an impassioned defense of the European project, saying she regretted Britons  vote to leave the bloc.  I could stand here and talk for hours about how arduous Europe often is,  she said, before adding:  It always is worth standing up for Europe, even just because it gives us peace and freedom.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said on Thursday the company was committed to helping U.S. congressional investigators publicly release Russia-backed political ads that ran during the 2016 U.S. election. \u201cThings happened on our platform in this election that should not have happened,\u201d Sandberg said in an interview in Washington with Axios news that was broadcast on its website. \u201cWe told Congress and the intelligence committees that when they are ready to release the ads, we are ready to help them.\u201d Axios asked Sandberg what the world\u2019s largest social network knew about the extent of Russia\u2019s use of its platform and if ads on Facebook that had been placed by Russian accounts and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign had overlapped in terms of target audiences. She appeared to sidestep the questions and said only that targeting on Facebook was often very broad.  The interview was the first by a senior Facebook executive since the company disclosed last month that it had found some 3,000 politically divisive ads believed to have been bought by Russia before and after the presidential campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia used cyber-enabled means in an attempt to help Trump win the White House, an allegation the Kremlin has denied. Sandberg was in Washington for meetings with U.S. lawmakers.  Sandberg told the Congressional Black Caucus on Thursday that Facebook planned to add an African-American to its board of directors, a source familiar with the closed-door meeting said, but she offered no details. The board has been criticized for its lack of diversity.  She and two other Facebook executives, Erin Egan and Elliot Schrage, also met privately with Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee. Facebook and other major internet companies including Alphabet\u2019s Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) are on the defensive as they try to limit fallout from a torrent of  revelations about how Moscow sought to use their platforms to sow discord in the United States and influence the election. Sandberg told Axios that Facebook began hearing rumors around Election Day last November of Russian attempts to use the platform to spread propaganda but did not give a precise timeline about when the company began its review. Sandberg said she supported the public release of those ads, and the pages to which they were connected. Information about how the ads targeted specific types of users would also be released, she said. Asked if Facebook contributed to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat last year, Sandberg, an open Clinton supporter during the campaign, did not answer directly but said it was important the website was \u201cfree from abuse\u201d during any election in any country. Congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller are investigating Russian interference in the election, including whether there was any collusion between Trump associates and Moscow. Trump has denied that there was any collusion between his campaign and associates and Russia. Sandberg acknowledged that the company had erred in how it handled the issue of foreign interference last year. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that we apologize. We\u2019re angry, we\u2019re upset. But what we really owe the American people is determination to do a better job of preventing foreign meddling,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this kind of foreign interference\u201d on Facebook, Sandberg said.  She said the company had been too permissive at times in terms of how advertisers were allowed to target users. Sandberg said it was important to protect \u201cfree expression\u201d on Facebook and that if the Russian ads had been bought by legitimate accounts instead of fraudulent ones, many would have been allowed to run on the site. She criticized Twitter\u2019s decision this week to remove a campaign video from Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee. Twitter took down the video, saying a remark Blackburn made about opposing abortion was inflammatory. Twitter later reversed its decision. \u201cIn that ad, there are a lot of things that people don\u2019t like, that I don\u2019t like. ... But the question is, \u2018Should divisive political or issue ads run?\u2019 Our answer is yes because when you cut off speech for one person you cut off speech for all people,\u201d she said. Sandberg said Facebook wanted other internet companies to work toward making ad purchases more transparent, and she said  Facebook was talking with lawmakers who want to introduce legislation on the issue. Representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are expected to testify about Russian influence at hearings before the Senate and House intelligence committees on Nov. 1. ",

The EU executive believes the law, passed in June, violates the right to freedom of association and to protection of private life and personal data enshrined in the EU s Charter of Fundamental Rights, as well as breaching the principle of free movement of capital. Hungary s right-wing prime minister, Viktor Orban, has long criticized organizations funded by the Hungarian-born Soros, accusing them of working as paid activists advocating Soros s political goals, notably by opposing Orban s tough immigration policy. When Soros in June praised the  courageous way Hungarians have resisted the deception and corruption of the mafia state Orban has established , Orban called it a  declaration of war , and accused Soros of running a mafia-like network. The Commission expressed its concerns over the law on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to Budapest in July, the latest in a long line of grievances about what Brussels and many member states see as a track record of flouting fundamental EU values.  Having carefully analyzed the explanations put forward by Hungary, the European Commission concludes that its serious concerns have not been addressed,  it said in Wednesday s statement. The Commission s next step in the  infringement procedure  is to issue a so-called reasoned opinion, giving Hungary one month to take the requested measures.  If Hungary fails to reply satisfactorily to the reasoned opinion, then the Commission may refer the case to the Court of Justice of the EU,  the statement said. The Commission has already issued a similar ultimatum to Hungary over an education law that Brussels says infringes academic freedom and could result in the closure of a Budapest university founded by Soros. Since coming to power in 2010, Orban has eliminated checks on his power by taking control of much of Hungary s media, curbing the powers of the constitutional court and placing loyalists in top positions at public institutions. While Brussels can open cases against EU states violating common rules, they are lengthy and often have little impact. That means the EU executive has little leverage over Orban, who has been in office since 2010 and faces an election next year. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawyers for Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, have told Trump\u2019s legal team they can no longer discuss a probe into Russian meddling in the U.S. election, indicating Flynn may be cooperating with the investigation, the New York Times reported on Thursday. Flynn, a retired Army general, is a central figure in a federal investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether Trump aides colluded with Russia to boost his 2016 presidential campaign. The probe has hung over the White House since January, when U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the election to try to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit her. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion. Flynn\u2019s lawyer and a spokesman for Mueller declined to comment on Thursday. Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Trump, said: \u201cNo one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about General Flynn cooperating against the president.\u201d The Times reported that Flynn\u2019s lawyers had been sharing information with Trump\u2019s legal team about the Mueller investigation. Citing four unnamed people involved in the case, the newspaper reported the cooperation agreement had ended. Due to rules that aim to prevent conflicts of interest when lawyers represent clients, the move by Flynn\u2019s lawyers to stop communicating with Trump\u2019s lawyers indicated Flynn was now cooperating with Mueller, the Times said, although adding that in itself was not proof. But the development has led Trump\u2019s lawyers to believe that Flynn has begun discussions with Mueller about cooperating, according to the Times. Flynn served 24 days as Trump\u2019s national security adviser but was fired after it was discovered he had misrepresented his contacts with a Russian diplomat to Vice President Mike Pence. Mueller\u2019s inquiry is looking into Flynn\u2019s paid work as a lobbyist for a Turkish businessman in 2016, in addition to contacts between Russian officials and Flynn and other Trump associates during and after the Nov. 8 presidential election, Reuters reported in June. A lawyer for Flynn\u2019s son, Michael Flynn Jr., who worked with his father and is also being investigated by Mueller, according to a person familiar with the matter, declined to comment. ",

Moscow city government auctioned off the plot, which lies on the bank s of the Moskva river and includes a number of historic buildings, and it was won by a construction company called Gorkapstroy-Garant, according to the city. The two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said that the firm represents the interests of businessman Gennady Timchenko. Reuters was not able to independently verify that Timchenko, who has been described by the U.S. Treasury Department as a member of Putin s inner circle, has a financial interest.  A spokesman for the Volga Group, which groups together Timchenko s business interests, did not respond to telephone calls or to an emailed request for comment on Thursday. The plot is a few hundred meters from the Kremlin, and some of the buildings on it date back to the 18th century. Under a development plan presented by the Moscow city government in August, the winning bidder will preserve and restore historic buildings, turn one of the buildings into a hotel and convert some of the complex into apartments.           Timchenko has since 2014 been subject to U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow for its role in the Ukraine crisis.  No contact details are listed for Gorkapstroy-Garant.

        "text": "(Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration on Tuesday: Trump will seek to convince Americans of his ability to run the country and negotiate with Congress on Tuesday in a nationally televised speech that offers a chance to move past his tumultuous first weeks in office. The White House and Congress lack agreement on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare amid signs of growing Republican division on the issue, as Trump prepares to address lawmakers about his 2017 agenda. Trump is considering introducing legislation to provide illegal immigrants a pathway to legal status - but not immediately to citizenship, CNN reported. Trump says \u201cmaybe it\u2019s my fault\u201d that his immigration policy was not communicated effectively, but gives himself a grade of A for \u201cwhat I\u2019ve actually done.\u201d Trump\u2019s nominee to be director of national intelligence pledges to back a thorough investigation of any Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election, seeking to reassure lawmakers worried that partisan politics might interfere with a probe. The National Security Agency risks a brain-drain of hackers and cyber spies because of a tumultuous reorganization and worries about the acrimonious relationship between the intelligence community and Trump, according to current and former NSA officials and cyber security industry sources. The White House denies that Trump plans to issue an executive order to change the national biofuels program, after the U.S. Renewable Fuels Association said the president\u2019s team had informed the group an order was pending. Trump\u2019s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, says the federal government should stop suing local police departments, signaling a sharp departure from the Obama administration\u2019s policy toward law enforcement exhibiting patterns of racism or excessive force. Trump\u2019s proposal to slash funding for the State Department and foreign aid faces stiff opposition in Congress, not just from Democrats, but also from many fellow Republicans. Major U.S. corporations are going to war in Washington over a Republican \u201cborder adjustment\u201d tax proposal meant to boost exports over imports, with lawmakers coming under pressure from some of the nation\u2019s biggest employers. Trump signs an order directing regulators to review an Obama administration rule that expanded the number of federally protected waterways as he targets environmental regulations conservatives label as government overreach.

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump lost his social media dominance for the first time during the Republican presidential debates as the candidates made their eighth showing Saturday night in New Hampshire. Instead, many on Twitter took to mocking contender Senator Marco Rubio, who came under heavy attack on Saturday from rivals. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie also saw a big bump in his share of the social conversation. By the end of the night, Trump, who has the most followers, still received the largest share of mentions on Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), with 33 percent compared to Rubio\u2019s 20 percent. Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, came in third, with 15 percent.  But Twitter said an hour into the debate that Rubio was the most tweeted about candidate on the social media platform, marking the first time a candidate other than Trump came out on top within that time frame.  Overall, Rubio received 10 more mentions per minute on Twitter than he did during the last Republican debate on Jan. 28, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph. Three days before New Hampshire\u2019s primary for the Nov. 8 election, many of the mentions were negative as Rubio became a target for continuing to repeat many of the same lines from his campaign stump speech. \u201cMarco, the thing is this,\u201d said rival Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, \u201cwhen you\u2019re president of the United States, when you\u2019re a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn\u2019t solve one problem for one person.\u201d That moment was measured by Twitter as one of the top social moments of the night. Actress Mia Farrow, @MiaFarrow, tweeted, \u201cRubio keeps saying the same thing.\u201d A Marco Rubio Glitch (@RubioGlitch) account also emerged, gaining nearly 1,200 followers as of Saturday night as it parodied Rubio as a robot in tweets in Spanish and English. Rubio also had his worst performance yet with millennials on the popular messaging app Yik Yak, where he had a 44 percent disapproval rating. In contrast, Ohio Governor John Kasich had his best performance with millennials, earning a 41.4 approval rating, and maintaining the largest share of the conversation on Yik Yak. The debate was also a big night on social media for Christie, who has rarely been a top contender in social mentions. According to Brandwatch, a social media analytics firm, he had the second highest percentage of positive social mentions, 61.5 percent, compared to Trump\u2019s 62.5 percent. Tyler Freeman (@tyfreem) tweeted, \u201c#GOPDebate Chris Christie has been most underrated candidate the whole campaign. He finally stood out tonight.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed its version of a massive annual defense bill on Friday, leaving out controversial amendments on transgender troops and climate policy but backing President Donald Trump\u2019s desire for a bigger, stronger military. The vote was 344-81 to pass the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which sets military policy and authorizes up to $696 billion in spending for the Department of Defense. Underscoring bipartisan support for higher defense spending in Congress, 117 Democrats joined 227 Republicans in backing the measure. Only eight Republicans and 73 Democrats voted no. But the measure faces more hurdles before it can become law, notably because it would increase military spending beyond last year\u2019s $619 billion bill, defying \u201csequestration\u201d caps on government spending set in the 2011 Budget Control Act. Trump wants to pay for a military spending increase by slashing nondefense spending. His fellow Republicans control majorities in both the House and Senate, but they will need support from Senate Democrats, who want to increase military spending, for Trump\u2019s plans to go into effect. The House NDAA also increases spending on missile defense by 25 percent, adds thousands more active-duty troops to the Army, provides five new ships for the Navy and provides a 2.4 percent salary increase for U.S. troops, their largest pay raise in eight years. And it creates a new Space Corps military service, pushed by lawmakers worried about China and Russia\u2019s activities in space, but opposed by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. The Senate will vote on its version of the NDAA later this year, and the two versions must be reconciled before the measure can be sent to the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto. Trump has not threatened to veto the bill, but his administration listed several problems with it, including opposition to the proposed Space Corps and its failure to authorize new base realignments and closures. During debate on amendments to the NDAA this week, the House rejected a Republican-sponsored amendment that would have ended the Pentagon\u2019s policy of providing gender-reassignment surgery and other therapy for active-duty transgender service members. Lawmakers also defeated a proposed Republican amendment that would have prevented the Pentagon from implementing climate-change and green energy policies. ",

        "text": "GAZA (Reuters) - The Egypt-Gaza border opened under control of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority for the first time since 2007 on Saturday, raising residents  hopes for easier passage in and out of the impoverished enclave. An Egyptian-brokered reconciliation deal last month formally restored Palestinian President Abbas s administrative control of Gaza, including its border crossings with Israel and Egypt, after a 10-year schism with Islamist Hamas. Palestinians hope the pact will ease Gaza s economic woes and help them present a united front in their drive for statehood, although the details of implementation of the deal have yet to be worked out fully. Citing security concerns, Egypt and Israel maintain tight restrictions at their Gaza borders. Hamas, regarded by the West as a terrorist group, seized the enclave in 2007 after fighting forces loyal to Abbas. Hamas quit positions at three Gaza crossings and handed them over to Palestinian Authority employees on Nov. 1, in a step seen as vital to encouraging Israel and Egypt to ease their restrictions on the movement of goods and people. Witnesses said at least five buses loaded with passengers crossed over to the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing on Saturday. Hamas-appointed policemen had checked travellers  documents in a separate hall outside Rafah.  Egypt has not yet signaled any change to its present policy under which it opens the border crossing three times a week. Palestinians are hoping the crossing will operate full-time, as it had been doing until 2007. About 30,000 Gazans have applied for entry to Egypt in the past few months, according to the Palestinian Interior Ministry. Egypt will host further talks with Hamas, Fatah and other factions next week on Nov. 21 to discuss major reconciliation issues, including security arrangements and a possible date for Palestinian presidential and parliamentary elections. Responsibility for security remains an open issue in Gaza, where Hamas, which still polices the territory, has what analysts say are at least 25,000 well-equipped fighters. The group refuses to disarm, as demanded by Israel and the United States. ",

        "title": "Trump tells Republicans to get back on healthcare bill",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and members of his administration on Sunday goaded Republican senators to stick with trying to pass a healthcare bill, after the lawmakers failed spectacularly last week to muster the votes to end Obamacare. For the second day running, the Republican president tweeted his impatience with Congress\u2019 inability to deliver on his party\u2019s seven-year promise to replace the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare bill commonly known as Obamacare. Members of his administration took to the airwaves to try to compel lawmakers to take action. But it was unclear whether the White House admonishments would have any impact on Capitol Hill, where Republicans who control both houses signaled last week that it was time to move on to other issues. Republicans\u2019 zeal to repeal and replace Obamacare was met with both intra-party divisions between moderates and conservatives and also the increasing approval of a law that raised the number of insured Americans by 20 million.   Polling indicates a majority of Americans are ready to move on from healthcare at this point. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Saturday, 64 percent of 1,136 people surveyed on Friday and Saturday said they wanted to keep Obamacare, either \u201centirely as is\u201d or after fixing \u201cproblem areas.\u201d That is up from 54 percent in January.   With the U.S. legislative branch spinning its wheels, the executive branch pledged to look at rewriting Obamacare regulations. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that he would change those regulations that drive up costs or \u201churt\u201d patients. Price sidestepped questions about whether there were administration plans to waive Obamacare\u2019s mandate that individuals have health insurance, saying \u201call things are on the table to try to help patients.\u201d But Price also told NBC he would implement Obamacare because it is the \u201claw of the land.\u201d That Obamacare was still law clearly angered Trump, who has no major legislative accomplishments to show for his first half-year in office. \u201cDon\u2019t give up Republican Senators, the World is watching: Repeal & Replace ...\u201d the president said in a tweet on Sunday morning. On Friday, Senate Republicans failed to collect enough votes to repeal even a few parts of Obamacare. That capped a week of failed Senate votes on whether to simply repeal, or repeal and replace, the 2010 law, while Trump repeatedly berated lawmakers in a late attempt to influence the legislation.  \u201cThe president will not accept those who said, quote, \u2018it\u2019s time to move on,\u2019\u201d Kellyanne Conway, a senior counselor to Trump, said on Fox News Sunday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, had made exactly that comment before dawn on Friday morning after the failed healthcare vote.      The White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said on Sunday lawmakers should stay in session to get something done on healthcare - even if this means postponing votes on other issues such as raising the debt ceiling. \u201cSo yes. They need to stay. They need to work. They need to pass something,\u201d Mulvaney said on CNN. The House of Representatives has already gone home for its August break and the Senate is expected to do the same by mid-August. Mulvaney also said Trump was seriously considering carrying out threats he tweeted about on Saturday, when the president said that \u201cif a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!\u201d  That tweet appeared to be referring to the approximately $8 billion in cost-sharing reduction subsidies the federal government pays to insurers to lower the price of health coverage for low-income Americans.  The Saturday tweet also appeared to be a threat to end the  employer contribution for members of Congress and their staffs, who were moved from the normal federal employee healthcare benefits program onto the Obamacare insurance exchanges as part of the 2010 healthcare law. \u201cWhat he\u2019s saying is, look, if Obamacare is hurting the American people \u2013 and it is \u2013 then why shouldn\u2019t it hurt insurance companies and more importantly, perhaps for this discussion, members of Congress?\u201d Mulvaney said on Sunday on CNN. Some Republicans have said they are trying to find a way forward on healthcare. Senate Republican Susan Collins, one of three Republicans who voted against repealing parts of Obamacare on Friday, told NBC that Congress should produce a series of bills with bipartisan input on healthcare, including appropriating the cost-sharing subsidies.  The Senate has one vote scheduled when it reconvenes on Monday afternoon: whether to confirm a U.S. circuit court judge. Senate aides said they had no guidance for the agenda beyond that vote.  ",

Sheikh Ahmad al-Assir, who refused to recognize the hearing, was convicted for his part in clashes that erupted amid heightened sectarian tensions in 2013, exacerbated by the war in neighboring Syria. Assir rose to prominence supporting the mostly Sunni insurgents in Syria and condemning the backers of the Syrian government, including Lebanon s Shi ite Muslim Hezbollah group. Lebanese soldiers raided a mosque complex belonging to Assir in June 2013, after skirmishes between his supporters and opponents in the southern Mediterranean port city of Sidon. The army said at least 18 soldiers died in fighting with Assir's supporters, which raised fears at the time of sectarian violence spreading in Lebanon. (reut.rs/2xBmdx6) Assir went into hiding and was arrested two years later at Beirut airport, trying to get out with a false passport. He rejected his court-appointed lawyer during the trial, which has been delayed several times. Dozens of his supporters protested outside the court in Beirut and in Sidon on Thursday. The court also convicted more than 30 others, some in absentia, for their part in the violence, imposing sentences ranging from six months in prison to death. Lebanese singer-turned-militant Fadel Shaker was sentenced in absentia to 15 years. Lebanon has not carried out an execution for at least 10 years. ",

The statement was issued after delegations led by Cuba\u2019s Foreign Ministry chief for U.S. Affairs Josefina Vidal and U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs John Creamer met to discuss migration issues. Many Cubans said they were heartbroken because they could not visit, or be with, their loved ones. While Cuba has a population of 11.2 million people, there are an estimated 2 million Cuban Americans in the United States.    The Trump administration also issued a warning on travel to Cuba and in October expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from Washington.  The Cuban foreign ministry said this had \u201cseriously affected the functioning of the diplomatic mission, particularly the Consulate and the services it offers to Cubans residing in the United States\u201d. The U.S. decision to cancel the visits of official  delegations to Cuba was also having a \u201ccounterproductive effect\u201d on cooperation in fields like migration, the ministry said. On the positive side, both the U.S. and Cuban delegations commented on the drop in illegal Cuban migration to the United States during the talks as a result of past moves towards normalizing relations. Obama, who announced the detente with Cuba nearly three years ago, eliminated a policy granting automatic residency to virtually all Cubans who arrived on U.S. turf in January, just before leaving office. Cuba had asked for the change for years, saying that policy encouraged dangerous journeys and people trafficking. \u201cApprehensions of Cuban migrants at U.S. ports of entry decreased by 64 percent from fiscal year 2016 to 2017, and maritime interdictions of Cuban migrants decreased by 71 percent,\u201d the U.S. State Department said in a statement. Trump said in June he was canceling Obama\u2019s \u201cterrible and misguided deal\u201d with Havana, returning to Cold War rhetoric, and his administration has tightened trade and travel restrictions. He has however in practise left in place many of Obama\u2019s changes including restored diplomatic relations and resumed direct U.S.-Cuba commercial flights and cruise-ship travel. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In an awkward reversal, the U.S. military promptly withdrew an old video by Islamist militants it had released on Friday as evidence that a fatal raid in Yemen by American special forces this week was a counter terrorism success.  An expert in radical Islamist media said the footage by unknown militants appeared to be part of videos first released by jihadists online some 10 years ago, undermining the Pentagon\u2019s explanation about its value.  A U.S. Central Command spokesman confirmed that the video was removed from the website because the contents were old.    \u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to appear that we were trying to pass off an old video as a new video,\u201d spokesman Colonel John Thomas said. It is the latest controversy surrounding the raid on a branch of al Qaeda in Yemen, the first such operation authorized by President Donald Trump as commander in chief. The military said the video was found on Sunday in the operation in al-Bayda province in which a U.S. Navy SEAL, militants and civilians were killed.      A U.S. Central Command spokesman had said on Friday the clip of a ski-masked man encouraging people to build bombs, was \u201cone example of the volumes of sensitive al-Qa\u2019eda terror-planning information recovered during the operation.\u201d  The Department of Defense posted the video on its web site on Friday but pulled it off within several hours when questions began to arise about its age.     The footage appeared to be similar to that in other videos that surfaced online in 2007.  \u201cThe video clip that was posted and abruptly taken down was one of 25 videos that appeared (published) in 2007,\u201d said Adam Raisman, a senior analyst at SITE group which monitors extremists online. He added that the only difference was that the Pentagon video had English subtitles added.        Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said the video was still of worth, even if it may have been created earlier.  \u201cIt does not matter when the video was made, that they had it is still illustrative of who they are and what their intentions are,\u201d Davis said.      U.S. Navy SEAL William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens was killed in the raid, which the Pentagon said also killed 14 militants. Medics at the scene said about 30 people, including 10 women and children, also died. U.S. military officials told Reuters this week that the operation went ahead without sufficient intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations.  As a result, three officials said, the attacking SEAL team found itself dropping onto a reinforced al Qaeda base defended by landmines, snipers, and a larger than expected contingent of heavily armed Islamist extremists.         But Central Command said earlier this week that it only asks for operations it believes have a good chance of success based on its planning. Pentagon spokesman Davis has said the element of surprise had not been lost in the raid.     ",

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage is a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in the U.S. investigation into possible collusion between Russia and Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, the Guardian reported on Thursday citing unidentified sources. The London-based newspaper said Farage had not been accused of wrongdoing and was not a suspect or target of the U.S. investigation. But it said he was \u201cright in the middle\u201d of the relationships being looked at.  The newspaper said the former leader of the UK Independence Party had \u201craised the interest\u201d of FBI investigators due to his connections with Trump and Julian Assange\u2019s Wikileaks, which published leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee during the campaign. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment on the Guardian story, and other U.S. officials said they were unaware of any serious FBI interest in Farage.  Farage said on Twitter it had taken him a long time to read the Guardian article because he was \u201claughing so much at this fake news\u201d. \u201cThis hysterical attempt to associate me with the (Vladimir) Putin regime is a result of the liberal elite being unable to accept Brexit and Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI consider it extremely doubtful that I could be a person of interest to the FBI as I have no connections to Russia.\u201d Accusations that Russia interfered in the U.S. 2016 presidential election have dogged Trump since he entered office and a former FBI chief, Robert Mueller, has been named as special counsel to investigate any collusion. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia used computer hacking, propaganda and misleading news reports designed to sway political opinion in an attempt to boost Trump\u2019s chances of winning the White House. Trump has dismissed the notion that Russia played any role in his November election victory. Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin, a former KGB spy, has denied meddling in the U.S. election.  CIA Director Mike Pompeo called Assange\u2019s Wikileaks a \u201chostile intelligence service\u201d in April after it distributed material hacked from Democratic National Committee computers during the 2016 campaign.  Pompeo said Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence service had used Wikileaks to distribute the material and concluded that Russia stole the emails and took other actions to tilt the election in favor of Trump, a Republican, over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. \u201cOne of the things the intelligence investigators have been looking at is points of contact and persons involved,\u201d the Guardian quoted one source as saying. \u201cIf you triangulate Russia, WikiLeaks, Assange and Trump associates the person who comes up with the most hits is Nigel Farage.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s right in the middle of these relationships. He turns up over and over again. There\u2019s a lot of attention being paid to him.\u201d Farage, who campaigned for decades for Britain to leave the European Union, was a vocal backer of Trump, appearing on the campaign trail and meeting him in New York just days after the election victory.  Farage, who also attended Trump\u2019s inauguration in Washington, met Assange in March this year at the Ecuadorean embassy in London where the Wikileaks founder has been holed up for five years. ",

        "text": "ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The Red Cross has halted operations across a third of South Sudan after gunmen shot dead a staff member, in what the U.N. said on Wednesday was the biggest such suspension during the country s four-year civil war. Kennedy Laki Emmanuel, a driver for the Red Cross, died on Sept. 8 when gunmen fired on a 10-vehicle convoy delivering aid in South Sudan s restive Western Equatoria state. In response, the International Committee of the Red Cross shut down activities across Equatoria, a region roughly the size of Britain that borders Congo and Uganda and has seen some of the heaviest fighting over the last year. The suspension affected more than 22,000 people about to get aid deliveries from the Red Cross. That included more than 5,000 farmers due to receive seeds in an area teetering on the edge of famine.       The ICRC will not resume anything until we have a clear picture of exactly what happened and until we receive the necessary security guarantees,  spokeswoman Mari Mortvedt told Reuters. The security of the ICRC staff is top priority.  The U.N. s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  told Reuters that no aid group had shut down its operations over such a large area since South Sudan s civil war began in 2013.  The conflict began after President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, fired his deputy Riek Machar, an ethnic Nuer. The U.N. says ethnic cleansing has taken place and warned of genocide, amid reports of murder, rape, and torture of civilians. More than two million South Sudanese have now fled the country, creating Africa s biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and more than half of those remaining need food aid. The country s original population was 12 million.  At least 85 aid workers have been killed, according to the U.N., including 18 this year, making it the deadliest country for aid workers in the world. That number did not include a staff member for aid group World Vision, killed in the Western Equatoria town of Yambio on September 3. It was not clear whether that death was related to his work as an aid worker, so it was not included in the total, the group said.

        "title": "Low turnout in Chile election could hand victory to Pinera",
        "text": "SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The frontrunner for Chile s presidency, billionaire businessman Sebastian Pinera, faces an array of left-wing parties in this year s elections but he can expect help from one quarter - low turnout. Recent opinion polls give Pinera, a conservative former president, a commanding lead over his seven mostly left-of-center rivals for the Nov. 19 first round but predict he is unlikely to take the more than 50 percent needed to avoid a run-off. While a unified left might muster the votes to defeat Pinera in the second round, weak turnout fed by disenchantment with politics and interparty bickering would pave the way for a Pinera win.  It s likely that many left-wing voters are not going to vote in the second round because their candidate will have been eliminated, and with this drop, Pinera s vote share catapults,  said analyst Kenneth Bunker, of Tresquintos.   Pinera is going to win if fewer people vote.  Investors strongly favor Pinera and bet he would better manage labor and education reforms implemented by current center-left President Michelle Bachelet, in power since 2014. Chile, South America s most developed economy, is one of the few countries in the region that does not have mandatory voting.  Turnout in the elections following Chile s transition from compulsory to voluntary voting in 2012 has dipped as low as 42 percent, near the bottom of developed countries, according to statistics from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. Many Chileans are disenchanted with politics following campaign finance scandals that have tainted parties of both the right and left. Unlike citizens of Brazil, Peru and Argentina, they have the right to abstain without repercussions. A recent CEP poll, conducted in September and October, found that only 43 percent of Chileans are likely to vote in the coming election. The poll showed Pinera would beat his two closest contenders, the center-left Alejandro Guillier and leftist Beatriz Sanchez, in a Dec. 17 runoff. Coalitions of Chile s center-left parties for decades dominated politics but have fractured in the face of disagreements over Bachelet s economic and social reforms. The CEP poll found that only 11 percent of voters sympathize with Bachelet s Nueva Mayoria coalition and nearly 60 percent of Chileans did not identify with any of the major political parties.  Pinera s campaign has sought to capitalize on growing discontent and division among the left by appealing to centrist Christian Democratic voters, historically the largest bloc within Bachelet s coalition. Pinera recently called former President Patricio Aylwin, a Christian Democrat credited with smoothing Chile s transition to democracy in the 1990s, an  example to follow.  Candidates on the left have sought to counteract Pinera s advances by attempting to rally new voters.  We need a program that makes sense for everyone. If voter participation increases, we win,  said center-left frontrunner Guillier, a former journalist and legislator. In late October, Bachelet s administration launched a get-out-the-vote campaign of television and radio advertisements, calling the election  an important moment for our democracy.  Pinera has criticized the campaign as a political maneuver, but Maria Luisa Puig, of the Eurasia Group, said that motivating a large remaining block of undecided, or uninspired, voters in the center of the political spectrum could prove critical to both sides.  Voter turnout will be the key to this election,  she said. ",

A truck bombing in Mogadishu last weekend killed at least 358 people, with 56 people still missing. Almost all of the dead were civilians and the attack triggered angry demonstrations in the capital.  Sunday s bombing hit a minibus in Daniga village about 40 km (25 miles) to the northwest of Mogadishu.   We heard a huge crash today and we went to the scene, we saw a ruined minibus and at least seven dead bodies, mostly women. We could not identify some people, they were just pieces of human flesh,  farmer Nur Abdullahi told Reuters by phone. The area of the bombing is close to areas held by al Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked insurgents who want to overthrow the weak U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law.   We are scared,  Abdullahi said  Hundreds of masked militants are everywhere and we anticipate the government will attack here. They also planted mines everywhere and today we pack our clothes to flee.  An army officer said the death toll might be higher.  We know the minibus left Afgooye (town) this morning and it was carrying farmers, mostly women,  said Captain Isa Osman of the Somali National Army.   It was carrying more than 10 people. We cannot get many details because the area is not controlled by government.  After last Saturday s attack, the government promised new offensives against the insurgency.

        "title": "Insight: Emails show how Republicans lobbied to limit voting hours in North Carolina",
        "text": " (This version of the November 3 story officially corrects paragraph 13 to read Chapel Hill, instead of Raleigh. The White House initially misidentified Obama\u2019s location in a transcript of his remarks) By Julia Harte ASHEBORO, N.C. (Reuters) - When Bill McAnulty, an elections board chairman in a mostly white North Carolina county, agreed in July to open a Sunday voting site where black church members could cast ballots after services, the reaction was swift: he was labeled a traitor by his fellow Republicans. \u201cI became a villain, quite frankly,\u201d recalled McAnulty at a state board of elections meeting in September that had been called to resolve disputes over early voting plans.\u00a0\u201cI got accused of being a traitor and everything else by the Republican Party,\u201d McAnulty said. Following the blowback from Republicans, McAnulty later withdrew his support for the Sunday site. In an interview with Reuters, he said he ultimately ruled against opening the Sunday voting site in Randolph County because he had \u201cmade a mistake in reading the wishes of the voters.\u201d He declined to discuss the episode further. This year\u2019s highly charged presidential contest between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump has stoked accusations by both parties of political meddling in the scheduling of early voting hours in North Carolina, a coveted battleground state with a history of tight elections. In emails, state and county Republican officials lobbied  members of at least 17 county election boards to keep early-voting sites open for shorter hours on weekends and in evenings \u2013 times that usually see disproportionately high turnout by Democratic voters. Reuters obtained the emails through a public records request. The officials also urged county election boards to open fewer sites for residents to cast ballots during early voting that began on Oct. 20 and ends on Saturday. Civil rights advocates and Democrats launched their own campaigns for expanded early voting hours.  The tug-of-war yielded mixed results. The state did ultimately add nearly 5,900 more hours and 78 more sites to vote early than in 2012. But several counties  opened only one polling site during the first week of early voting, slightly denting turnout across the state. Voter turnout dropped by 20 percent in the counties that had multiple polling sites during the first week of early voting in 2012 but just one site during the first week in 2016. \u201cWe currently have more early voting locations and hours open than ever were open under Democrat control,\u201d said North Carolina Republican Party executive director Dallas\u00a0Woodhouse, denying his party was trying to suppress the Democratic vote. President Barack Obama praised the expanded early voting opportunities during an election stop in North Carolina on Wednesday. \u201cThose who wanted to suppress the vote, they\u2019re going to fail,\u201d he said at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in Chapel Hill. \u201cRight now, there are more one-stop early vote sites in North Carolina than ever before.\u201d  Counties that Obama, a Democrat, won in 2012 increased their Sunday hours this year by 16 percent, while counties that voted for his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, decreased them by nearly a quarter, the records show. State Republican officials say keeping polls open during evenings and weekends, or \u201coff-hour\u201d times, drains county resources. In two emails, on Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, Woodhouse urged Republicans serving on county election boards to follow the \u201cparty line\u201d on curtailing the early voting period.  \u201cMany of our folks are angry and opposed to Sunday voting,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSix days of voting in one week is enough. Period.\u201d Keeping polling sites open for the full 17-day early voting period \u201cmay be wasteful and unnecessary,\u201d he added.  Woodhouse\u2019s emails were subsequently published by local media, but he was not alone in lobbying to limit voting hours, the Reuters review of public records shows. The review counted similar emails from at least four other Republican Party officials to election boards, each of which is composed of two Republicans and one Democrat. The same day that Woodhouse sent his Aug. 11 email, Elaine Hewitt, a member of the Rowan County Republican Executive Committee, sent the county elections board two proposed schedules for early voting, both of which included just one site for the first four days and no sites on Sundays.  \u201cWith all of the opportunities to vote by mail, early in person Monday - Saturday, and on Election Day, there is no justification for requiring election workers to work on Sundays,\u201d she wrote.  Garry Terry, the chairman of the Republican Party for North Carolina\u2019s First Congressional District, sent an email on Aug. 13 to elections board members in his region, reminding them to act \u201cin the best interest of the Republican Party\u201d by opposing Sunday voting and restricting early voting to one location. Hewitt and Terry did not respond to requests for comment. Woodhouse defended the actions of the Republican officials, telling Reuters that Republican opposition to Sunday voting was not discriminatory but was rather based on the belief that people should not be required to work on Sundays. The Sunday polling site that McAnulty first supported and then opposed would have been located at the Randolph County Board of Elections office and would have cost around $1,000 to operate, according to the office director. \u201cIf it\u2019s not wasteful and it allows more people to vote... the board has historically been for that,\u201d Margaret Megerian, the Democratic member of board, told Reuters. In contrast with the Republicans\u2019 email campaign, the Democratic push to expand early voting hours has largely taken shape in public forums. In Democratic-leaning Guilford County, the state\u2019s third largest, a county board of elections meeting on Aug. 8 attracted about 75 people after word spread that the board was planning to halve the number of early voting sites, from 24 in 2012. The Rev. Nelson Johnson said in an interview that the proposal by the board\u2019s Republican chairwoman would \u201cprevent voting especially by people who can\u2019t easily take time off\u201d and said it \u201cabsolutely\u201d had a racial intent. Johnson, who is African American, leads a community center in Greensboro, North Carolina. Board Chairwoman Kathryn Lindley told Reuters she believed \u201ca lesser number of sites would cause less confusion about which places were going to be open,\u201d and that it was \u201cludicrous\u201d to think her suggested plan had been discriminatory. The board ultimately agreed to 25 early voting sites and one day of Sunday voting before the November election. Johnson said the decision was \u201ca significant triumph.\u201d Lindley said Johnson\u2019s group had no influence on the final outcome. Guilford\u2019s plan also included one restriction that particularly angered Democrats. In the first week of early voting in 2012, residents could vote at 16 sites. This year, that has been reduced to one.  Mary Cranford, 52, a registered Republican, was fourth in line on the first day of early voting in Guilford. She was able to vote but said she was upset that only one site was open for the first week. She said she voted for Clinton this year.\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t believe what\u2019s been done to keep some people from voting in this state,\u201d she said. Just 7,916 people voted in the first week of early voting in Guilford this year, compared to 60,732 in 2012, according to state elections board records. The general counsel for Clinton\u2019s campaign and other plaintiffs filed a court motion on Oct. 1 demanding Guilford and four other North Carolina counties expand their early voting opportunities. The court denied it, saying that changing the early voting plans \u201cwould create logistical difficulties.\u201d ",

Oh students,  he says.  I won t be here but you will still have the trees to give you fruit and shade and take care of you every year. So you will remember me and not be so sad.  The author of  The Gardener  was Wa Lone, one of two Reuters journalists who were arrested in Yangon last week and accused of violating the country s colonial-era Official Secrets Act. Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, had worked on Reuters coverage of a crisis that has seen some 650,000 Rohingya Muslims flee from a fierce military crackdown on militants in the western state of Rakhine. They have not been seen for a week.   The Gardener  is one of a series published by The Third Story Project, a venture co-founded by Wa Lone that produces books in Burmese, other Myanmar languages and English and distributes them free to children across the country. On the project s website, Wa Lone says the aim was to promote tolerance and harmony in an increasingly multicultural and diverse world.  Lack of understanding has led to conflicts between different communities and finally destroyed peace and stability,  he wrote.  I love every Third Story book because they address important issues for future generations.  In Wa Lone s story, which also carries a message of the importance of protecting the environment, the teacher scatters seeds from his bicycle on the journey to school and years later they have grown into huge trees. He also plants a garden with his students and, there, he tells them stories. He leaves them one day to help another village, where all the trees had been cut down and there was no fruit, water or shelter for the people and animals.

The letter followed a call for a federal probe by Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, immediately after the election, calling the vote \u201ca fiasco\u201d as he cited \u201cunacceptably disparate distribution of polling locations.\u201d In what officials called a cost-cutting move, Maricopa County slashed its polling sites to 60, down from 200 in 2012. Voters last month waited in line for up to five hours to cast ballots and well into the night at the sharply reduced number of polls.  In its letter, the Justice Department cites reports of \u201ca disproportional burden in waiting times ... in some areas with substantial racial or language minority populations.\u201d The Justice Department set an April 22 deadline for a response. Following the election, officials said their decisions on polling places were based on recent voting patterns and an increasing number of mail-in ballots. Karen Osborne, county elections director, denied there was any intent to rob voters of their rights and said officials would comply with the Justice Department request. \u201cThis is a request for information,\u201d Osborne said in a brief interview on Monday with Reuters. \u201cWe are going to gather the information, and we will get it together by the 22nd, and we will make it public.\u201d The state formally certified the election on Monday and candidates have five days to contest the results. In the Republican contest, Donald Trump won, while in the Democratic contest, Hillary Clinton won. An attorney for Democrat Bernie Sanders has said his campaign is considering a challenge. ",

        "title": "Michigan governor names panel to fix Flint's contaminated water system",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder on Wednesday appointed a group of government officials, health and other experts to implement long-term fixes for Flint\u2019s lead-contaminated water system, which has become a national scandal. The 17-member committee would recommend ways to help people exposed to lead, study Flint\u2019s water infrastructure and determine possible upgrades. The members includes Flint Mayor Karen Weaver and county and state officials. Snyder, a Republican, also said he wanted the Medicaid social health care program to be expanded to cover all Flint children. In an interview airing on CNN Wednesday evening, Snyder said that officials expect a higher tally of children affected than blood tests have shown so far. \u201cThere could be many more,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re assuming that.\u201d Democrats in the U.S. Senate were preparing to unveil legislation as early as Thursday aimed at aiding Flint, but would not provide details. It could be debated on the Senate floor next week as part of an unrelated energy bill, aides said. Activists in Flint plan to present petitions with almost 20,000 signatures to Weaver and Snyder on Thursday calling for a moratorium on water bills. Snyder\u2019s team includes two people who helped focus attention on the water crisis - Flint pediatrician Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha and Marc Edwards, a civil engineering professor at Virginia Tech who would oversee all state and federal water testing. Snyder is asking for $3 million in state funds for water bills. \u201cFlint residents should not have to pay for water they did not and are not using,\u201d Weaver said. Also on Wednesday, a coalition of Flint residents and national groups filed a lawsuit asking a Detroit federal court to compel city and state officials to replace all lead water pipes promptly and at no cost to residents. The National Resources Defense Council, the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan and Flint residents asked for relief for any medical harm suffered. Lead is a neurotoxin that can damage the brain and cause other health problems. Snyder has repeatedly apologized for the delay in addressing Flint\u2019s problems, which have led some critics to call for his censure or arrest. Residents of the city of 100,000 people had complained for months about elevated readings of lead in drinking water and the blood of some children. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette named a special prosecutor to look into possible crimes in the crisis. ",

        "title": "Russia becomes Iraq Kurds' top funder, quiet about independence vote",
        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Russia, the only major power that has not called on Iraq s Kurds to cancel a referendum on independence next week, has swiftly become the top funder of Kurdish oil and gas deals, with as much as $4 billion pledged in less than a year, industry sources say. Washington, European countries, Turkey and Iran have all lined up to oppose a move by Iraq s Kurds to hold a Sept. 25 independence referendum, which the Kurds consider the culmination of decades of struggle for a state of their own, but Iraq calls a violation of its constitution. This week, the White House issued a statement calling the planned vote  provocative and destabilizing , noting that it will take place not only within the autonomous Kurdish region itself but on territory that is disputed. But Moscow has issued no such call to cancel the vote. Instead, with the planned referendum just days away, Russian state oil giant Rosneft announced its latest investment last week, to help Iraqi Kurdistan develop its natural gas industry, for domestic supplies and eventual export. The full value of the deal has not been disclosed officially, but according to industry sources familiar with it, it is worth more than $1 billion.  It is Rosneft s third giant venture in the Kurdish region since February, transforming Moscow from an outsider with little profile in Kurdistan into the region s biggest source of cash. According to the industry sources, Rosneft s deals since it first arrived in Kurdistan last December are worth around $4 billion in total. That exceeds the $2 billion in financing the Kurdish region has previously received for oil sales from international trading firms that pre-pay for its exports, and  $1.5 billion it has received from neighbor Turkey. It also marks a big change in focus for the Iraqi Kurds, who have had close ties with Washington since 1991 when the United States offered them protection from Saddam Hussein, the dictator later toppled by U.S. forces in 2003.  Moscow has been effectively filling the gap as the United States has been pulling back from Iraq,  said a senior source in Erbil, capital of the Iraqi Kurdish region. Publicly, Moscow says it supports Iraq s territorial integrity while also recognizing the aspirations of the Kurds for a homeland. The 35 million Kurds are spread over Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria.  We are interested that the Kurdish people like any other nation on the planet can fulfill its hopes and aspirations,  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in July.  We start from the fact that the legitimate aspirations of the Kurds, like other peoples, need to be fulfilled within the framework of existing international legal norms.  But unlike other powers, Moscow has avoided giving a verdict on the legality or wisdom of holding the referendum itself. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow said it had nothing to add to Lavrov s comments on the matter from July.  The Russian position is:  Let s wait and see the outcome of the referendum,  said Hoshiyar Zebari, one of Iraq s pre-eminent Kurdish politicians, who served as foreign minister, deputy prime minister and finance minister in Baghdad from 2003 until last year and now advises Kurdistan s regional government.  They seem to understand our situation,  Zebari told Reuters, adding that Moscow expected the Kurds would use the outcome of the referendum as part of a process of negotiation with Baghdad. According to a diplomatic source, the Kurds took notice in June when Lavrov signaled to a Kurdish delegation at a meeting in St Petersburg that Russia would not oppose the referendum.  During previous meetings, Lavrov always focused on Iraq s territorial integrity,  said the source, who was present at the meeting on the sidelines of Russia s economic forum in St Petersburg.   This time, he said that Russia understands the ambitions of Kurdish people for independence. And even though he added that it needed to be done carefully, it was a big signal.  At around the same time as that meeting took place, Rosneft was signing its second of this year s three major oil investment deals with Kurdish officials. Days later, the Kurds announced the date of their referendum. The Russians are not the first foreigners to come to Kurdistan looking for oil. The Kurds have long argued that as an autonomous region of Iraq they have the authority to make agreements with foreign companies about pumping the oil on their territory. Iraq s central government, meanwhile, says any deals to export oil from Kurdistan are illegal without Baghdad s blessing. For several years, American companies were at the forefront of negotiating deals with the Kurds, on the assumption that Baghdad would eventually authorize them. The highest-profile deal was announced by Exxon Mobil, then under the leadership of CEO Rex Tillerson, now U.S. Secretary of State. But after signing a landmark deal to develop Kurdish oil fields in 2011, Exxon did little exploration, and has since handed some of the blocs back to the Kurdish government. While Washington remains friendly with the Kurds and sees them as a bulwark against Islamic State, it is concerned about their independence bid leading to the breakup of Iraq or a rupture with Turkey. The United States has long encouraged the Kurds to avoid unilateral steps, such as the referendum, that might destabilize the Baghdad government or antagonize Ankara. Russia, meanwhile, is looking for more friends in the Middle East after returning in force to the region with a decisive military intervention in Syria. Its main regional allies are Iran and the Syria of President Bashar al-Assad, and having friends in Kurdish territory, located between Syria, Iran and Turkey, would be geopolitically useful. Kurdistan has estimated recoverable reserves at 45 billion barrels of oil and 5.66 trillion cubic meters of gas, which could rise further with exploration. For Rosneft, run by Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, it potentially offers a cheap source of crude supplies to refineries in Europe, and a big boost to Rosneft s gas ambitions. In 2014, Erbil started oil sales via a pipeline through Turkey. It has generally conducted those deals with pre-financing, obtaining money in advance from international trading firms and Turkey before the oil is delivered. Rosneft began its involvement with a small pre-finance deal at the end of last year along the lines of deals the Kurds had previously reached with global traders. The Russian firm loaned the Kurds around $280 million, guaranteed by future oil sales, according to industry sources. In February 2017, Rosneft ramped up its cooperation by agreeing to lend the semi-autonomous region $1.2 billion, becoming the first big foreign oil company to publicly commit to pre-financing Kurdish exports. Kurdistan s minister of natural resources Ashti Hawrami called the deal a ground-breaker for the region that would help its economic independence - a crucial condition for seeking political independence. By that point, Turkey had invested some $1.5 billion and international trading houses such as Vitol, Petraco, Trafigura and Glencore had collectively loaned the Kurds some $2 billion. Russia became the Kurds  single biggest financer with its next deal in June this year to lend money and help search for more oil, bringing its total investments close to $2.8 billion. This week s Russian pledge to invest more than $1 billion in Kurdistan s gas infrastructure could help the region become a major gas exporter to Turkey and Europe one day, Rosneft says. The independence referendum won t be a problem.  Holding the referendum will not affect our work. We are doing business in an autonomous region in Iraq that has been recognized by law,  Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontev said this week.  This place is run by Iraqi Kurdistan s nation and it is the people of Iraqi Kurdistan who live there. That is why we don t think we are embarking on an adventure.  ",

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Controversies over fake news have damaged trust in media in the United States and elsewhere, but the impact is far worse for social media and online-only outlets than it is for traditional print and TV outlets, a survey has found. The research and data company Kantar, in a survey of 8,000 people in the United States, Brazil, Britain and France, found that newspapers, magazines and TV news outlets had retained a greater measure of public trust than digital specialists had. In the United States, mainstream media have reported on the online spread of fabricated stories aimed at helping Donald Trump win the presidency last year. Meanwhile, Trump has accused the mainstream media itself of producing fake news. Overall, 58 percent of those surveyed said that as a result of becoming aware of fake news they had less trust in social media news stories about politics or elections. For mainstream media, the figure was 24 percent.  The efforts to brand  mainstream news media  as  fake news  have largely failed,  Kantar said. The survey drew a link between depth of coverage and trust levels. The findings showed that a much higher proportion of people rated magazines, TV news channels, radio and newspapers highly for in-depth commentary and analysis, than did so for social media news.  News audiences are far from dumbing down. They demand serious content and the provision of this type of content will help deepen the nature of consumer relationships with news organizations offline and online,  the survey said. Kantar said its analysis showed usage of the expression  fake news  had surged in mainstream news around the time of the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, and had peaked on Trump s first day in office in January this year. However, there was a lack of consensus and clarity on the definition and origin of fake news.  Asked what that expression meant, 58 percent of respondents said it referred to stories deliberately fabricated by a mainstream news organization. Forty-two percent said it described stories put out by someone pretending to be a news organization. Of the four countries surveyed, Brazil had the highest proportion of people who believed fake news had influenced the outcome of elections in their country, at 69 percent. In the United States, the figure was 47 percent.  The term  fake news  has been used by the U.S. president so frequently that it comes as no surprise that U.S. audiences are more aware of its impact,  the survey said.  In Brazil, however, although a national election has not been held since 2014, a series of corruption scandals have likely raised news audience sensitivity to political news.  ",

The lawsuit filed in the Southern District of Texas is a class action, meaning others can join. It requests a ruling before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Lawyers for Cruz also argue he has yet to be the Republican Party\u2019s nominee and it would be premature for a court to address the issue. \u201cNowhere does Plaintiff, who acknowledges that he is a Democrat ... explain how he is harmed by Senator Cruz\u2019s presence on the Republican primary ballot,\u201d the Cruz filing said. Billionaire Donald Trump, the front-runner in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, has repeatedly questioned whether Cruz is eligible and warned that his winning the nomination could throw the party into chaos and hand the election to the Democrats. Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta in 1970. At the time, his mother was a U.S. citizen and his father was Cuban.  He has dismissed attacks on his eligibility and noted in the filing that 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain and 1968 Republican candidate George Romney also were born outside the United States but were considered eligible to be president.  The U.S. Constitution says a president or vice president must be a \u201cnatural-born citizen\u201d but does not say whether the term means the candidate must be born on U.S. soil or just be a citizen at birth.

Nearly all major unions endorsed Trump\u2019s rival, Hillary Clinton, during the presidential election campaign.

        "text": "(Reuters) - An Alabama city appears to be the first in the country to specify criminal penalties for violators of an ordinance requiring people to use bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificates, civil rights groups said on Wednesday. The law passed on Tuesday by the city council in Oxford, located about 60 miles east of Birmingham, carries a possible punishment of a $500 fine or six months in jail. The measure raises the stakes in the U.S. bathroom wars that have caused fierce debate among state lawmakers, school officials and Republican presidential candidates. It goes further than a law enacted last month in North Carolina - which has been boycotted by businesses, entertainers and government workers - since it became the first state to bar transgender people from using bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. North Carolina\u2019s law applies to restrooms and locker rooms in government-owned facilities and schools. The Oxford ordinance also includes bathrooms in private businesses and explicitly makes violating the provision a crime, the Human Rights Campaign said. \u201cThis is a very concerning expansion of the ways in which trans people are going to be and have been policed,\u201d said Chase Strangio, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s LGBT Project. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially just criminalizing trans existence.\u201d Steven Waits, president of the Oxford City Council, said the measure was a response to complaints from residents after retailer Target last week said transgender people and customers could use store bathrooms that matched the gender with which they identify, the Anniston Star reported. Waits said the council adopted the law \u201cnot out of concerns for the 0.3 percent of the population who identify as transgender,\u201d but \u201cto protect our women and children,\u201d according to the newspaper. Waits did not reply to a request for comment from Reuters. Strangio said the law raises constitutional questions and the ACLU was considering taking legal action to block it. The group already has sued North Carolina over its law. ",

        "title": "Bank lobby presses for commission to lead consumer watchdog agency",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bank lobbying groups are pressing the U.S. Senate to once again work on reforming the country\u2019s consumer financial watchdog agency - but this time around they may see those changes become reality. In a letter to Senate leaders released on Wednesday the groups, including the Consumer Bankers Association and the Credit Union National Association, called for legislation to change the leadership of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from a single director to a five-member commission, which they say would make the agency more accountable. They also asked Congress to void the CFPB\u2019s recent rule on prepaid cards and halt work on regulations for mandatory arbitration, payday lending, and third-party debt collection using a law known as the Congressional Review Act. The CFPB\u2019s sole director has \u201cunprecedented authority over financial institutions, with minimal oversight,\u201d they wrote in the letter, which was also signed by the Independent Community Bankers of America and the National Association of Federal Credit Unions. The director\u2019s power to both create regulations and carry out enforcements, including levying million-dollar fines, can \u201chave sweeping and longlasting effects,\u201d the groups wrote. Many have supported commission leadership since the CFPB was first created in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to protect everyday consumers from bad actors in the areas of mortgages, student loans, credit cards and banks. Recently, the CFPB and other agencies fined Wells Fargo & Co $185 million for creating fake accounts. Republicans drafted the first Senate bill to change the CFPB, currently headed by Richard Cordray, in 2012 and then introduced similar legislation in the following three years. In the House of Representatives, the Financial Services Committee recently approved a sweeping bill to also create a commission to run the agency. Democratic President Barack Obama has stood in the way of establishing a commission with his veto pen. President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, is expected to support changes. The single-director structure allows the CFPB to move quickly and eliminates the risk of protracted fights among commission members, proponents say. A three-judge panel in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia recently agreed the director has too much power, although it ruled that could be remedied by allowing the president to fire the director without cause.  The government petitioned the entire court for a review of the decision. The court has signaled it will vote on the petition before Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration, and many expect it will go ahead with the review. In an unusual step revealing the case\u2019s importance, it asked the solicitor general to file a separate brief. Lawyers say the separate brief may be a form of due diligence, showing the court has heard all sides. Or, it could be a way to \u201clock in\u201d the current administration\u2019s opinion to create consistency with the next one. The solicitor general under Trump would represent the CFPB if the case goes to the Supreme Court. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - A graffiti artist lampooned Maine Governor Paul LePage in a mural depicting the two-term Republican wearing a Ku Klux Klan cape and hood, two weeks after he left a profane voicemail for a Democratic lawmaker he believed had called him a racist. The mural, which appeared over the weekend in Portland on a wall where graffiti is allowed by law, has been repainted to remove the reference to the white supremacist group, with the hood replaced with Mickey Mouse ears and a new caption \u201cno hate\u201d joining the existing \u201cracist homophobe moron governor,\u201d in which the word \u201cgovernor\u201d was struck through. Lawmakers from both parties last week contemplated calling a special session to rebuke LePage, whose term extends through 2018, for the message, in which he called a lawmaker a \u201clittle son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker.\u201d That effort collapsed with the two sides unable to agree on the details of how long the special session would last or what its precise objectives were, with Democrats calling for impeachment, further than Republicans were willing to go. \u201cI think it was a lot of work but I think a lot of people are pretty upset about how things are going,\u201d Falmouth resident Emily Hickey told Maine CBS affiliate WGME as she viewed the mural. Tom Poulin, of Oakland, Maine, said he believed the painting was in poor taste. \u201cYou can have your personal thoughts about somebody but to say them like that is a little ridiculous,\u201d he told WGME. Portland Mayor Ethan Strimling, a Democrat, said on Twitter that he had asked city officials to take down the mural. \u201cAs much as we are all infuriated by the governor\u2019s statements, equating his language to the systemic terrorism and murder Grand Wizards inflicted upon African Americans (and Catholics) trivializes the KKK,\u201d Strimling said. A spokeswoman for LePage did not immediately respond to a request for comment. LePage has faced a flurry of criticism over the past two weeks for saying that members of minority groups from out of state were responsible for the lion\u2019s share of the heroin trade in Maine. He drew further criticism after the widely circulated voicemail. ",

        "title": "South African commission urges more education spending before ratings reviews",
        "text": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa should raise state spending on higher education by around a third to at least 1 percent of gross domestic product, a report commissioned by the presidency and released on Monday found. The recommendation by the commission appointed by President Jacob Zuma came as a senior Treasury official resigned after news reports said he had complained about presidential interference in the budget process, and as state-owned utility Eskom said it was facing serious liquidity issues. South Africa relies on foreign investors to finance its hefty budget and current account deficits. Investors are nervous ahead of important credit rating reviews scheduled this month and with the ruling African National Congress gearing up to elect Zuma s successor as party chief in December. The presidency said on Monday that Zuma would make an announcement on the higher education report once ministers had processed its findings. Zuma set up the commission early last year in response to protests by university students demanding free education. The rand and benchmark bonds weakened after the presidency said it would publish the report on Monday, but they were little changed after its release. Currency traders and analysts said markets were waiting to see how the presidency would react to the report, but they said its recommendations were risky from an economic standpoint.  If we start repeating this pattern of recording higher and higher budget deficits we are undoubtedly headed for downgrades,  said senior Nedbank economist Nicky Weimar. South African GDP was around 4.3 trillion rand ($296.6 billion) last year, so an increase in government spending on higher education of 0.25 percent of GDP would amount to around $750 million of additional expenditure.  The commission also recommended that all university students should be funded through a cost-sharing model, whereby the government would guarantee income-contingent loans issued by commercial banks. Should a student fail to reach a certain income level, the state should repay the tuition loan, it advised. Introducing those measures would make it more difficult for Treasury to rein in a projected budget deficit of over 4 percent of GDP for the 2017/18 fiscal year.  But it would be popular among young people and ANC voters, many of whom are dissatisfied that South African society remains deeply unequal more than two decades after the end of apartheid in 1994. South Africa next holds a national election in 2019, and the ANC has seen its electoral majority shrink in elections. South African markets have also been pressured by fears that the independence of financial institutions is under threat. Local media outlet Fin24 cited sources on Monday as saying that Treasury Deputy Director-General Michael Sachs had resigned last week after complaining that Zuma was interfering in the budget process. Treasury confirmed Sachs  resignation, saying only that his departure was because he wanted to  serve the public sector in a different capacity . International ratings agencies downgraded South Africa s debt earlier this year after Zuma fired respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan in an abrupt cabinet reshuffle. S&P Global and Moody s are expected to review the country s ratings again on Nov. 24, and all eyes are on whether they will downgrade its local-currency rating to  junk  status after Gordhan s replacement, Malusi Gigaba, unveiled dismal medium-term budget forecasts last month. Downgrades to sub-investment grade could trigger forced selling of up to $12 billion of South African bonds and pile further pressure on the rand, which is already trading at a 12-month low against the dollar. South Africa s debt insurance costs hit a four-month high on Monday, reflecting a greater likelihood of ratings downgrades.     ",

        "text": "OSLO (Reuters) - Norway s Christian Democratic party withdrew from coalition talks with the government on Wednesday, ending Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg s hopes of broadening her minority right-wing cabinet into a center-right majority one. The move may make it more difficult for Solberg to secure backing for her fiscal spending plans and policy proposals, and could even jeopardize her cabinet s long-term survival. Solberg has ruled in a minority government since 2013 with the populist Progress Party. She had hoped to bring the two parties  other backers in parliament, the Christian Democrats and the Liberals, into her cabinet after the four parties combined won a renewed but smaller majority on Sept. 11. While Solberg had needed the support of just one of the two centrist parties previously to push through her policies, she now needs the backing of both in addition to that of her own Conservatives and the Progress Party. But the Christian Democrats, wary of supporting further tax cuts and the government s tough line on immigration, said it would stay out of government even though it preferred Solberg as prime minister over Labour leader Jonas Gahr Stoere. Solberg had previously rejected a proposal from the Liberals and the Christian Democrats to remove Progress from the government in favor of the centrists.  Our alternative for a government did not succeed, but we still wish for good, constructive cooperation,  party leader Knut Arild Hareide of the Christian Democrats told reporters after meeting the three other parties on Wednesday. The Liberals will continue to negotiate with the government, but their potential inclusion in the cabinet would not be sufficient to ensure a majority. The government is due to present its 2018 fiscal spending proposal on Oct. 12 and must negotiate a compromise in parliament by late November or early December. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said on Thursday they would leave White House advisory councils after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Trump decided to pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement designed to fight climate change despite entreaties from U.S. allies and corporate leaders in an action that fulfilled a major campaign pledge.  \u201cClimate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\u201d Musk said in a Twitter post. He is a member of the President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, a business advisory group, and Trump\u2019s manufacturing jobs council.  Musk said on Wednesday that he had done \u201call I can\u201d to convince Trump to stay in the accord, and threatened to leave the presidential advisory councils if Trump announced a U.S. exit from the accord. Iger wrote on Twitter that \u201cas a matter of principle, I\u2019ve resigned from the President\u2019s Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal.\u201d He is leaving the business advisory group. Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council in February amid pressure from activists and employees who opposed the administration\u2019s immigration policies. Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The group is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP and includes Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo Inc and Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co . Late on Thursday, BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said he would continue to serve on Trump\u2019s CEO Forum,  despite reservations about the White House decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.     \u201cI accepted the invitation to serve on the President\u2019s CEO Forum because I believe I can contribute to the policy dialogue in Washington and serve as a voice for investors,\u201d Fink said in a statement.  \u201cI am a strong believer that our industry needs to have a voice with governments around the world,\u201d said Fink, whose company is the world\u2019s largest asset manager, with $5.4 trillion under management. \u201cI do not agree with all of the president\u2019s policies and decisions, including today\u2019s announcement to exit the U.S. from the Paris Agreement which I believe is a critical step forward in addressing climate change.\u201d Asked about Musk\u2019s resignation, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox News that \u201canybody who read the agreement and understood it would realize that this was not really about climate, this was about U.S. money going to other countries and it didn\u2019t solve the climate problem.\u201d Musk has met with Trump several times and spoken with him  about the long-term goal of his company SpaceX for flights to Mars carrying humans. The White House is planning to a hold a meeting with technology leaders on June 19, an administration spokesman said Wednesday. General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra would remain on the presidential advisory panel, adding that her participation \u201cprovides GM a seat at an important table to contribute to a constructive dialogue about key policy issues.\u201d In 2013, GM signed a declaration joining other major companies arguing that responding to climate change was good business. The automaker said on Thursday that despite the withdrawal it \u201cwill not waver from our commitment to the environment.\u201d It was unclear whether Ford Motor Co\u2019s new chief executive, James Hackett, would join Trump\u2019s panel.

        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicans packed churches on Sunday to pray for the victims of the country s deadliest quake in 32 years as rescue teams searched against the odds for any survivors trapped under rubble since Tuesday s tremor shook Mexico City and nearby states. As another aftershock jolted southwestern Mexico on Sunday, the death toll from Tuesday s 7.1 magnitude earthquake climbed to 320 people. With thousands of buildings damaged, survivors slept on the street outside their homes and estimates of the cost of the earthquake ran as high as $8 billion. Many have been traumatized by the second major quake to strike Mexico City in their lifetime after a devastating 1985 tremor killed an estimated 10,000 people. In the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the national shrine of the majority Roman Catholic country, thousands of people gathered to pray.   I came to ask God for strength for those who lost loved ones and for the Virgin to watch over us and keep us safe,  said 69-year-old Maria Gema Ortiz.  Thanks to all those who came from other countries to help. Thanks to all and long live Mexico!  Makeshift places of worship have popped up next to the crumbling cement and mangled steel of collapsed buildings in the deeply religious country. In upscale Roma, one of the hardest-hit neighborhoods of the capital, a priest led mass for nearly two dozen people under a blue tarp while a nun handed out small cards with an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, who according to the Catholic faith first appeared to an Aztec convert in 1531. More than 44,000 public schools in six states were due to reopen on Monday, but only 103 of the 4,000 public schools in Mexico City would open so as not to impede rescue and relief efforts. In addition, the National Autonomous University of Mexico, with 350,000 students at campuses in and around Mexico City, will resume classes on Monday. Like many Mexicans, 36-year-old Claudia Avila was determined to return to some semblance of normality.  We are afraid, but life must go on,  said Avila, whose sons are 9 and 16.  Tomorrow I will take my children back to school. They know that if something happens, they must protect themselves. It has been a rude awakening.  Rescuers narrowed their search to a handful of buildings in the sprawling metropolitan area of 20 million people, using advanced audio equipment to detect signs of life beneath tonnes of rubble, with help from teams from as far afield as Israel and Japan.  The search and rescue in Mexico City continues as a priority, with cooperation from national and international groups,  tweeted Miguel Angel Mancera, Mexico City s mayor. The search for survivors continued in a ruined office building in the Roma neighborhood and in a five-story apartment building in historic Tlalpan. Authorities called off efforts in the upper-middle class Linda Vista zone after pulling 10 bodies from the rubble, while work at the Tlalpan building was briefly halted on Saturday by a magnitude 6.2 aftershock. Roberto Hernandez, 62, leading a group of Mexico s famed  mole  rescue workers at the collapsed office building in Roma, said he believed 30 people were trapped in the rubble, though it was not clear how many were sill alive.  We can t guarantee there is life but we can guarantee we ll turn over every last stone,  Hernandez said.     Tuesday s quake, which flattened dozens of structures in Mexico City, was the second major earthquake to strike the country of 127 million people this month.  A massive 8.1 magnitude quake on Sept. 7 off the southwestern coast of Mexico killed around 100 people, most of them in the nearby states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. A series of aftershocks since then have sown panic. The latest tremor, of 5.7 magnitude, struck on Sunday off the west coast, with its epicenter 80 km (50 miles) south-southwest of Tonala, in Chiapas, the U.S. Geological Survey said. There were no immediate reports of significant damage. Many more quakes are likely, warned Xyoli Perez Campos, director of Mexico s National Seismological Service.  We have already recorded more than 4,300 aftershocks,  Campos said.  So more aftershocks are to come. What we don t know is if they are going to be of significant magnitude.   President Enrique Pena Nieto visited 12 communities in Mexico state, which borders the capital city, promising that aid would be directed only to those truly affected by the quake and that the government would help rebuild homes and businesses.  I am publicly promising that ... the affected homes, the families affected and the people in the whole of Joquicingo and the state of Mexico, get back on their feet,  he said from that town. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is set to toast the five leaders of Nordic nations at a lavish state dinner at the White House on Friday, an unusual summit aimed in part at sending a message to a nation not on the guest list: Russia. Obama will laud the humanitarian and environmental accomplishments of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland, but also wants to talk about how to deal with their increasingly aggressive neighbor Russia ahead of a NATO summit in July. \u201cWe share the concern of countries in the region, particularly those who have a border with Russia, about the increasing presence of Russian military assets in the area,\u201d said Charles Kupchan, Obama\u2019s senior director for European affairs. \u201cWe will be discussing ways to enhance the security of the region, writ large, and also what we can do through dialogue and diplomacy to urge Russia to be more transparent and to be more restrained and careful in its military exercises,\u201d Kupchan told reporters. Obama last met Nordic leaders in Stockholm in 2013 on his way to a G20 summit in St. Petersburg after canceling a planned bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin because of tensions over Syria and surveillance issues. Since then, Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region, prompting Nordic nations to step up their military cooperation and the United States to boost military spending to help NATO do more to try to deter Russia. During a recent visit to Europe, Obama sought to reassure allies about the U.S. commitment to the continent, but pushed nations to increase their defense spending and stay united amid the strain of dealing with an influx of migrants fleeing Middle East conflicts. The leaders will discuss a long-term approach for dealing with refugees, Kupchan said, as well as new contributions to the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq. He declined comment on specific commitments from the meeting. Typically, the White House rolls out the red carpet for one leader at a time. Friday will be a bit trickier, juggling five guests of honor and their entourages. The state dinner itself will be in a large tent with a transparent ceiling evoking the northern lights and \u201cshadowy spaces in the arctic night,\u201d the White House told reporters. Guests will sit at long, rustic wooden tables bedecked with columns of ice, fiddlehead ferns, and fragrant hand-rolled beeswax candles, and dine on braised Nebraska beef short ribs and salt-cured Atlantic ahi tuna served in a large ice cube.  The summit is expected to be heavy on \u201cfeel-good\u201d messages about the outsized role Nordic nations play in international diplomacy, said Julie Smith, a former Obama administration official now with the Center for a New American Security. \u201cIn many ways, the actual visit is the deliverable,\u201d Smith said, noting it was unlikely major new initiatives would emerge. \u201cWe\u2019re at the end of the president\u2019s tenure so there are limits on what new things he can drive forward,\u201d Smith said. In Washington, preparations for the leaders\u2019 arrival have been overshadowed by a visit by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to meet with congressional leaders as the race intensifies to replace Obama in the White House in the Nov. 8 election. Trump has said NATO is obsolete and European nations should look after their own defense, which has sparked concern among Nordic nations, said Heather Conley, a former State Department official in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThey hear with great clarity the statements of Donald Trump and they don\u2019t know exactly how this is going to work in November,\u201d said Conley, now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Norway\u2019s Prime Minister Erna Solberg plans to stress the importance of American participation in NATO for Nordic nations, she said in an interview this week with the Norwegian daily Aftenposten. \u201cWith an unpredictable Russian presence in the northern areas, it\u2019s important that the Americans have a focus on the Arctic regions,\u201d Solberg said.

        "title": "Singer Jennifer Holliday pulls out of Trump inauguration event",
        "text": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Broadway star Jennifer Holliday said on Saturday she was pulling out of a concert celebrating the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, citing an online article that cast the performance as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of her gay and lesbian fans. The Tony Award-winning singer, best known for her roles in the Broadway musicals \u201cDreamgirls\u201d and \u201cYour Arms Too Short to Box with God,\u201d announced the cancellation in a letter first published by The Wrap, an entertainment industry news website. \u201cI sincerely apologize for my lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues that affect every American at this crucial time in history and for causing such dismay and heartbreak to my fans,\u201d Holliday said in the letter, which was released to Reuters by her representatives. Holliday was not scheduled to perform at Friday\u2019s inauguration itself but at an event at the Lincoln Memorial the night before called the \u201cMake America Great Again! Welcome Celebration.\u201d  Also scheduled to appear are country music star Toby Keith, rock band 3 Doors Down and Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight. The Trump transition team referred questions to the Presidential Inaugural Committee, which did not comment directly on Holliday\u2019s letter. \u201cAs Americans from across the country unite to celebrate the 58th Presidential Inaugural, we are humbled by the outpouring of support we are receiving and are honored to have so many world-class performers taking part in this historic celebration of freedom and democracy,\u201d Boris Epshteyn, director of communications for the Presidential Inaugural Committee, said in a written statement.  In a column for the Daily Beast website, entertainment reporter Kevin Fallon called Holliday a gay icon for her work on Broadway and said that Trump had surrounded himself with politicians who vocally oppose lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. \u201cFor the gay community that has bolstered Holliday\u2019s, in her own words, embattled and difficult career, and cheered on her recent successes, the news (of Holliday\u2019s planned performance) feels like a betrayal. It is heartbreaking,\u201d Fallon wrote on Friday. In her letter, Holliday wrote that she had originally agreed to perform for Trump as a \u201cbi-partisan songbird\u201d who had sung for four presidents, both Republican and Democratic, dating back to Ronald Reagan. \u201cI was honestly just thinking that I wanted my voice to be\u00a0a healing and unifying force for hope through music to help our deeply polarized country,\u201d Holliday wrote.  \u201cRegretfully, I did not take into consideration that my performing for the concert would actually instead be taken as a political act against my own personal beliefs and be mistaken for support of Donald Trump and Mike Pence,\u201d she said. In addition to her career on Broadway, Holliday has found success on the pop charts and as a Gospel singer.  She won a Tony Award in 1982 for her role as Effie White in the original production of \u201cDreamgirls\u201d and two Grammy Awards later that decade. ",

        "title": "Brazil Supreme Court allows Congress last word on removal of lawmakers",
        "text": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil s Supreme Court on Wednesday decided to grant Congress the final word on decisions to remove a sitting politician, conceding a victory to lawmakers fighting to shield themselves from prosecution for corruption. The narrow 6-5 decision will allow the Senate to vote next week to revoke a top court ruling that suspended Senator Aecio Neves who is being investigated in seven corruption cases. A majority of the justices decided to back off from confrontation with Congress in the midst of Brazil s biggest political corruption scandal, which has even implicated President Michel Temer and his inner circle of cabinet ministers. The lower house of Congress is expected to vote later this month to shelve charges against Temer in a corruption case involving meatpacker JBS SA, saving him from trial by the Supreme Court. More than 110 politicians are targeted by the sprawling Car Wash graft investigation that has uncovered since 2014 a massive network of bribes and kickbacks paid by companies seeking to win government contracts and influence legislation. Congress has pushed back against judicial action by the Supreme Court since the justices ordered the removal of the former speaker of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha, who was  arrested last year, convicted of corruption and sentenced to more than 15 years in prison for corruption. One third of the politicians in Brazil s Congress - more than 230 - including more than half of its senators, are being investigated for breaking the law and face trial by the Supreme Court, the only court that can try lawmakers and ministers. Those being investigated include the presidents of the Senate and the lower house, and many of the leaders of Temer s governing coalition. In another gain for the political class, the Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that no one can be charged merely on the basis of plea bargain testimony by just one witness if no evidence is provided to back up the accusation. Plea deals have been the main tool used by anti-corruption prosecutors to track the network of political kickbacks and   dismantle graft schemes discovered at oil company Petrobras and other state-run enterprises. The ruling was part of a decision to throw out corruption and money laundering charges against Senator Renan Calheiros, the former president of the Senate who faces seven other graft investigations.

        "title": "Questions on free movement, red tape linger in Brexit citizens' deal",
        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s agreement with the European Union over key Brexit terms still leaves major issues like freedom of movement undecided, some campaigners said on Friday. Prime Minister Theresa May and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker unveiled an agreement earlier on the Irish border, citizens  rights and the Brexit bill, opening the way for talks on trade and a transition period. While the status of the EU s only land border with the United Kingdom was perhaps the thorniest issue, the deal safeguarding the rights of 3 million EU citizens in Britain and around 1.2 million Britons living elsewhere in the EU will affect households across the continent. London and Brussels agreed to offer equal treatment in social security, health care, employment and education and to let British judges ask the European Court of Justice to weigh in when necessary for eight years after Brexit. But Jane Golding, who heads British in Europe, a coalition of 10 citizens  groups representing around 35,000 Britons living in the rest of the bloc, said fundamental issues had not been dealt with.   The really big one is free movement, and we are worried that that is just simply going to be deferred until the next phase,  Golding, a Briton who has lived in Berlin for nine years, told Reuters.  In future, if you don t have the right of free movement, the right to go and work and live in those other countries and have your qualifications recognized in those other countries, you could be passed up for those opportunities, and that s going to impact your career,  she said. EU and British officials say that British citizens on the continent will, as things stand, only have rights in the member state they are living in on the day of Brexit.  However, the two sides are prepared to negotiate further on this next year.  Britain, for example, had earlier offered a lifetime guarantee of residence rights but that is, for the time being, off the table, with people losing those rights if they leave the country for five years. However, that is an area where both sides may continue to look for tradeoffs.  Getting a deal that works is crucial to both Britain, the world s sixth-largest economy, and the EU, the world s biggest trading bloc. Britons hold positions in major businesses across the continent and take advantage of overseas study schemes such as Erasmus, while tens of thousands of elderly people rely on EU agreements for access to public services and their pensions in countries such as Spain. EU citizens fill key roles in Britain s state-run health service, construction sector and many professional jobs, with British business leaders keen to retain unfettered access to the continent s labor market. Nicolas Hatton, co-chair of campaign group the3million, said he was unhappy that the deal backed Britain s stance of making EU citizens apply to remain in the country.  All EU citizens here will need to apply to stay, while so far we were granted residents  rights,  he told Reuters.  This application process will be made with the Home Office and with the current hostile environment policy ... We are very worried. There will be errors, there will be mistakes, people will be affected by these mistakes,  he said. Responding to fears of overly bureaucratic barriers, Friday s joint report from the negotiators emphasized that the process for applying to remain will be as transparent and easy as possible.   Application forms will be short, simple, user-friendly and adjusted to the context of the Withdrawal Agreement,  it reads. But Britons in the EU face uncertainty as to what the process may involve in different member states, while Europeans in Britain have complained about the need to fill in an 85-page application form for residency and to produce tax returns and provide details of their movements over the last five years.  At an early morning media conference in Brussels, May offered reassurance to Europeans:  They will be able to go on living their lives as before,  she said. ",

        "title": "Trump seeks legislative wins to cast off shadow of Russia probes",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump pressed Republican congressional leaders on Tuesday to complete their overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system as lawmakers said they were making progress on a contentious effort that threatens to overwhelm their legislative agenda.  In a White House meeting, Trump welcomed indications by senior Republicans that the Senate might vote on a healthcare bill in July, before it breaks for the summer, after the House of Representatives passed its own version in May. \u201cNow the Senate I\u2019m sure will follow suit and get a bill across the finish line this summer that will be great healthcare and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing it,\u201d Trump said. The gathering included Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and his No. 2, Senator John Cornyn, along with House Speaker Paul Ryan and his deputies, Representatives Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise. Buffeted by criticism on many fronts, Trump wants faster action from his fellow Republicans who control Congress, pressing lawmakers to finish the job of dismantling the Obamacare healthcare law and move on quickly to another of his priorities: tax cuts. McConnell said Senate Republicans are \u201cgetting close\u201d to a healthcare plan after he presented an outline at a lunchtime meeting but he declined to say when he might bring it up for a vote. Other senior Republicans say they hope to vote by early July. \u201cThe leader would like to do this soon,\u201d Senator Orrin Hatch told reporters. The Senate requires a 60-vote supermajority to advance most legislation but Republican Mike Enzi, head of the Senate Budget Committee, said the health bill that passed the House qualifies for an expedited process that would require only 51 votes. Still, Republicans have little margin for error because they only control 52 seats in the 100-seat chamber and remain divided over key questions such as how quickly to scale back the Medicaid health plan for the poor. \u201cYou have to get 50 people - that means they have to get me and a lot of people who are concerned about Medicaid,\u201d said Senator Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia, a state that depends heavily on the program. Medicaid was expanded under Obamacare but the House bill would phase that expansion out in 2020. The Senate bill might keep the expansion in place beyond that date, said Republican Senator John Barrasso. Whatever the White House\u2019s efforts to push ahead with policy plans, there will be a spotlight on testimony by James Comey, the FBI director fired by Trump last month, to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. Senators will question Comey on whether Trump tried to get him to back off an FBI investigation into ties between the president\u2019s 2016 campaign and Russia, an attempt that critics have said could constitute obstruction of justice. Trump denies any collusion with Russia and has called the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d The Justice Department has appointed a special counsel to oversee its probe into the Russia issue and several congressional panels also are investigating the matter.   Elected on pledges to overhaul the healthcare system and slash taxes, Trump has yet to achieve a major legislative win, and time is running out before lawmakers leave Washington for the August break. There has been little progress on healthcare since the House passed its bill. McConnell told Reuters late last month he did not yet know how to amass the votes needed to pass a bill on  healthcare. He appeared to make some progress on Tuesday. Some Republican lawmakers praised an outline that McConnell presented at a lunchtime meeting, although they cautioned that much work remained to be done.  Senator Bill Cassidy said the plan offered more protections than the House bill for people who already have pre-existing illnesses when they apply for insurance coverage - a major point of contention. \u201cI think personally they are moving in the right direction,\u201d he said. The House healthcare bill could result in 23 million people losing insurance, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bill also would reduce federal deficits by $119 billion between 2017 and 2026, according to the analysis.  Congress might then turn its focus to overhauling the tax code in September. While the administration would prefer that such changes not add to the national debt, Marc Short, Trump\u2019s top aide on Capitol Hill, told reporters on Monday that the top priority would be cutting taxes. The Trump administration has outlined a broad plan that would cut tax rates for businesses and streamline the tax system for individuals. The proposal has been short on details, including how much the tax cuts would cost and what loopholes would be closed. Others are eager to move past healthcare as well. \u201cWe need to bring this to an end and move to taxes,\u201d said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. ",

        "text": "SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - China will allow travel agencies in Beijing and Shandong to partly resume sales of group tours to South Korea, in a sign of thawing relations between the nations that have been locked in a year-long diplomatic standoff. However, executives from tour agencies in the regions said they had been told not to include in their travel packages units of South Korean retail-to-chemicals giant Lotte Group - which provided land for the installation of a U.S.-backed anti-missile system that Beijing vehemently opposed. China had banned all group tours to the neighboring country since March in the wake of South Korea s decision to install the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system. Beijing worries the THAAD s powerful radar can penetrate Chinese territory. In South Korea, a halving of inbound Chinese tourists in the first nine months of the year cost the economy $6.5 billion in lost revenue based on the average spending of Chinese visitors in 2016, official data shows. But a late October agreement between the countries to move past the dispute had boosted hopes group tours may be allowed in the near future. [L3N1NE1MN]  China National Tourism Administration will allow resumption of only over-the-counter sales of package tours from Beijing and Shandong to South Korea, Park Yong-hwan, deputy director at Korea Tourism Organization, and executives at Chinese travel agencies said on Tuesday. Online sales of package tours, and chartering flights or cruise trips are still banned, Park said. According to the executives at travel agencies, restrictions on including Lotte Group units, such as Lotte Duty Free, in tour packages also remain. The executives declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.  Lotte, South Korea s No.5 conglomerate, has faced a major setback in the wake of deteriorating bilateral relations, with most of its hypermarkets in China being shut down after fire inspections. The South Korean travel ban is expected to be be in place for other Chinese regions for now and be gradually lifted going forward, Park said.  Shares in South Korean tourism and retail companies rallied after the news of the partial lifting of the ban, first reported by Yonhap earlier in the day. Asiana Airlines gained 3.1 percent and duty free store operator Hotel Shilla rose 2.8 percent. Casino operator Paradise rose 2.2 percent, while cosmetics maker LG Household & Health Care added 3.7 percent.  ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett bemoaned the \u201cnegative drumbeat\u201d on the U.S. economy from presidential candidates in his annual Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholder letter on Saturday, saying they are misleading Americans into believing their children will be worse off than they are. \u201cIt\u2019s an election year, and candidates can\u2019t stop speaking about our country\u2019s problems (which, of course, only they can solve),\u201d Buffett wrote, italicizing \u201cthey\u201d for emphasis. As a result of their dour outlook on the U.S. economy, many Americans now believe that their children will not live as prosperously as they themselves do, the 85-year-old Buffett said. \u201cThat view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history,\u201d Buffett said. Buffett did not single out any presidential candidates by name. The billionaire in December officially threw his backing behind Hillary Clinton, a Democrat. \u201cDuring presidential elections where no incumbent is running, both sides who are running for president always say they are the ones to solve the nation\u2019s problems and point out what those problems are,\u201d said Bill Smead, who invests $2.1 billion at Smead Capital Management in Seattle. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who won New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s endorsement on Friday, has offered  a bleak assessment of the U.S. economy, repeatedly saying it is in a \u201cbubble\u201d that he hopes will pop before he takes office. \u201cI don\u2019t want to inherit all this stuff,\u201d he has said. In his letter, Buffett said \u201csome commentators bemoan our current 2 percent per year growth\u201d in real gross domestic product, \u201cand, yes, we would all like to see a higher rate.\u201d But he said America\u2019s population is growing about 0.8 percent per year, and that 2 percent GDP growth equates to a 1.2 percent per capita growth rate. \u201cThat may not sound impressive,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cBut in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34.4 percent in real GDP per capita.\u201d Buffett, whose home in Omaha, Nebraska sits on less than an acre, said society has advanced significantly since he grew up during and after the Great Depression. \u201cAll families in my upper middle-class neighborhood regularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by John D. Rockefeller Sr. at the time of my birth,\u201d he said. \u201cHis unparalleled fortune couldn\u2019t buy what we now take for granted, whether the field is \u2013 to name just a few \u2013 transportation, entertainment, communication or medical services. Rockefeller certainly had power and fame; he could not, however, live as well as my neighbors now do.\u201d All told, Buffett said it is not a good idea to listen to these presidential candidates\u2019 negative outlooks.  \u201cFor 240 years it\u2019s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica\u2019s golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs. America\u2019s social security promises will be honored and perhaps made more generous. And, yes, America\u2019s kids will live far better than their parents did.\u201d  (Reporting By Jennifer Ablan and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Nick Zieminski) This article was funded in part by SAP.

        "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russia proposed a two-day ceasefire on Monday in the last major rebel stronghold near the Syrian capital Damascus, where warplanes killed at least 41 people in two days of air strikes as Russian-backed government forces tried to capture the area. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring body, said 18 people were killed by bombing on Monday and 23 on Sunday. At least 147 have been killed by air strikes and shelling since the Syrian army, with Russian air power, began the offensive to take the besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghouta nearly two weeks ago. The area of densely-populated agricultural land is the last major territory near the capital still held by rebels fighting against President Bashar al-Assad s government. Across Syria, fighters have been driven out of most towns and cities in the past two years since Russia joined the war on Assad s behalf. Eastern Ghouta is also one of several  de-escalation zones  across western Syria where Russia has brokered deals to ease fighting. Russia proposed imposing a ceasefire in the de-escalation zone for Tuesday and Wednesday, Interfax news agency reported, quoting the Defence Ministry.  Such measures will ease tension in the western part of the de-escalation zone,  General-Lieutenant Sergei Kuralenko, in charge of Russia s ceasefire monitoring center in Syria, was quoted as saying. The enclave has been besieged by Assad forces since 2012, but the siege has become far worse in recent months since routes used to smuggle in food were shut. Residents are so short of food that they are eating trash, fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days, the U.N. World Food Programme said in a report last week. On Monday, 13 shells hit government-held Damascus and its surrounding areas, Syrian state media SANA reported. Four people were injured from a shell that hit the capital on Sunday, SANA said. ",

        "text": "LOME (Reuters) - Security forces in Togo used batons, tear gas and live bullets against protesters seeking an end to President Faure Gnassingbe s rule on Wednesday and a child was killed in the ensuing clashes, according to Amnesty International. Tensions are mounting over the president s tenure and thousands marched nationwide against government reforms announced on Tuesday which they say will allow the Gnassingbe family dynasty to run the West African country until 2030.  There was a 9-year-old boy killed in Mango by military forces. He was shot in the head,  said Francois Patuel, of Amnesty International, citing local sources including family members. Security Minister Damehame Yark confirmed that a child had been shot dead in Mango, hundreds of kilometres north of the capital Lome, but blamed the PNP opposition party. Riots also broke out in the northern city of Bafilo between protesters against Gnassingbe and his supporters, injuring several, opposition leader Jean-Pierre Fabre said at the end of a peaceful march in Lome. The former French colony of 8 million people that is home to several large firms, including Ecobank and regional airline ASKY, has a history of violent political repression. Hundreds were killed in the aftermath of Gnassingbe s contested election win in 2005. Shortly afterward, he pledged to re-introduce the term limits his father scrapped and align Togo with most of its West African neighbors, which are bucking a trend toward life-long presidencies elsewhere on the continent. Gnassingbe, now in his third term, dropped the reforms until parliament this week attempted to cap future presidencies to two terms of five years, but the bill did not get enough backing due to an opposition boycott and will be decided by referendum instead. In Lome, people wearing the red and orange T-shirts of the opposition banged on tam-tams and sang a traditional battle song  Strength to the Great  in the local Ewe language. Others carried a giant banner saying:  People of Togo say No! 50 years is enough!   The referendum is not what we want. We are asking for the president to leave,  said 42-year-old Paulin Kossi.  Nearby, a large crowd gathered on a beachside boulevard to show their support for the UNIR ruling party while a motorcycle parade bearing flags with Gnassingbe s snaked through the streets, flanked by a police escort. Residents also complained of internet cuts - a method increasingly used by governments to stifle criticism at sensitive times. Protests both against and in support of the president are set to resume on Thursday. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A diplomatic crisis between the United States and Turkey that led them to stop issuing visas to each other s citizens is  overblown  and will likely be resolved soon, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said on Wednesday. In remarks apparently aimed at defusing tensions between the two countries, Simsek told an event in Washington that Turkey considered the safety and security of U.S. diplomats and employees in Turkey a  top priority  and described the detention of staff at U.S. missions in Turkey as  routine  investigations.  Tensions between the two NATO allies rose in recent days after the detentions of two locally employed staff prompted the United States on Sunday to suspend non-immigrant visa services at its embassy and consulates in Turkey. Hours later, Turkey issued a similar suspension on visas for U.S. citizens.  U.S.-Turkish relations were already strained over U.S. military support for Kurdish fighters in Syria and the United States  unwillingness to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former Erdogan ally whom Ankara views as the mastermind behind last year s failed military coup.  We don t want this dispute to last more than a second,  Simsek said of the current visa spat at a briefing on U.S. business opportunities in Turkey at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday. He added that Turkey is committed to  safeguarding  U.S. government employees in Turkey. Simsek s remarks contrasted with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan s statements on Tuesday that  agents  had infiltrated U.S. missions in Turkey and that Ankara no longer recognized U.S. Ambassador John Bass as a legitimate envoy.  Bass told reporters on Wednesday the U.S. government had still not received any official explanation from the Turkish government for why the employees were arrested in Turkey this year. When a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration worker was detained in Istanbul last week, Erdogan s spokesman said the employee had been in contact with a leading suspect in last July s failed coup. Since the abortive putsch, in which at least 240 people were killed, more than 50,000 people have been detained and 150,000, including teachers, academics, soldiers and journalists, have been suspended from work. Simsek on Wednesday dismissed concerns expressed by some Western allies that the crackdown shows Turkey is slipping into authoritarian rule under Erdogan.  Turkey is not doing arbitrary arrests. There are no political hostages. Give us the benefit of the doubt that Turkey s judicial system will work and is functioning,  he said. ",

At the U.S. Transportation Department, Trump said his goal was to solve \u201cone of the biggest obstacles to creating this new and desperately-needed infrastructure \u2013 and that is the painfully slow, costly and time-consuming process for getting permits and approvals to build.\u201d Trump said the White House is moving ahead with \u201cmassive permit reform\u201d and setting up a new council to help project managers navigate bureaucratic hurdles. \u201cThis Council will also improve transparency by creating a new online dashboard allowing everyone to easily track major projects through every stage of the approval process,\u201d Trump said. He said the council will make sure that any federal agency that \u201cconsistently delays projects by missing deadlines will face tough, new penalties.\u00a0We will hold the bureaucracy accountable.\u201d The White House is also creating a new office in the Council of Environmental Quality \u201cto root out inefficiency, clarify lines of authority, and streamline federal, state and local procedures so that communities can modernize their aging infrastructure without fear of outdated federal rules getting in the way.\u201d Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said the department is asking for public input on other changes it can make to speed approvals. Trump said it took \u201cfour years to build the Golden Gate Bridge and five years to build the Hoover Dam \u2013 but today it can take 10 years just to get the approvals and permits needed to build a major infrastructure project.\u201d The Republican president, who was a New York-based real state developer before taking office, has repeatedly decried the process of winning approval for highway permitting. \u201cIt includes 16 different approvals involving 10 different federal agencies being governed by 26 different statutes,\u201d Trump said. He spoke in front of two huge charts detailing the hurdles to build highways and held up a massive report that he said was needed before a Maryland highway was built. \u201cHow can a country prosper under such restraints?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cWhy should we continue to accept what is so clearly unacceptable? I was not elected to continue a failed system \u2013 I was elected to change it.\u201d The administration proposes $200 billion in government funding over 10 years as part of a goal of getting $1 trillion in public and private infrastructure spending.

        "text": "BOSASO, Somalia (Reuters) - Somalia s semi-autonomous region of Puntland seized a boat loaded with weapons from Yemen in Saturday s early hours, the regional maritime police chief said. Puntland authorities displayed dozens of anti-aircraft guns, machine guns, AK-47 rifles and dozens of boxes of ammunition seized from the boat after it was stopped in coastal waters off the Horn of Africa region. The journey of the small vessel, known as Al Faruq, was tracked from Yemen by European maritime forces patrolling sea lanes off Somalia, Abdirahman Mohamud Hassan, the director general of Puntland maritime police force, told Reuters. He said they had seized other boatloads of arms destined for Islamic State and al Shabaab militants active in Somalia though on this occasion the cargo was believed to be owned by arms smugglers who would have sold them at local retail outlets.   Today, we suspect traders own these weapons, but we shall investigate further,  he said. Puntland has been hit by heavy fighting in recent months as al Shabaab and a splinter group linked to Islamic State attacked government troops around the Galagala hills, 30 km southeast of the regional capital Bosaso. In June al Shabaab overran a military base in the town of Af Urur in the hills area, killing 38 people, mainly soldiers. Unlike the rest of Somalia, Puntland rarely suffered from militant attacks before the recent surge in violence, mainly because its security forces are relatively regularly paid and receive substantial U.S. assistance.

        "title": "Trump picks white-collar crime lawyer to replace Comey at FBI",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday ended a fraught month-long search for an FBI chief after firing James Comey by selecting Christopher Wray, who has prosecuted and defended white-collar crime cases and represented New Jersey\u2019s governor in a political scandal. Wray, who must be confirmed to the post by the Senate, and Comey served together in the Justice Department under former President George Bush, and both worked on the government\u2019s case in the Enron Corp fraud scandal in the early to mid-2000s. Trump\u2019s announcement that he will nominate Wray as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation came a day before Comey\u2019s eagerly anticipated public testimony before a Senate committee. In written testimony released by the panel on Wednesday, Comey said Trump told him on Jan. 27 that \u201cI expect loyalty,\u201d and in a Feb. 14 meeting asked him to back off from a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s ties with Russia. The Republican president\u2019s search for a replacement for Comey after firing him May 9 was difficult. Leading candidates including former Senator Joe Lieberman took their names out of consideration, and Trump interviewed a series of contenders. In a statement, Trump called Wray \u201can impeccably qualified individual\u201d who will serve \u201cas a fierce guardian of the law and model of integrity.\u201d The White House has given shifting explanations on why Trump fired Comey during an FBI investigation into whether Trump campaign associates colluded with the Russians to help him with the 2016 presidential election. Trump has said he was thinking of \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d in dismissing Comey. Wray served from 2003 to 2005 at the Justice Department under Republican former President George W. Bush as an assistant attorney general in charge of its criminal division and oversaw the department\u2019s Enron task force. Wray and Comey helped bring the case against Kenneth Lay, the former Enron chairman convicted in 2006. Also involved in the Enron matter was Robert Mueller, then FBI director and now special counsel named after Comey was fired to investigate the Russia affair, as well as Andrew Weissman, who is now working for Mueller. The web of Enron connections underscores the reliance in Washington, even under a president who vowed to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d on an elite corps of corporate lawyers whose varied careers often intersect and who sometimes present conflict-of-interest issues. For instance, after he left the Justice Department and joined top international law firm King & Spalding, Wray represented Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal over massive traffic jams created as political punishment for a local mayor. That case and others taken on by Wray while in private practice could pose problems, said American Civil Liberties Union National Political Director Faiz Shakir in a statement. \u201cChristopher Wray\u2019s firm\u2019s legal work for the Trump family, his history of partisan activity, as well as his history of defending Trump\u2019s transition director during a criminal scandal makes us question his ability to lead the FBI,\u201d Shakir said. Wray represented Christie in a scandal that resulted in two of the governor\u2019s aides being convicted. Christie, who was a close adviser to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign and whose name was floated as a possible Comey replacement, was never charged. Christie on Wednesday called Wray \u201can outstanding choice, a non-political choice\u201d to head the FBI. Wray works as a King & Spalding litigation partner and represents companies and individuals in a white-collar criminal and regulatory enforcement matters. King & Spalding has represented Russian companies including state gas monopoly Gazprom, according to its website. According to the website, the firm\u2019s energy practice also has represented businesses taking part in deals involving Russian entities including state-owned oil major Rosneft. The firm has previous ties to Trump. Bobby Burchfield, a partner in its Washington office, serves as ethics adviser for the trust set up in January to isolate Trump from the day-to-day operations of the Trump business organization. The agreement has been criticized by some ethics experts as inadequate. Apart from possible conflicts, another question about Wray is whether the longtime white-collar lawyer is equipped to take over an agency that is increasingly focused on detecting and combating terrorism, espionage and cybercrime. \u201cThere are questions about whether he is experienced enough in intelligence, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, computer crimes, and issues like that,\u201d said one senior U.S. law enforcement official who asked not to be identified. \u201cThe biggest test the bureau is likely to face is not another Enron,\u201d the official said. Trump announced his selection of Wray in a surprise, early-morning Twitter message. Some Democratic lawmakers said the president\u2019s timing seemed intended to distract from Comey\u2019s scheduled testimony. \u201cIt is imperative that the next FBI director be of unimpeachable integrity and independence,\u201d Nancy Pelosi, the top House of Representatives Democrat, said. \u201cIn light of the president\u2019s constant efforts to block the truth, the nomination of Christopher Wray should be subject to the utmost scrutiny.\u201d Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wray\u2019s \u201cimpressive credentials make him more than ready\u201d to lead the FBI. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said he did not know Wray but that his resume suggests he is \u201cthe perfect kind of person\u201d for the job. ",

        "title": "Nearly half of Americans oppose Republican tax bill: Reuters/Ipsos poll",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Opposition has grown among Americans to a Republican tax plan before the U.S. Congress, with 49 percent of people who were aware of the measure saying they opposed it, up from 41 percent in October, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday. Congressional Republicans are trying to rush their tax legislation to a vote on the Senate floor before the end of the week. President Donald Trump strongly backs the bill and wants to sign it into law before the end of the year. In addition to the 49 percent who said they opposed the Republican tax bill, 29 percent said they supported it and 22 percent said they \u201cdon\u2019t know,\u201d according to the Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll of 1,257 adults conducted from Thursday to Monday. When asked \u201cwho stands to benefit most\u201d from the plan, more than half of all American adults surveyed selected either the wealthy or large U.S. corporations. Fourteen percent chose \u201call Americans,\u201d 6 percent picked the middle class and 2 percent chose lower-income Americans. The tax bill being crafted in the Senate would slash the corporate tax rate, eliminate some taxes paid only by rich Americans and offer a mixed bag or temporary tax cuts for other individuals and families.  As congressional discussion on the bill has unfolded, public opposition to it has risen, on average, following Trump\u2019s unveiling of a nine-page \u201cframework\u201d on Sept. 27 that started the debate in earnest, Reuters/Ipsos polling showed. On Oct. 24, for example, among adults who said they had heard of the \u201ctax reform plan recently proposed by congressional Republicans,\u201d 41 percent said they opposed it, while 31 percent said they \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d and just 28 percent said they supported it. Trump and his fellow Republicans are determined to make a tax code overhaul their first major legislative win since taking control of the White House and Congress in January. The House of Representatives on Nov. 16 approved its own tax bill. The Senate is expected to decide on Wednesday whether to begin debating its proposal, as the measure moves toward a decisive floor vote later this week. The two chambers would need to reconcile differences between their plans before legislation could be sent to the White House for Trump\u2019s signature. In the Nov. 23-27 poll, 59 percent of Republicans supported the tax bill, 26 percent said they did not know and 15 percent opposed it. Among Democrats, 82 percent opposed it, 11 percent said they did not know and 8 percent supported it. The online poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. ",

The spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, gave no details. Officials in Trump\u2019s team said the meeting was taking place but did not elaborate. Differences between Ryan and Trump during the presidential campaign have given way to a working relationship as the Republican president-elect prepares to take office on Jan. 20. Ryan, the top House Republican, has said the two men speak almost every day. Trump has been meeting with experts, advisers and candidates for senior positions in his administration since winning the Nov. 8  election. He has nominated a dozen people already. He has yet to fill the position of secretary of state. The long list of possible candidates for that job now includes former Ford Motor Co (F.N) CEO Alan Mulally, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News on Friday.  A meeting with Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Manchin was rescheduled from Friday to Monday to accommodate work in the Senate on a government funding bill, Manchin\u2019s spokesman said.  The House passed legislation on Thursday to fund federal agencies until April 28. The bill now rests with the Senate, where Democrats are upset over the temporary, rather than long-term, extension of healthcare benefits for retired coal miners, a key constituency in Manchin\u2019s state of West Virginia.  Manchin\u2019s name has been floated as a potential pick for secretary of state or energy secretary. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s top trade adviser expressed optimism on Tuesday about reaching agreement on a revised free trade pact with South Korea, days after Trump suggested scrapping the deal with a key American ally. Senior U.S. lawmakers and America\u2019s biggest business lobby urged Trump not to pull out of the five-year-old U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS), especially at a time of heightened tensions over North Korea\u2019s nuclear missile tests. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, speaking in Mexico City after a second round of NAFTA talks with Canada and Mexico, said negotiations with Seoul were continuing. \u201cWe have a negotiation we\u2019re in,\u201d Lighthizer told reporters when asked whether KORUS would be terminated. \u201cMy hope is that we\u2019ll have a successful discussion with the Koreans as things proceed and that the problems with that agreement from our perspective will be worked out.\u201d Trump said on Saturday he would discuss KORUS\u2019s fate with advisers this week, prompting widespread concern among lawmakers and the business community. The chairmen and senior Democrats on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee said in a statement on Tuesday that North Korea\u2019s sixth and largest nuclear bomb test on Sunday \u201cunderscores the vital importance of the strong alliance between the United States and South Korea.\u201d The statement by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, senior Democrat Richard Neal and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch and senior Democrat Ron Wyden said talks to improve South Korea\u2019s implementation and compliance with the trade agreement were welcome. But it said the agreement itself was central to the U.S.-South Korean alliance. In a separate letter to Trump, Senator Joni Ernest, a Republican from Iowa in the U.S. corn belt, said the South Korean market was especially important for U.S. beef, corn and pork producers. \u201cTerminating KORUS would leave our farmers at a competitive disadvantage to those in other countries that enjoy preferential trade access to Korea,\u201d Ernst wrote. In a strongly worded statement the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than 3 million businesses, also opposed any \u201crash and irresponsible\u201d withdrawal. \u201cWe do not believe this move would create a single American job \u2014 but it would cost many,\u201d said Tom Donohue, who warned that it would damage relations between the White House and business community. \u201cIronically, states across mid-America that voted for the president would take the hit from withdrawal as their agricultural and manufactured goods exports fell in the wake of such a move,\u201d Donohue said.

Xi, who is preparing for a major Communist Party leadership conference later this month, has made an anti-graft campaign targeting  tigers and flies , both high and low ranking officials, a core policy priority during his five-year term.

In August the head of the anti-graft committee for China s Ministry of Finance was himself put under investigation for suspected graft. In September a senior military officer who sits on China s powerful Central Military Commission, overseen by Xi, was detained and questioned over corruption-related offenses, Reuters reported.

        "text": "DURHAM, N.H. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton shared a stage with former rival Senator Bernie Sanders on Wednesday to appeal for youth votes in the Nov. 8 election as opinion polls show a close race with Republican Donald Trump. Clinton told an audience at the University of New Hampshire that she would make college affordable if she wins the White House, the kind of promise that won Sanders many young supporters during the Democratic nominating contest.       \u201cWe should and we will make public colleges tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year,\u201d Clinton said. She vowed to help those who already have student debt to refinance. Clinton\u2019s campaign is worried that some polls show voters under the age of 30 might not turn out in great numbers at polling stations in November, potentially giving an advantage to Trump. Members of the crowd on Wednesday waved signs that read: \u201cI will vote.\u201d Recent opinion polls have shown the race tightening between Clinton, a former secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, and Trump, a New York real estate magnate.  A majority of Americans say Clinton won Monday night\u2019s presidential debate, but her performance does not appear to have boosted support among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released on Wednesday. The online poll found that 56 percent of American adults felt Clinton did a better job, compared with 26 percent who believed the Republican did better. Even so, Clinton\u2019s performance seemed to have little impact on her support. The poll showed 42 percent supported her, while 38 percent backed Trump.  Trump, often described as racist by Clinton, tried to turn the tables at a rally in Waukesha, Wisconsin. He pointed to the Democrat\u2019s remark that \u201cimplicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just the police,\u201d when asked at the debate whether she believed police are implicitly biased against black people. \u201cShe accuses the entire country, including all of law enforcement, of \u2018implicit bias,\u2019 essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced,\u201d Trump said. Clinton\u2019s event with Sanders took place on a university campus, but it was not open to students without an invitation, according to attendees, many of whom were middle-aged and said they were members of local Democratic organizations or invited by the campaign. Clinton praised Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who was her opponent in the hard-fought struggle for the Democratic nomination earlier this year. \u201cHe is one of the most passionate champions for equality and justice that I have ever seen and someone that I am looking forward to working with,\u201d Clinton said of Sanders, who introduced her on Wednesday. Although Sanders lost to Clinton, he consistently drew younger voters to his side with promises to take on Wall Street, make college less expensive and close the income gap. He called on young people in New Hampshire, a swing state in the presidential election, to get behind Clinton. \u201cGet your uncles, your aunts, get your friends to vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. Clinton\u2019s campaign said it hoped to get Sanders to make more appearances on Clinton\u2019s behalf before the election.  ",

        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has this year registered its highest murder total since modern records began, according to official data, dealing a fresh blow to President Enrique Pena Nieto s pledge to get gang violence under control with presidential elections due in 2018. A total of 23,101 murder investigations were opened in the first 11 months of this year, surpassing the 22,409 registered in the whole of 2011, figures published on Friday night by the interior ministry showed. The figures go back to 1997. Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 pledging to tame the violence that escalated under his predecessor Felipe Calderon. He managed to reduce the murder tally during the first two years of his term, but since then it has risen steadily. At 18.7 per 100,000 inhabitants, the 2017 Mexican murder rate is still lower than it was in 2011, when it reached almost 19.4 per 100,000, the data showed. The rate has also held below levels reported in several other Latin American countries. According to U.N. figures used in the World Bank s online database, Brazil and Colombia both had a murder rate of 27 per 100,000, Venezuela 57, Honduras 64 and El Salvador 109 in 2015, the last year for which data are available. The U.S. rate was 5 per 100,000. Still, Pena Nieto s failure to contain the killings has damaged his credibility and hurt his centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which faces an uphill struggle to hold onto power in the July 2018 presidential election. The law bars Pena Nieto from running again. The current front-runner in the race, leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has floated exploring an amnesty with criminal gangs to reduce the violence, without fleshing out the idea. Mexican newspaper Reforma said on Saturday that after a campaign stop in the central state of Hidalgo on Friday, Lopez Obrador again addressed the issue when asked whether talks aimed at stopping the violence could include criminal gangs.  There can be dialogue with everyone. There needs to be dialogue and there needs to be a push to end the war and guarantee peace. Things can t go on as before,  Reforma quoted Lopez Obrador as saying. Such a strategy harbors risks for the former Mexico City mayor. A poll this month showed that two-thirds of Mexicans reject offering an amnesty to members of criminal gangs in a bid to curb violence, with less than a quarter in favor. Separately, Lopez Obrador said on Saturday he would get rid of Mexico s intelligence agency CISEN if he won the July election, calling it an  unnecessary expense.   We re not going to monitor anybody, we re not going to spy, we re not going to listen to phone calls, or hack phones to get files and photos,  he said in the central town of Tezontepec. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. lawmaker who was President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for drug czar withdrew on Tuesday after a report he spearheaded a bill that hurt the government\u2019s ability to crack down on opioid makers flooding the market with the addictive painkillers. Trump had pegged Representative Tom Marino, a Republican from Pennsylvania, to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy, as the administration faces an epidemic of opioid overdoses that is killing tens of thousands of Americans annually. The position required Senate confirmation. Trump wrote on Twitter: \u201cRep. Tom Marino has informed me that he is withdrawing his name from consideration as drug czar. Tom is a fine man and a great Congressman!\u201d Marino worked as a federal prosecutor under Republican former President George W. Bush, was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 and served on Trump\u2019s transition team after the Republican president was elected last November. Marino said in a statement he had decided to \u201cremove the distraction my nomination has created to the utterly vital mission of this premier agency.\u201d He defended his role in helping pass the bill that was criticized for weakening attempts to rein in opioid use. He said the legislation would help create \u201ca balanced solution for ensuring those who genuinely needed access to certain medications were able to do so, while also empowering the Drug Enforcement Agency  to enforce the law and prevent the sale and abuse of prescription drugs.\u201d Marino said he had been the target of \u201cunfair reporting\u201d and false allegations by a former DEA employee, who he did not name. The Washington Post and the CBS program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d published an investigation on Sunday that showed Marino had worked to weaken federal efforts to slow the flow of opioid drugs. The legislation championed by Marino, which was passed by Congress and signed into law last year by Democratic President Barack Obama, was the product of a drug industry quest to weaken the DEA\u2019s authority to stem the flow of painkillers to the black market, according to the report. The law made it almost impossible for the DEA to freeze suspicious narcotics shipments, according to government documents cited by the Post. Trump has been criticized for his response to the opioid epidemic. He has yet to declare it a national emergency as he pledged to do on Aug. 10 following a recommendation by a presidential commission.  Asked about that at a news conference on Monday, Trump said he would make the declaration next week. Such a move would boost funding for various forms of treatment and give the government more flexibility in taking steps to expedite action. Nine months into his presidency, Trump has not named a chief for the Drug Enforcement Administration, currently headed by an acting administrator. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were responsible for more than 33,000 U.S. deaths in 2015, the latest year for which data is available. Estimates show the death rate has continued rising. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called Marino\u2019s withdrawal \u201cthe right decision,\u201d but added that \u201cthe fact that he was nominated in the first place is further evidence that when it comes to the opioid crisis, the Trump administration talks the talk, but refuses to walk the walk.\u201d  No. 2 U.S. Justice Department official Rod Rosenstein, asked about the Marino-backed law during a news conference announcing indictments against accused Chinese fentanyl traffickers, said the Trump administration would review the law.  Rosenstein said he was \u201cnot prepared to answer\u201d whether the administration would ask Congress to repeal it. \u201cWe are going to look into these issues ... about what tools DEA has available to it. And if we conclude they don\u2019t have the appropriate tools, then we will seek more tools,\u201d Rosenstein said. The Justice Department announced the indictments of two major Chinese drug traffickers on charges of illegally making and selling fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid painkiller, over the internet to Americans. The department said it charged Xiaobing Yan, 40, and Jian Zhang, 38, with conspiring to distribute large quantities of fentanyl and chemically similar drugs. It said Zhang\u2019s actions led to four deaths. Trump\u2019s opioid commission, headed by Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, cited government data showing that since 1999 U.S. opioid overdoses have quadrupled, adding that nearly two-thirds of U.S. drug overdoses were linked to opioids such as heroin and the powerful painkillers Percocet, OxyContin and fentanyl.

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States, Britain and other countries opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will not support the reconstruction of the country until there is a political transition  away from Assad,  British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Monday. The  Friends of Syria  group, an alliance of mainly Western and Gulf Arab countries, met in New York on Monday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly at a time when the conflict in Syria, now in its seventh year, appears to be less urgent with attention focused on the North Korean nuclear threat and the fate of the Iran nuclear deal.  We believe that the only way forward is to get a political process going and to make it clear to the Iranians, Russians and Assad regime that we, the like-minded group, will not support the reconstruction of Syria until there is such a political process and that means, as Resolution 2254 says, to a transition away from Assad,  Johnson said. He was speaking after a meeting of about 14 countries that back the Syrian opposition including France, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United States.  The U.N. Security Council has adopted a Syria transition road map through a Geneva-led process. Russia joined the war on Assad s behalf in 2015, turning the momentum in his favor. Assad also enjoys robust support from Iran and Lebanon s Hezbollah. Meanwhile, the moderate Syrian opposition is moribund and the United States has largely stepped back from a leading role in Syrian diplomacy. Earlier this year the Trump administration also halted the CIA s covert program to equip and train certain rebel groups fighting Assad. Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, David Satterfield, said all those at the meeting agreed that  there has got to be a political process if there is to be any international participation in the reconstruction of Syria.   The regime and the regime supporters cannot declare a victory solely based on a map and colors of positions on the ground,  Satterfield said.  The reconstruction of Syria depends very much on that credible political process. That political process is focused on Geneva and the role of the United Nations.  The meeting on Monday was in stark contrast to last year s which took place after a ceasefire deal between the United States and Russia effectively collapsed when an aid convoy was bombed in Aleppo, Syria s largest city. Aleppo is now in the hands of Assad s forces and Assad himself is in a much stronger position, thanks to Russian and Iranian support. The last major international attempt to resolve the crisis ended in failure when the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), which included Iran, was cast aside after Syrian government forces retook the rebel stronghold of Aleppo in 2016. Russia, Turkey and Iran have been negotiating separately for months in Astana to try to reduce the violence on the ground by creating de-escalation zones across the country, although those talks do not cover a long-term political solution  We discussed here how to bring it back to the U.N.-led process and Geneva,  Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr m told Reuters. Asked if there was consensus on that, she said  I would say so.    It s good if the Astana process leads to de-escalation and a reduction of the violence but it has to lead into the political process.  Earlier on Monday, France warned that the status quo in Syria risked leading to the country s permanent fragmentation and opening the door to new radical Islamist groups. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters in New York he would hold a meeting with the four other permanent members of the Security Council - Britain, China, Russia and the United States - on Thursday to persuade them to create a contact group to give new impetus to end the seven-year conflict. Le Drian said  realism  dictated that Assad could not stay in power after millions of Syrians had fled the country due to the war, but that it was vital major powers worked together to help revive U.N.-brokered peace talks in Geneva. Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said the French contact group proposal was not discussed at the Friends of Syria meeting.  But Riyad Hijab, a prominent Syrian opposition leader, said he told French President Emmanuel Macron that the initiative was important in part because  of American withdrawal and Russia is dominating the entire process. So Mr. Macron s initiative  is the right way to fix this because it s vital all five (permanent Security Council members) are involved in the process.  ",

        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday it was worried that proposed new U.S. sanctions against Moscow could hurt major investment projects with European partners, but said it was premature to say if and how it would retaliate. The White House said on Sunday that U.S. President Donald Trump was open to signing legislation toughening sanctions on Russia after Senate and House leaders reached agreement on a bill late last week. That has raised concerns in Germany which has already threatened to retaliate against the United States if the new sanctions end up penalising German firms, such as those involved with building Nord Stream 2, a project to build a pipeline carrying Russian gas across the Baltic. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call Moscow was worried that U.S. sanctions could hit third countries, as well as Russia, hard. \u201cWe are working with our European partners on implementing a number of large-scale projects,\u201d said Peskov, when asked about the possible impact of the new U.S. sanctions on projects like  Nord Stream 2. \u201cIt goes without saying that we and our European partners attach great importance to finishing these projects and we will work towards this,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why discussions about \u2018sanctions themes\u2019 \u2014 which could potentially obstruct these projects \u2014 are a cause of concern for us.\u201d Peskov said the Kremlin took \u201can extremely negative view\u201d of the proposed new sanctions, calling the rhetoric surrounding them counter-productive and damaging to U.S.-Russia ties. But he said Moscow was for now ready to wait and see what the final shape of the sanctions might be. \u201cAs for the Washington administration\u2019s stance on sanctions, we have seen some corrections to it,\u201d said Peskov. \u201cWe will wait patiently ... until this position has been formulated unambiguously.\u201d Separately, Peskov declined to comment on reports that the European Union might discuss new sanctions against Moscow over its delivery of Siemens turbines to sanctioned Crimea. Reuters on Monday quoted two diplomatic sources in Brussels as saying that Germany was urging the European Union to add up to four more Russian nationals and companies to the bloc\u2019s sanctions blacklist over Siemens gas turbines delivered to Moscow-annexed Crimea.

        "title": "With tears and song, China welcomes Xi as great, wise leader",
        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese officials on Thursday heaped praise on President Xi Jinping s political ideology, unveiled a day earlier at a key Communist Party Congress, a sign that it could be enshrined in the party s constitution and further cement his power. Some ruling Communist Party officials were moved on Thursday to song, dance and tears in adulation of Xi, a day after he opened the twice-a-decade conclave pledging to build a prosperous  modern socialist country  for a  new era .  Three outgoing members of the elite seven-man Politburo Standing Committee that Xi heads lauded  Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era , according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Such statements indicate that Xi could cement his power with his new eponymous slogan being incorporated into the party s constitution. Whether the theory is included bearing his name will be a key measure of his status, analysts have said. No other leader has had an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office since Mao Zedong, the founder of modern China.  Xi is poised to begin a second five-year term next week. Party officials hailed Xi as a wise and great  lingxiu , or leader, a reverent honorific bestowed on only two others: Mao and his short-lived successor Hua Guofeng - another sign that Xi has accumulated more power than his immediate predecessors and could revive a party chairmanship as a precursor to staying on in some capacity beyond the end of his second term in 2022.  Xi Jinping... has obtained the heartfelt love and respect of the entire party, army and people, he deserves to be called wise leader,  Beijing party secretary Cai Qi, a Xi ally and one-time colleague, said on Wednesday at a meeting of the city delegation, according to the official Beijing Daily. Officials lavishing praise on the party s top leader at a congress is not unusual, but overt displays of emotion or personal adulation are rare. One female delegate from the southern province of Jiangxi broke into song to praise Xi s treatment of ethnic minorities, while another from Guangdong province said that, listening to Xi s speech, her eyes had brimmed with tears.  I feel that the reason for my country s accomplishments is fundamentally the helmsmanship of Xi Jinping,  said Jing Junhai, Beijing s deputy party chief, invoking a phase often used to describe Mao. The 64-year-old Xi has consolidated power swiftly since assuming the party leadership in 2012, locking up rivals for corruption, tightening controls on civil society, revamping the military and asserting China s rising might on the global stage. Some party officials painted Xi as a saviour.  Because of the Party Central Committee with comrade Xi Jinping as its core, in five years, the party has been saved, the army has been saved, the country has been saved,  Liu Shiyu, head of China s securities regulator, said on Thursday. Others were more restrained. Hu Chunhua, party chief in Guangdong province and a potential contender for a spot on the new Politburo Standing Committee to be revealed next week, simply referred to Xi as general secretary and did not mention his theory during an open session on Thursday, in contrast with more than a dozen other delegates who spoke. State media reported that he had praised Xi s theory the day before. For an interactive graphic on China s economic report card, click tmsnrt.rs/2kT7Xuv The exact meaning of Xi s new banner term is not yet clear, although it is not unusual for Communist Party leaders to announce lofty slogans and then fill in the details as they go. An ideology named after Xi to guide China and the party would further consolidate his power, said Ryan Manuel, a Chinese politics expert at the University of Hong Kong.  This is a good umbrella for him to just keep saying whatever he wants and the system having to respond and study it,  he said. Xi s immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have had their ideological concepts enshrined in the constitution, but not their names. The party gave Xi the title of  core  leader a year ago, a strengthening of his position ahead of the congress, adding to speculation that Xi could retain power beyond a customary second term and even revive Mao s chairman title.

        "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkey s Tayyip Erdogan spoke on Saturday and agreed to continue to work toward stronger ties and regional security, Erdogan s office said, a day after he lashed out at U.S. authorities for indicting one of his ex-ministers. Ties between the United States and its NATO ally have been strained by Washington s support for the YPG Kurdish fighters in the battle against Islamic State in Syria. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group. Ankara has also been frustrated by what it sees as Washington s reluctance to extradite the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkey blames Gulen, who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999, for last year s failed coup.  Noting the strategic partnership between Turkey and the United States, the two leaders emphasized the importance of continuing to work together to further strengthen bilateral relations and increase stability in the region,  the Turkish Presidency said in a statement. The two leaders agreed to meet in New York at the United States General Assembly, scheduled for this month. The call was notable for its timing, coming a day after Erdogan described a U.S. prosecutor s indictment against Turkey s former economy minister as being politically motivated and tantamount to an attack on Ankara. The former minister, Zafer Caglayan, and the ex-head of a state-owned Turkish bank were charged this week with conspiring to violate Iran sanctions by illegally moving hundreds of millions of dollars through the U.S. financial system on Tehran s behalf. The indictment marked the first time an ex-government member with close ties to Erdogan had been charged in the on-going U.S. investigation, which has strained ties between the two countries.  For the moment, it is impossible to evaluate this within legal logic,  he told reporters on Friday.  I see this step against our former economy minister as a step against the Turkish Republic. He had also called on Washington to re-think the charges.  I hope we ll get a chance to discuss this issue in the United States. You may be a big nation, but being a just nation is something else. Being a just nation requires the legal system to work fairly.   ",

        "title": "Native Americans move to frontlines in battle over voting rights",
        "text": "BELCOURT, North Dakota (Reuters) - Elvis Norquay, a member of the Chippewa Indian tribe, has lived most of his 58 years on North Dakota\u2019s remote Turtle Mountain reservation and says he\u2019s never had a problem voting. That was before 2014, when he hitched a ride with a friend to cast a ballot in local and congressional elections and was turned away. Embarrassed, he asked why he couldn\u2019t vote. He was told he lacked proper ID under new state requirements. He has no phone, no current driver\u2019s license and his tribal ID lacks a street address. \u201cWhen we left, my friend said, \u2018that\u2019s not right\u2019,\u201d said Norquay, who has lived on disability since 2002 in a rural county near the Canadian border. Norquay is among a growing number of Native Americans embroiled in court battles over changes to voting laws that could influence the outcome of some tight races in the November 2016 presidential and congressional elections. While the Native American population is small nationally, lawsuits involving tribes over voting problems have proliferated since the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, a signature legislative achievement of the 1960s civil rights movement. North Dakota is one of 17 states that have new voting restrictions in place since the last presidential contest, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. Many of these changes have sparked lawsuits and accusations that black, Hispanic and other minority voters could be disenfranchised. Five federal lawsuits involving Native Americans have been filed since the Supreme Court decision, including three this year alone. Suits in North Dakota, Utah, South Dakota and Arizona claim new voting rules passed in majority Republican states are discriminatory and could reduce voting by tribal members, who tend to back Democrats. A suit in Alaska, for example, claimed the state violated federal rules by failing to translate voting materials for tribal voters. The tribes say changes to voting rules in those states disproportionately affect Native Americans, an allegation the states and counties deny. The Native American vote is not big enough to flip a safe Republican state such as North Dakota into the Democrat column in this year\u2019s presidential election, but Native Americans are a growing proportion of the population and a majority in some counties where increased voter turnout in recent years has tipped the balance in some congressional races. In many states, the number of Native Americans is growing faster than the population as a whole. Between 2000 and 2010, the Native American population rose by 26.7 percent to 1.1 million, compared to 9.7 percent growth in America\u2019s overall population, census data showed. Recent changes to voting laws, such as North Dakota\u2019s new voter ID law, are part of \u201ca much broader, deliberate, and concerted effort by Republicans to reduce turnout among particular groups of voters on election day,\u201d said Pratt Wiley, head of voter protection issues at the Democratic Party in Washington. \u201cThose voters are more vulnerable today than they were before the Supreme Court invalidated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013,\u201d he said of Native Americans. Republicans deny that voting law changes passed by Republican-dominated legislatures are discriminatory and say they are intended to reduce fraudulent votes. \u201cThese are popular common sense laws to protect elections from fraud,\u201d said Lindsay Walters, national spokeswoman at the Republican National Committee. At issue in North Dakota are revisions pushed largely by Republican state legislators in 2013 and 2015 to a 2003 state elections law that eliminated a provision that had allowed people without proper identification such as Norquay to vote if they were recognized by a poll worker or if they signed an affidavit swearing to their identity. Norquay and six other members of his tribe sued the secretary of state in January in U.S. District Court in North Dakota. They said they were refused the right to vote in November 2014 because many old tribal IDs such as Norquay\u2019s don\u2019t list a current residential address.  It says some tribal members can\u2019t afford a new tribal ID or struggle to obtain proper identification because there are no state offices that provide driver\u2019s licenses on the reservations.  Richard McCloud, chairman of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, said widespread unemployment and poverty among tribal members meant that some struggle to afford the $10 needed to obtain a new tribal card.  \u201cTen dollars is three pounds of hamburger and some macaroni for a family,\u201d said McCloud at the tribe\u2019s headquarters on the reservation of about 4,274 people a few miles (km) south of the Canadian border. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s no big deal if you work, but it\u2019s a big deal to people that don\u2019t have access to $10,\u201d he said. North Dakota\u2019s secretary of state, Al Jaeger, the only defendant in the suit, said in an interview that the law is not discriminatory and simplifies the voting process in the only state in the country that does not require voters to register ahead of an election. He said his office has spent heavily on ad campaigns to educate voters about what IDs are accepted. Jaeger\u2019s deputy, Jim Silrum, said the ID requirements are not a barrier for the 97 percent of state residents with driver\u2019s licenses, an accepted form of ID, so the number of people affected by the changes is miniscule. Those with no driver\u2019s license, can get a non-driver state ID allowed at the polls from the motor vehicle department for free. Jaeger and Silrum said they could not respond directly to an assertion in the lawsuit that residents on reservations have to travel long distances to obtain a state ID. Republican state Representative Jim Kasper from Fargo repeated his party\u2019s argument that the changes were aimed at reducing the risk of voter fraud, but Silrum said there was little evidence of such irregularities. In the 2012 presidential election, there were only nine cases of people voting twice, but that was because they used the same ID rather than a lack of proper identification, he said. State Representative Kylie Oversen, a Democrat from Grand Forks, said the changes could alter tight elections in favor of Republicans. She said Republicans pushed for the bill after Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012 by less than 3,000 votes. In sparsely populated states such as North Dakota, with just 739,000 people, congressional elections have been decided by just a few thousand votes. Rolette County, surrounding Norquay\u2019s reservation, is one of two counties in the state where about 75 percent of the population is Native American. Those two counties were the only places in North Dakota that gave President Barack Obama more than 70 percent of the vote in 2012. After the changes in the ID law were implemented in North Dakota, voter turnout in Rolette County dropped by more than 12 percentage points between the 2010 and 2014 mid-term elections, more than any other county in the state, election data from the secretary of state\u2019s office shows. \u201cWhat has happened is the Native American vote has become something that can tip elections,\u201d said Jean Schroedel, a professor at Claremont Graduate University in California who studies Native American voting. The Native American Rights Fund, a non-profit law firm representing Norquay and other members of his tribe in the lawsuit against the state, plans to file a motion by June 30 requesting that the court invalidate the changes to the ID law ahead of November\u2019s election, according to court documents.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. Senate Republican warned his party on Thursday against simultaneously overhauling Medicare and the Obamacare health insurance program, saying this would be \u201cbiting off more than you can chew.\u201d The cautionary comments from Senator Lamar Alexander came after House Speaker Paul Ryan, long an advocate of privatize  Medicare, said Republican lawmakers would be discussing reforms of the health insurance program for the elderly with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Republicans won the White House as well as keeping their majorities in both houses of Congress in elections last month, and are now busy preparing an agenda for next year after the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3 and Trump takes office Jan. 20. \u201cWell, of course it\u2019s up to the speaker and Senator (Mitch) McConnell (the majority leader) what our agenda is, but my advice to them would be, save Medicare for another day,\u201d Alexander, chairman of the Senate\u2019s health, education, labor and pensions committee, told reporters in a Capitol hallway. Medicare serves more than 50 million Americans who are elderly or disabled. More than one-third of them are in Medicare Advantage plans run by private insurers like UnitedHealth Group Inc. The balance receive medical benefits directly from Medicare on a traditional fee-for-service basis. The government has been trying to cut spending on the program, which rises each year with the cost of medical services and drugs.  \u201cWe want to begin immediately to repeal Obamacare,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cTrying to deal with the solvency issues in Medicare at the same time falls into the category of biting off more than you can chew ... a little humility here would be in order, we can\u2019t do everything at once and we shouldn\u2019t try.\u201d Ryan earlier Thursday said that Medicare was on a path to going bankrupt around 2028, and needed reform, a repeat of his long-standing stance. He wants to convert the fee-for-service program into a system of subsidies for seniors, to buy coverage from private insurers or a scaled-back Medicare. Democrats including Senator Chuck Schumer have seized on the fact that Trump\u2019s nominee to head the Health and Human Services department - Representative Tom Price - supports major changes to Medicare, to warn Republicans against privatizing the program.  Alexander also said that while Republicans will move quickly to repeal Obamacare, the repeal probably would not take effect for two or three years, during which time lawmakers can work on a replacement plan.

        "text": "SAN JUAN (Reuters) - As struggling Puerto Rico enters a bitter election season, discord in the U.S. territory\u2019s ruling party is reaching new heights, which could benefit bondholders. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla has pushed to force hedge funds, mutual funds and other investors to take losses on the $70 billion Puerto Rico owes them because it cannot repay the debt in full. He says the island's staggering poverty and lack of money to ensure basic services constitutes a humanitarian crisis. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/1PjZvh5) Garcia Padilla, deeply unpopular with exhausted political capital, has dwindling allies among campaigning lawmakers now distancing themselves from him. They may adopt more creditor-friendly policies to counter his populist ideals, experts say.\u00a0 Puerto Rican residents vote in local primaries this Sunday with some members of Garcia Padilla\u2019s Popular Democratic Party locked in tight battles, including Rep. Rafael \u201cTatito\u201d Hernandez, who runs Puerto Rico\u2019s House finance committee. The island\u2019s election cycle is unique, with all posts decided on the same day every four years, making political campaigns especially heated. Election day, Nov. 8, is a holiday, and voter turnout averages more than 80 percent. The governor will not seek a second term, and financial markets have never given him much credibility. His administration has yet to publish fiscal 2014\u2019s audited financial results. That has fed a perception of irresponsible government, and spurred PDP members to try to distance themselves from his administration. The dynamic could play into the hands of creditors. Garcia Padilla set aside about $200 million in the fiscal 2017 budget toward the $800 million payment due on GO debt July 1, but Hernandez has said he will lobby to earmark enough to pay it all. \u201cThere is a lot of lobbying here by bondholders, and one of the big issues is whether to include money to pay that debt in next year\u2019s budget,\u201d Sergio Marxuach, a San Juan-based economist, said in an interview. A law signed in April, giving the governor authority to issue moratoriums on debt payments, could be scaled back, said Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson, who follows Puerto Rico. \u201cOur base case has been that the budget will be used as leverage to amend back parts of the moratorium,\u201d Hanson said.  While these local fights play out, the U.S. Congress has been debating a bill that would pull Puerto Rico\u2019s finances under federal oversight and allow the government to restructure its bond debt. The governor, though never wildly popular, has had some success pushing his agenda. But lately the wheels have come off, even though his party has controlled the House and Senate since 2013.\u00a0 Key party leaders, like Hernandez and former Secretary of State David Bernier, the PDP\u2019s gubernatorial candidate, have openly criticized him. Garcia Padilla\u2019s own economy minister, Alberto Baco Bague, publicly questioned the legitimacy of the humanitarian crisis, telling local media in May the narrative was a political \u201cstrategy.\u201d Baco declined to comment for this story. Last week, in a boon for businesses, the legislature repealed a new round of tax hikes on professional services, the same bill it had approved just last year on the strength of Garcia Padilla\u2019s message of financial desperation. Adding to the chaos, a group of Puerto Rico creditors sued Garcia Padilla\u2019s administration over the legality of the debt moratorium, despite having signed an agreement barring lawsuits while sides negotiated a restructuring. The move reflected ever-growing acrimony between the government and its creditors, Hanson said. A spokeswoman for Garcia Padilla\u2019s office had no immediate comment. Like Baco\u2019s criticism, much of the internal discord turns on whether there is actually a humanitarian crisis. But while that argument may be losing political steam, it should not be disregarded, Marxuach said. The message has resonated with Democrats in Washington, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Rep. Raul Grijalva, who made separate visits to Puerto Rico in May to stress the dire human circumstances on the island.  \u201cPuerto Rico is at a moment of necessity and crisis,\u201d Lew said May 9 in San Juan.\u00a0 Marxuach said the crisis is not so much a ticking time bomb, \u201cit\u2019s a slow burn.\u201d\u00a0 Public pensions covering 330,000 beneficiaries are the worst-funded of any state-level U.S. pension this century, set to run out of cash in three years.  Hospitals face staffing shortfalls as doctors flee to better-paying jobs on the mainland. The island\u2019s poverty rate is at 45 percent; unemployment is near 12 percent, and higher in rural towns.\u00a0 Puerto Ricans\u2019 ability to emigrate to the mainland is an escape hatch that mitigates the economic stress and political pressure to fix it.\u00a0 But for those without the ability to escape the burdens just grow. \u201cThe debt stays the same,\u201d said Marxuach, \u201cbut the economy grows even less.\u201d ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A political feud erupted on Wednesday over the U.S. House Intelligence Committee\u2019s probe of suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, with charges that the panel\u2019s Republican chairman subpoenaed the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency without telling Democratic members. Committee aides complained that the chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, who publicly recused himself from leading the Russia probe in April following a secret visit he paid to White House officials, failed to consult Democrats on the subpoenas. The subpoenas asked the agencies to provide details of any requests made by two top Obama administration aides and the former CIA director to \u201cunmask\u201d names of Trump campaign advisers inadvertently picked up in top-secret foreign communications intercepts, congressional sources said. The former officials named in the subpoenas were Obama national security adviser Susan Rice, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power and former CIA Director John Brennan. \u201cSubpoenas related to the \u2018unmasking\u2019 issue would have been sent by Chairman Nunes acting separately from the committee\u2019s Russia investigation. This action would have been taken without the minority\u2019s (Democrats\u2019) agreement,\u201d said a senior committee aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. Another congressional source, who also requested anonymity, said Democrats were \u201cinformed and consulted\u201d before the subpoenas were issued. The CIA declined to comment on the subpoenas and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and NSA did not immediate respond to requests for comment. U.S. privacy laws and intelligence regulations require that Americans\u2019 names picked up in foreign communications intercepts be concealed unless senior officials request them to be disclosed for intelligence or law enforcement purposes. Any such requests undergo rigorous legal reviews. Several U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that all such requests by Obama administration officials were properly scrutinized and appropriate. SUBPOENAS FOR TRUMP LAWYER, EX-AIDE The spy agency subpoenas were not mentioned in a bipartisan announcement on Wednesday that the panel approved subpoenas for President Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in connection with the Russia probe. The committee also approved subpoenas to the two men\u2019s firms, Flynn Intel Llc, and Michael D. Cohen and Associates PC, the committee statement said. \u201cAs part of our ongoing investigation into Russian active measures during the 2016 campaign, today we approved subpoenas for several individuals for testimony, personal documents and business records,\u201d Republican Representative Mike Conaway and Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, who are leading the committee probe, said in a joint statement. Conaway assumed Republican leadership of the probe after Nunes recused himself. Nunes retained his power to issue subpoenas. U.S. intelligence agencies reported in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw a campaign of computer hacking, fake news and propaganda intended to swing the election to Republican Trump over his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Putin has denied conducting such a campaign. Trump denies any collusion between Russia and his campaign and has questioned the veracity of the U.S. intelligence finding. Trump fired Flynn in February for failing to disclose the content of his talks with Sergei Kislyak, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, and misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. The retired Army general is the subject of congressional, Justice Department and Defense Department investigations into his apparent failure to disclose payments he received from Russian and Turkish entities. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an FBI examination of possible contacts between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia, according to the New York Times. It reported that Cohen was involved in a back-channel plan, which never came to fruition, that would have involved a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, and the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Moscow. CNN reported on Wednesday night that congressional investigators were looking into whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions had an undisclosed private meeting with Kislyak during the campaign, citing Republican and Democratic sources in Congress and intelligence officials briefed on the probe. The focus of the probe is on whether such a meeting took place on April 27, 2016, at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington,  where Trump delivered his first major foreign policy address, CNN reported.  During his confirmation hearing in January, Sessions testified that he \u201cdid not have any communications with the Russians\u201d during the campaign and said in a written statement given to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was not in contact with anyone linked to the Russian government during the campaign. It was reported in March that he met with Kislyak twice during the campaign, once at the Republican National Convention in July and once in his Senate office in September. Sessions later admitted having the meetings but said they were part of his Senate duties and were unrelated to the campaign. He later recused himself from the Russia probe. ",

        "title": "Factbox: How the U.S. Senate and House tax proposals differ",
        "text": "(Reuters) - A tax plan by U.S. Senate Republicans released on Thursday diverges in several ways from legislation being pushed by Republicans in the House of Representatives, complicating Republican efforts to fulfill their goal of overhauling the tax code by the end of the year. Here are the major provisions that differ significantly. CORPORATE RATE: The House plan would immediately cut the  corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. The Senate would set the same rate, but delay it by one year. CARRIED INTEREST: The Senate leaves unchanged a loophole that allows private-equity fund managers and other wealthy Wall Street financiers to pay the capital gains tax rate instead of the higher income tax rate on their \u201ccarried interest\u201d income. The House version narrows the loophole by requiring investments to be held for more than three years instead of one year currently in order to qualify for capital gains treatment. NET OPERATING LOSSES: The Senate version eliminates the carry-back and carry-forward tax strategies by businesses to reduce past and future tax liabilities using net operating losses. The House version tightens the rules around their use. PASS-THROUGHS: The House caps the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non-corporate enterprises at 25 percent, down from the current top rate on \u201cpass-through\u201d income of up to 39.6 percent. The Senate version has no special pass-through rate but allows business owners to deduct about 17.4 percent of business income from individual taxes. That translates to a 30 percent tax rate for high-income filers. REPATRIATION OF OVERSEAS EARNINGS: The Senate imposes a tax of 12 percent for liquid assets and 5 percent for illiquid. The House sets the rates at 14 percent and 7 percent, respectively. TAX BRACKETS: The Senate version maintains seven tax brackets, with the top bracket\u2019s rate at 38.5 percent. The House has four brackets with the top one unchanged from current levels at 39.6 percent and lifts qualifying income on that top rate to more than $1 million. MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION: The House caps the deduction of interest payments on mortgages of up to $500,000, and only on a primary residence. The Senate version keeps the existing limit at $1 million but eliminates the deduction of interest on home-equity loans.   DEDUCTING STATE AND LOCAL TAXES: The Senate bill repeals the state and local tax deduction entirely. The House version repeals the deduction for state and local income and sales tax and caps the deduction for state and local property tax paid at $10,000.  STANDARD DEDUCTION: The two versions are in line with each other, with a standard deduction of $12,200 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples, nearly double the current  levels. CHILD TAX CREDIT: The Senate would expand the child tax credit to $1,650 from $1,000. The House version sets it at  $1,600.  INHERITANCES: While the House wants to double the exemption on inherited assets and repeal the tax over a period of six years, the Senate only wants to double the exemption.  ",

        "title": "Slovenian government faces test in pre-election investment referendum",
        "text": "LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenians vote in a referendum on Sunday on whether the government should pursue construction of a 1-billion-euro ($1.20 billion) railway to its main Adriatic port - a test of the government s popularity ahead of elections next year. Given the opposition s lead in opinion polls and criticism of the project as too expensive, analysts see possible changes in the center-left coalition government ahead of the elections in June or July 2018 if the railway gets a thumbs-down in the referendum.  If (it) is rejected that would be a strong blow to the government, particularly the leading party SMC (Party of the Modern Centre),  Meta Roglic, political analyst at the daily Dnevnik, told Reuters. Opinion polls have forecast varying outcomes of the referendum but suggest turnout might not be sufficient to block the railway project. A poll published by daily Delo said voters would narrowly reject the project, while another released by Dnevnik said voters would back it by a 53-29 percent margin. Under Slovenian law, a minimum 20 percent of some 1.7 million eligible voters would be needed to sink the project, in addition to a majority of those voting. Civil society group Taxpayers Don t Give Up and the leading opposition group, the center-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), pushed for the referendum, saying the railway line as projected by the government is too costly. The government says the 27-km (17-mile) rail link between Koper and the town of Divaca is necessary to speed up freight traffic to and from Slovenia s only port and improve the port s competitiveness. The government has received 44.3 million euros in EU funding for preparation of the track while neighboring Hungary said it is willing to invest about 200 million euros as it relies on Koper for much of its seaborne freight. The opposition SDS has led in opinion polls for most of the past year. But government parties hope to improve their ratings by advancing the railway project, raising family subsidies and the lowest tier of wages, and injecting more money into the state health sector in the coming months.

        "title": "Border without doctors? South Koreans urge more funding for trauma care after defector drama",
        "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - A defector s treatment for critical injuries suffered during a dramatic dash from North Korea has highlighted a shortage of South Korean trauma doctors and again underscored Seoul s lack of preparedness in the event of hostilities with Pyongyang. The defector, identified only by his family name of Oh, was shot at least four times by his former comrades during his daring escape into South Korea last week. American military helicopters flew the wounded soldier not to one of the many hospitals in Seoul, closer to the border, but to the Ajou University trauma center an hour south of the capital. The center, and its lead surgeon John Cook-Jong Lee, have been thrust into the spotlight amid a push for more trauma facilities and specialist doctors in a country still technically at war and where preventable trauma death rates are already amongst the highest in the OECD.      An official at South Korea s Ministry of Health said more than 30 percent of people who suffered fatal trauma injuries last year could have survived if they had access to proper, timely treatment. That s far higher than the 10 to 15 percent in places such as the United States and Japan.  Although 133 surgeons are currently entitled to perform trauma surgery, I highly doubt that all of them can actually perform,  said Park Chan-yong, general affairs manager of the Korean Society of Traumatology.  Many of them just gained the rights, but never had practiced this kind of surgery.  By Friday, attention sparked by the defector s case had prompted nearly 200,000 South Koreans to join a petition asking the presidential Blue House to boost funding for Lee s trauma center, one of just nine in the country. During increased tensions this year with heavily armed North Korea, Seoul has faced criticism over a lack of preparation for major emergencies, with many bomb shelters, for example, laying forgotten and unstocked with food or water.  The government has launched programs to raise awareness, but public emergency drills often fail to attract much response. Despite the apparent need for specialists, Lee said he has faced  ignorance,  including from some doctors who complained he was showing off with new techniques, since returning from training in the United States in 2003.  I had to explain whenever I met new doctors here, what a trauma surgeon was. Every day,  he said.  Often, trauma medicine is not seen as attractive or lucrative as other fields, said Park.  Residents and medical students avoid coming to traumatology, because there is no hope and no dream.   The South Korean government says it recognizes the problem, and in 2014 set a goal of lowering its rate of preventable trauma fatalities to levels closer to those of other OECD countries by 2020. But with a shortage of funding, only half of a planned 17 regional trauma centers have been built so far, a health ministry official said. Germany, for example, has less than twice the population of South Korea, but 10 times as many operational trauma centers. South Korea s strict gun control laws also mean there are far fewer gunshot wounds like those suffered by the defector.  Between January 2012 and August 2017, 31 people were killed and 51 wounded by guns, according to the police. In comparison, in the United States, where Lee trained, more than 33,000 people die from gunshot wounds every year, according to annual averages of government data. However, the kinds of industrial accidents and car crashes commonly seen in South Korea can cause equally bad injuries, Lee said.  In South Korea, roughly speaking, more than 90 percent of trauma victims are brought to the hospital in less than an hour,  Lee said.  However, frequently, they are put in emergency rooms for a while, sometime for hours, to get proper care.  Lee has made a name for himself and the Ajou trauma center, in part by cultivating a close relationship with the American and South Korean militaries, making it an obvious choice for the defector s treatment. Lee said his fascination with the American medical evacuation crews and the techniques he learned in the United States have led him to push for a series of new additions at the trauma center, including a recently completed roof-top helipad with flashing neon messages in English for American pilots.  U.S. military air crews, however, have yet to obtain Pentagon permission to use the new helipad, Lee said. The arrival of the North Korean defector has brought Lee a new round of criticism for appearing to seek attention,  including from one lawmaker, a charge he says is unfounded. But it has also highlighted the need for more funding for his center and more trauma facilities in South Korea.  To those who get only 10, 20 minutes of sleep while working to save emergency room patients, to those who only get to go home once a week or not even that   we should not be criticizing them but rather, discuss how to resolve problems within the system,  the petition submitted to the Blue House said.

        "text": "ANKARA/SOCHI (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan took swipes at U.S. and Russian interventions in Syria on Monday and said if countries truly believed a military solution was impossible, they should withdraw their troops. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump said in a joint statement on Saturday they would continue to fight against Islamic State in Syria, while agreeing that there was no military solution to the country s wider, six-year-old conflict.  I am having trouble understanding these comments,  Erdogan told reporters before flying to Russia for talks with Putin.  If a military solution is out of the question, then those who say this should pull their troops out.   Then a political method should be sought in Syria, ways to head into elections should be examined... We will discuss these with Putin,  he said. After more than four hours of talks with Putin in the southern Russian resort of Sochi, Erdogan said the two leaders had agreed to focus on a political solution to the conflict.  We agreed that the grounds to focus on a political solution (in Syria) have been formed,  he said. Putin said Russia would continue to work on Syria with Turkey and their efforts were yielding results:  The level of violence has definitely been reduced, favorable conditions are being created for the progression of a inter-Syrian dialogue.  Neither leader went into more specific detail. Asked if the two discussed Erdogan s earlier comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the talks were about more complex issues which could not be made public, according to RIA news agency. Turkey has been annoyed by both Russian and U.S. missions in Syria. Before his trip to Russia, Erdogan said both Moscow, which backs President Bashar al-Assad, and Washington, which armed Syrian YPG Kurdish forces Ankara sees as allied to separatists fighting in southeastern Turkey, had set up bases.  The United States said it would completely leave Iraq, but it didn t. The world is not stupid, some realities are being told differently and practiced differently,  he said. He said the United States had 13 bases in Syria and Russia had five. The YPG has said Washington has established seven military bases in areas of northern Syria. The U.S.-led coalition says it does not discuss the location of its forces. Russia has been a strong supporter of Assad, whose removal Erdogan has demanded, and Moscow s military intervention two years ago helped turn the conflict in the Syrian president s favor.  Turkish troops have also fought in Syria to halt the advance of Kurdish YPG forces along its frontier.  We attach great importance to the joint steps Turkey and Russia will take on (the) defense industry,  Erdogan said. His remarks follow Turkey s recently completed purchase of Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, a defense deal that Turkey s Western allies see as a snub to the NATO alliance. The weapon cannot be integrated into NATO defenses. Ankara says it is making agreements with the Franco-Italian EUROSAM consortium to develop, produce and use its own sources for air defense system.

The White House wrote to Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Dec. 9 informing them of its decision. Feinstein, who released the letter on Monday, said Obama had refused to declassify the report at this time but she was pleased it would go into his archive, meaning it would one day be available for declassification. \u201cThe report represents six years of hard work by dedicated staff, and I firmly believe its 6,700 pages and 38,000 footnotes will stand the test of time. I also strongly believe that this must be a lesson learned \u2014 that torture doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Feinstein said in a statement.  A White House spokesman confirmed the decision. Burr\u2019s office had no immediate comment. Feinstein and other congressional Democrats had urged Obama to declassify and release the report before Republican President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20. Feinstein chaired the intelligence panel as it researched and wrote the report on the interrogation techniques used in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, and she spearheaded the effort to expose the CIA\u2019s actions. The committee, then led by Democrats, released a 525-page executive summary of its findings in December 2014. But the full report has been deemed by Obama and others as too sensitive to release. Trump promised during his campaign that he would not only revive waterboarding, but bring back \u201ca hell of a lot worse\u201d if elected. However, he said more recently that retired Marine Corps General James Mattis, his nominee for secretary of defense, had persuasively argued against it. Obama ended the use of \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d via executive order just after he took office in January 2009. Led by Republican Senator John McCain and Feinstein, Congress has since passed legislation outlawing their use. ",

        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The battlefield deaths of two leaders of an Islamic State alliance in the southern Philippines could thrust a Malaysian who trained at an Al-Qaeda camp in Afghanistan as the militant group s new regional  emir , experts and officials say. Intelligence officials describe Malaysian Mahmud Ahmad as a financier and recruiter, who helped put together the coalition of pro-Islamic State (IS) fighters that stormed Marawi City in May.  Isnilon Hapilon, Islamic State s anointed  emir  in Southeast Asia, and Omarkhayam Maute, one of two Middle East-educated brothers at the helm of the militant alliance, were killed in a raid on a building in Marawi and their bodies  recovered on Monday, Philippine Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said. Philippine authorities said they were still searching for Mahmud.  Based on our information, there is still one personality, Dr. Mahmud of Malaysia, and he is still in the main battle area with some Indonesians and Malaysians,  military chief, Gen. Eduardo Ano, said on Monday.  But their attitude is now different, they are no longer as aggressive as before.  He did not elaborate. Ano urged the 30 militants remaining in a shrinking combat zone to surrender and free hostages as troops stepped up their fight. Abdullah Maute, the alliance s military commander, was reported killed in August, though no body was found. Intelligence officials in Malaysia believe Mahmud left Marawi months ago. Malaysia s police counter-terrorism chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay told Reuters in July that Mahmud  managed to sneak out from Marawi city to another safe place with his followers .  The 39-year-old Mahmud, who holds a doctorate in religious studies and was a university lecturer in Kuala Lumpur, was Hapilon s second-in-command in the IS s Southeast Asia  caliphate , according to a July report by Indonesia-based Institute of Policy Analysis and Conflict (IPAC).  Sitting in the inner circle of the Marawi command center, Mahmud controlled recruitment and financing, the IPAC report said. He was the contact for foreigners wanting to join the fight in the Philippines or with IS in the Middle East, it said.  It wasn t just Indonesians and Malaysians contacting Dr. Mahmud ... he was also the contact for Bangladeshis in Malaysia who wanted to join the fighting in Mindanao,  IPAC s director Sidney Jones told Reuters. Rohan Gunaratna, an analyst at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, described Mahmud as  the most important IS leader in Southeast Asia . Ahmad El-Muhammady, a lecturer at the International Islamic University of Malaysia (IIUM) and a counter-terrorism advisor to the police, said Mahmud often solicited funds for IS operations.   He s always the one asking people  does anyone have any money they d like to donate? , and he will usually reply when followers in the region ask him about the situation in the Philippines,  Ahmad said. Mahmud grew up in Batu Caves, a crowded Kuala Lumpur suburb, famous for a Hindu temple housed in a large complex of caverns.  Mahmud s wife and three children were last known to be living there, although Reuters could not locate them. Before leaving Malaysia in 2014, Mahmud taught young Muslim students at a tahfiz, a school to memorise the Koran, in Nakhoda, a village near Batu Caves, residents said.   When he (Mahmud) started the school, he did stay there for the first one or two years, but then he just disappeared,  said 50-year-old Zainon Mat Arshad, a Nakhoda resident who went to the mosque where Mahmud prayed.    When he was at the tahfiz school, he kept mostly to himself and if he had come over to pray on Friday, I don t think anyone would have recognized him,  said Zainon.  He didn t mingle with the local community.  Security experts say Mahmud studied at Pakistan s Islamabad Islamic University in the late 1990s before going to Afghanistan where he learned to make improvised explosive devices at an al Qaeda camp.  In 2000, he returned to Malaysia to get a doctorate, which earned him a post as a lecturer in the Islamic Studies faculty at the University of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur. Former students described Mahmud as a quiet person who kept to himself.  He wasn t the kind of lecturer who hung out at cafes with his students as some others did,  said one former student, who declined to be identified. The few signs of his militant beliefs were discovered later, including a book he wrote on jihad under his nom de guerre, Abu Handzalah, said Ahmad, the IIUM lecturer.       He was put on Malaysia s most-wanted list in April 2014 after leaving the country with several others, including his aide, a Malaysian bomb maker named Mohammad Najib Husen, to work with the Abu Sayyaf group, notorious for violent kidnappings and beheadings in the southern Philippines, Ahmad said.  Mahmud received funding for the Marawi operation directly from IS headquarters, through the group s Southeast Asian unit led by Syrian-based Indonesian militant Bahrumsyah, the IPAC report said.    In a video released by the Philippines army in June, Mahmud is seen alongside Hapilon as well as Omarkhayam and Abdullah Maute - the pair of brothers who orchestrated the Marawi siege.

        "title": "Democrats raise doubts about Trump's high court nominee Gorsuch",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court nominee, on Monday emphasized the need for judicial independence even as Trump castigates jurists who have ruled against him, while Democrats questioned whether he would rule against abortion rights and gun control while favoring corporations. With the ideological balance of the Supreme Court at stake, the Senate Judiciary Committee opened its confirmation hearing for Gorsuch, a conservative federal appeals court judge from Colorado. Republicans praised Gorsuch, 49, as highly qualified for a lifetime appointment as a justice. \u201cI think we\u2019re off to a good start,\u201d Republican Chuck Grassley, the committee\u2019s chairman, said afterward, with senators getting their first shot at questioning Gorsuch on Tuesday. Committee Democrats noted Gorsuch has the chance to join the court only because Senate Republicans last year refused to consider Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of federal appellate judge Merrick Garland. Despite slim chances of blocking his nomination in the Republican-led Senate, Democrats raised questions about Gorsuch\u2019s suitability for the job. \u201cOur job is to determine whether Judge Gorsuch is a reasonable, mainstream conservative or is he not,\u201d said the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein. Speaking publicly for the first time since Trump nominated him on Jan. 31, Gorsuch defended his judicial record in the face of Democratic criticism of his rulings.  Gorsuch, speaking mostly in generalities that could not cause him any trouble, emphasized the need for \u201cneutral and independent judges to apply the law,\u201d warned against judicial overreach, and referred to \u201cthe modest station we judges are meant to occupy in a democracy.\u201d \u201cIf judges were just secret legislators, declaring not what the law is but what they would like it to be, the very idea of a government by the people and for the people would be at risk,\u201d Gorsuch said in comments in harmony with conservative criticism of unelected \u201cactivist judges.\u201d Gorsuch, a cool-headed and amiable jurist, gave Democrats very little ammunition to use against him, although there could be more drama when he takes questions. The hearing could last four days, providing classic Washington political theater. Grassley said the panel is likely to vote on the nomination on April 3, with the full Senate vote likely soon after. If Gorsuch is confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he would restore a narrow 5-4 conservative court majority. The seat has been vacant for 13 months, since the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal underscored the importance of judicial independence at a time when Trump has excoriated federal judges who have ruled against him on matters including two executive orders, put on hold by courts, to block people from several Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. Blumenthal said it was not \u201cidle speculation\u201d to suggest the Supreme Court might be asked to enforce a subpoena against Trump, citing FBI Director James Comey\u2019s testimony before Congress on Monday confirming an ongoing investigation into alleged collusion between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia.  Republican Ted Cruz said there is no reason for Gorsuch to be questioned about Trump, noting that previous nominees have not had to speak about allegations made against the president who nominated them. Democrats highlighted cases on which Gorsuch has ruled and questioned the influence of conservative interest groups in advising Trump on his selection. Feinstein emphasized abortion. Conservatives have long opposed the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion nationwide. Feinstein called that ruling and others since then buttressing abortion rights \u201csuper precedents\u201d deserving special deference. Feinstein cited two Gorsuch legal opinions in which she said he \u201cargued in favor of making it harder to convict felons who possess guns.\u201d Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy said he was worried that Gorsuch\u2019s conservative method of interpreting the Constitution \u201cgoes beyond being a philosophy and becomes an agenda\u201d that is anti-abortion, anti-environment and pro-business. \u201cWill you allow the government to intrude on Americans\u2019 personal privacy and freedoms? Will you elevate the rights of corporations over those of real people? Will you rubberstamp a president whose administration has asserted that executive power is not subject to judicial review?\u201d Leahy said. Many Democrats contend Trump\u2019s party \u201cstole\u201d a Supreme Court seat by freezing out Garland. \u201cYour nomination is part of a Republican strategy to capture our judicial branch of government,\u201d Senator Dick Durbin told Gorsuch. \u201cThat is why the Senate Republicans kept this Supreme Court seat vacant for more than a year and why they left 30 judicial nominees who had received bipartisan approval of this committee to die on the Senate calendar as President Obama left office.\u201d Gorsuch said he has tried to treat all who come to court fairly and with respect. \u201cI have decided cases for Native Americans seeking to protect tribal lands, for class actions like one that ensured compensation for victims of nuclear waste pollution by corporations in Colorado,\u201d he said. He also said he has ruled for disabled students, prisoners and workers alleging civil rights violations, and for immigrants who entered the country illegally. The court\u2019s ideological leaning could help determine the outcome of cases involving the death penalty, abortion, gun control, environmental regulations, transgender rights, voting rights, immigration, religious liberty, presidential powers and more. Republicans hold 52 of the Senate\u2019s 100 seats. Under present rules, Gorsuch would need 60 votes to secure confirmation. If Gorsuch cannot muster 60, Republicans could change the rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority. ",

        "title": "Trump signs memo directing Pentagon to implement transgender ban",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Friday that directs the U.S. military not to accept transgender men and women as recruits and halts the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgeries for active personnel unless the process is already underway. The memo, released by the White House, laid out in more detail a ban on transgender individuals serving in the U.S. armed forces that Trump announced via Twitter last month, reversing a policy shift started under his predecessor, President Barack Obama. In it, Trump directed the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security to stop using government funds for sex-reassignment procedures unless it is necessary \u201cto protect the health of an individual who has already begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex,\u201d the memo said. The order requires Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis to determine in the coming months how to handle transgender individuals currently serving in the military using criteria including \u201cmilitary effectiveness and lethality,\u201d budget constraints and law. A White House official who briefed reporters about the memo declined to specify whether transgender service men and women who are currently active in the military could continue to serve based on such criteria. The official said Trump decided the Obama administration had not identified a sufficient basis for changing what was then long-standing policy on transgender troops. The memo called on Mattis to submit a plan to Trump by February 21, 2018, on how to implement the changes. Trump\u2019s decision appealed to some in his conservative political base while creating uncertainty for thousands of transgender service members, many of whom came out after the Pentagon said in 2016 it would allow transgender people to serve openly. The change drew swift criticism from advocates of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights. \u201cThe President\u2019s order to remove transgender service members from the United States armed forces and deny them healthcare is nothing less than a purge,\u201d Matt Thorn, executive director of OutServe-SLDN, a group dedicated to LGBT equality in the military, said in a statement. \u201cOur military is strongest when all people who are fit to serve have the opportunity to do so. This unprecedented policy amounts to a purge of qualified, contributing troops, and will serve only to undermine unit cohesion and weaken military readiness,\u201d said Jennifer Levi, an official at the gay rights group GLAD (GLBTQ Legal Advocates\u00a0& Defenders) in a statement. Asked how the policy squared with Trump\u2019s pledge to stand up for gay rights, the White House official said the president would ensure that such rights were protected but had been critical previously of the transgender changes under the Obama administration.

        "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Thursday condemned a pre-election video in the United States promoting Republican front-runner Donald Trump at Hillary Clinton\u2019s expense, complaining that it unfairly \u201cdemonized\u201d Russia. The Kremlin did not spell out what its exact objection to the political attack video was. But its portrayal of President Vladimir Putin as one of Washington\u2019s toughest opponents alongside Islamic State, a group the Kremlin says it is fighting in Syria, is likely to have stirred anger among officials.   \u201cI saw this clip. I do not know for sure if Vladimir Putin saw it. (But) our attitude is negative,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a teleconference with reporters. The video tries to cast doubt over the ability of Clinton, the Democratic Party\u2019s likely presidential candidate, to contend with Putin in the event of her winning the November election. Presenting what it suggests are the United States\u2019 toughest opponents, it shows Putin throwing an opponent in a judo bout before cutting to footage of Mohammed Emwazi, the late Islamic State executioner nicknamed \u201cJihadi John\u201d.    It then shifts to a clip of Clinton which has been edited to make it appear as if she is barking like a dog. Putin is then shown laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s an open secret for us that demonizing Russia and whatever is linked to Russia is unfortunately a mandatory hallmark of America\u2019s election campaign,\u201d said Peskov. \u201cWe always sincerely regret this and wish the (U.S.) electoral process were conducted without such references to our country.\u201d Until now, the Kremlin has largely held off criticising Trump. Putin and Trump have lavished praise on one another in the past after the Republican front-runner spoke out in favour of building bridges with the Kremlin and of working together to fight terrorism. Russian state TV, which usually closely reflects the Kremlin\u2019s world view, has also generally been more positive about Trump than the other presidential candidates, suggesting his policies are more Russia-friendly. But state TV has at the same time complained about what it says is the anti-Russian tenor of the overall campaign, criticising most candidates for what it has described as their hysterical Cold War-style statements on Russia. The United States has accused Russia during its aerial bombing campaign in Syria of not targeting Islamic State targets with the same ferocity or frequency it has demonstrated against what Washington says are more moderate groups opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.   Moscow, an ally of Assad, has denied that charge, declaring Islamic State a dangerous threat to its own national security.  ",

Ford announced last week it would abandon plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and would invest $700 million in a Michigan plant over four years, while Fiat Chrysler said Sunday it will invest $1 billion and add 2,000 jobs at plants in Ohio and Michigan to build new SUVs and pickup trucks. Both companies have said they made the decision for business reasons and not because of pressure from Trump, but praised the president-elect for seeking to improve the climate for businesses to operate in the United States. Fiat Chrysler chief executive Sergio Marchionne said at the Detroit auto show on Monday that the decision had been in the works for a long time and was \u201ccoincidental\u201d to Trump\u2019s tweet last week criticizing the company. \u201cWe didn\u2019t twist ourselves into a pretzel (to make this decision)... It wasn\u2019t a preemptive strike against a tweet,\u201d Marchionne said during a roundtable discussion. Marchionne was asked about tariffs that Trump has threatened to impose on vehicles imported to the United States from Mexico and elsewhere and he said that Fiat Chrysler will live with any new rules. However, he added that it was \u201cquite possible\u201d that heavy tariffs on Mexican imports could force the company to close Mexican plants. Trump, a real estate developer who takes office on Jan. 20, has repeatedly singled out companies in the auto sector and other industries for not doing more to keep jobs in the United States. Trump, a Republican, also criticized Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) last week for shifting production of its Corolla from Canada to Mexico. The company has said there is no impact on U.S. employment as a result of the change. \u201cIt\u2019s finally happening - Fiat Chrysler just announced plans to invest $1BILLION in Michigan and Ohio plants, adding 2000 jobs,\u201d Trump said in a tweet on Monday. In a follow up tweet, he added: \u201cFord said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U.S. instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico. Thank you Ford & Fiat C(hrysler).\u201d Ford announced on Monday it will build the Bronco SUV and Ranger pickup at its Wayne assembly plant but will shift production of its Ford Focus car. Because of low demand, it will shift the Focus to an existing Mexican factory, rather than to a new factory as was announced in April. ",

Volkswagen agreed to spend $1.2 billion nationally and $800 million more in California on electric vehicle technology as penalties for equipping hundreds of thousands of diesel vehicles sold in the United States with software designed to cheat tailpipe emissions tests. The letter from Representative Anne Eshoo comes ahead of an Oct. 18 hearing at which a federal judge will consider whether to give final approval to $15.3 billion in settlements for owners, state and federal regulators or require changes and renegotiation. A provision \u201cof particular concern\u201d allows VW to make \u201cpossible investments in its own proprietary technology and subsidiaries,\u201d Eshoo, a Democrat, said in the Oct. 4 letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lisa McCarthy. The EPA declined to comment. VW was not immediately available for comment. It has urged the court approve the deal. Eshoo\u2019s fears mirror those raised by electric car-charging station companies in August. Four members of the California state legislature, in comments to the U.S. Department of Justice, also urged independent oversight and administration of the VW funds \u201cto ensure that multiple vendors with cutting-edge technology are able to enter the market.\u201d  The Justice Department said last month it received 1,195 comments period from private citizens, state and local government offices and agencies, businesses, and institutions and associations. The DOJ urged the agreements be approved with only minor changes.  Objectors face an uphill battle since U.S. courts generally give the government significant latitude to negotiate settlements.  The Justice Department said nearly half of the comments were submitted on behalf of a company that provides truck-stop electrification services to long-haul truck drivers, IdleAir, urging that the VW program be allowed to fund such projects.

The migrants were intercepted near the town of Zliten by one of several coastguard vessels that Italy repaired and delivered to Libya earlier this year. Libya s western shoreline is the main departure point for migrants trying to reach Europe by boat, many of them fleeing conflict or poverty. Crossings have dropped sharply since July, when an armed group in the smuggling hub of Sabratha began blocking departures. Under pressure from Italy and other European states, Libya s coastguard has also become increasingly active, patrolling more widely and intercepting migrants before they can reach international rescue vessels.

More than 111,000 had crossed to Italy, the vast majority from Libya.

The alert, from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, said North Korean hackers were using a type of malware known as  FALLCHILL  to gain entry to computer systems and compromise network systems.  The FBI and DHS had issued a warning in June that squarely blamed the North Korean government for a raft of cyber attacks stretching back to 2009 targeting media, aerospace and financial sectors, as well as critical infrastructure, in the United States and globally. Tuesday s alert included the publication of IP addresses   the FBI said were linked to the hacking campaign and was intended to help private industry guard against the attacks. The FALLCHILL malware was described as providing hackers with wide latitude to monitor and disrupt infected systems. The malware typically gained access to systems as a file sent via other North Korean malware or when users unknowingly downloaded it by visiting sites compromised by the hackers. The new alert coincides with increasing tensions between Washington and Pyongyang over North Korea s missile tests. The previous warning, in June, said that North Korea would continue to rely on cyber operations to advance its military and strategic objectives.

        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May won a modest reprieve in stalled Brexit talks on Friday, with European Union leaders signaling their readiness to move the negotiations forward in the coming months. But despite a more positive tone, a weakened May now faces a delicate political balancing act as she tries to meet EU demands for more concrete pledges on Britain s divorce bill without stoking a backlash from Brexit campaigners at home, some of whom would prefer she walk away from the talks. EU leaders said at a summit in Brussels that they would begin preparations to move into  phase two  of the Brexit negotiations in December, a step forward that would allow London to discuss its future trade relationship with the bloc. Yet they also made clear that May would have to move between now and the end of the year on settling a financial bill that EU officials have estimated at around 60 billion euros.  I think it is very clear what additional steps need to be taken,  German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference at the end of the summit, saying movement on the financial settlement was crucial for progress in December. French President Emmanuel Macron was tougher, saying the two sides had not yet completed even half of the work on the financial settlement and accusing Britain of  bluffing  by using the media to suggest there could be no deal.  A lot is in the hands of Theresa May,  he said. An EU official said it took just 90 seconds for the 27 other leaders to adopt their Brexit conclusions at the end of the meeting, underlining how united they are. May has said she cannot provide a specific financial pledge until she knows the shape of the future relationship. The EU is insisting that the two sides agree on an exit bill, the rights of EU citizens in a post-Brexit world and Irish border issues before delving into future ties. Asked whether she had improved an offer of about 20 billion euros, May said she had repeated commitments she made in a speech in Italy last month, when she said the bloc would not be out of pocket when it came to its budget which runs until 2020.  What I made clear to my EU counterparts in relation to financial contributions... is that nobody need be concerned for the current budget plans ... and that we will honor the commitments that we have made during our membership,  she told a news conference before returning to Britain.  Now there has to be detailed work on those commitments... we are going through them line by line and we will continue to go through them line by line.  The final text from the EU-27 read:  The European Union ... notes that, while the UK has stated that it will honor its financial obligations taken during its membership, this has not yet been translated into a firm and concrete commitment from the UK to settle all of these obligations.  Still, the leaders held open the hope of reaching a deal at the next regular summit in December. And in a move that could save weeks of delay, they ordered EU negotiators to start preparing for what Brussels will want in a transition period. Uncertainty over the final shape of a Brexit deal has unsettled businesses on both sides of the Channel. Terry Scuoler, CEO of the British manufacturers  association (EEF), welcomed the warmer words from EU leaders, but said industry needed  more than a hint of progress . All the EU leaders worked hard to strike a positive tone at the summit after May used a dinner late on Thursday to appeal to the other 27 leaders to help her silence critics at home by offering a signal that the talks would move on. Many were upbeat and May struck up an animated and friendly conversation at the beginning of the summit with Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who are both seen in Britain as hardliners in the talks. That might be enough for May to calm immediate concerns at home after Brexit campaigners urged the British prime minister to signal her readiness to leave the EU without a deal and to rely on World Trade Organization rules. But she faces a major dilemma as she gears up for the next EU summit in December.  The next eight weeks will be the most challenging for ... Theresa May and the most consequential for Brexit,  said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group. The chair of the summit Donald Tusk said there would need to be a more positive narrative to reach a Brexit deal in December - a sentiment echoed by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.  We have some details but we don t have all the details we need,  he said.  It s not my working assumption that we ll have no deal.  ",

But WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo told a news conference he thought the arguments in favor of global trade needed to be put more forcefully. He said he had warned before Britain\u2019s referendum last month of the risks of leaving the European Union, saying it would require years of complex trade talks to complete, but \u201csometimes people don\u2019t want to hear the arguments\u201d.  Appearing on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on July 24, Trump said U.S. companies that move production to Mexico should be taxed and shrugged off suggestions this would break WTO rules. \u201cWe\u2019re going to renegotiate or we\u2019re going to pull out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think trade is so obviously positive for every economy that it\u2019s like trying to argue with a friend that he needs to breathe,\u201d Azevedo said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think we do enough in making the case for trade.\u201d Azevedo, who said earlier on Wednesday that he would seek a second four-year term as the head of the WTO, said he was impressed by the number of people who had responded to Trump by speaking up for trade, \u201csometimes from unexpected quarters\u201d. He declined to comment on what would happen if the United States did withdraw from the 21-year-old trading club, which now boasts 163 members and governs the vast majority of global commerce through a system of mutually agreed rules. Under President Barack Obama, the WTO has been an important arena for the United States to defend its commercial interests against China, India and other major trading powers.  A debate over trade also raged before Britain\u2019s June 23 referendum on leaving the European Union. Britain voted in favor of Brexit despite warnings from Azevedo and others about the risks, and the country now faces years of protracted and complex trade talks to try to extricate itself from the EU. Asked how to improve the quality of debate and help voters understand the issues, Azevedo said people sometimes make decisions \u201con a basis of things that is completely foreign to the rationale of the issue that you are discussing.

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Lawmakers from Britain s ruling Conservative Party vented their anger on Wednesday against Prime Minister Theresa May s pursuit of welfare reforms, reinforcing doubts about her authority over a party divided by Brexit.  Several members of May s party spoke out against the government during a symbolic debate in parliament by demanding changes or even an outright halt to the implementation of a new welfare payment system which has been dogged by design problems. May leads a minority government, propped up by a small Northern Irish party, faced with the task of delivering a smooth departure from the European Union - something which requires a deeply split parliament to approve large amounts of new legislation. The opposition Labour Party won a symbolic vote on a motion calling for the welfare plan to be paused, but May s party avoided a full blown public rebellion by ordering its lawmakers to abstain, thereby masking the extent of internal unrest.  The Labour motion passed by 299 votes to zero with one Conservative rebel, but does not force the government to act.    Nevertheless, Conservative lawmakers openly criticized the government s approach and demanded changes during the debate  Why are we undermining a policy with the potential to change lives for the better by not addressing a fundamental flaw at its heart?  said Sarah Wollaston, the only Conservative lawmaker to formally vote against the government s orders. The defeat comes as ahead of debates on Brexit legislation, which had been expected to start this week but have yet to be scheduled. Ministers are sifting through hundreds of proposed changes, some of which are backed by enough Conservative lawmakers to inflict a more damaging defeat on May s government.  Labour, which wants to topple May s government and take control of the troubled Brexit process, had urged Conservative lawmakers to rebel on the welfare vote and later called the tactical abstention a sign of the government s weakness.  Yet again the prime minister and the Tories (Conservatives) cannot command a majority in the House of Commons. The prime minister is in office but not in power,  said Labour s welfare spokeswoman Debbie Abrahams after the vote. Welfare minister David Gauke accused the Labour Party of trying to wreck the reforms and vowed to listen to lawmakers  concerns but proceed with the policy. The welfare reform, known as  Universal Credit , is designed to simplify payments to claimants by consolidating six different types of state benefits into one.  The policy was first implemented for a small number of claimants in 2013 under May s predecessor David Cameron, but the expansion of the program to more people has been beset by long delays and criticism that it risks harming vulnerable citizens. The government is pressing ahead with the latest phase of the program despite concerns voiced by lawmakers from all parties that claimants must wait six weeks for payment. The government says they have taken measures to stop this happening. ",

        "text": "HAVANA (Reuters) - U.S. organizations that have worked closely with the outgoing Obama administration to improve relations with Cuba on Tuesday released a four-page letter to President-elect Donald Trump urging him not to act rashly toward the Communist-run nation. The Cuban Study Group, an organization of Cuban-American business leaders who favor engagement, and the Washington-based Engage Cuba coalition, arranged what they termed the \u201cmemo\u201d which says, \u201cto reflexively reverse course could have pernicious consequences for U.S. economic and foreign policy interests and the prospects of evolutionary change in Cuba.\u201d The Trump transition includes five Cuban-Americans who are vocal opponents of detente and have close ties to Cuban-American lawmakers who are calling for a return to pre-Obama efforts to isolate Cuba. A number of other Trump appointees have expressed hostility toward the Obama administration\u2019s two-year effort to normalize relations. \u201cWe are confident that a close evaluation will confirm that constructive engagement \u2014 including the reduction of travel and commercial barriers \u2014 is the best strategy for supporting the Cuban people and boosting U.S. jobs and exports,\u201d the signers of the report, which include the U.S.-Cuba Business Council, the National Foreign Trade Council, the American Society of Travel Agents and the Association of International Educators, say. They argue that the policy has improved human rights on the island, sped the expansion of internet access, led to dialogue on sensitive issues, improved national security and created jobs, among other positive results. The report follows the release last week of a similar plea by dozens of U.S. agricultural organizations which argued Cuba was an important market for their products. Trump, a Republican, has said he will dismantle the still-fragile detente unless Cuba gives the United States a better deal, while providing no specifics. He is expected to review the Cuba engagement on taking office on Friday. Trump has named Jason Greenblatt, a Trump Organization executive and chief legal counsel, as negotiator for sensitive international issues, including Cuba. The normalization of relations between the old Cold War foes has included restoration of diplomatic relations, Obama\u2019s historic trip to Cuba, the signing of 18 cooperation agreements and the use of executive orders to punch holes in the embargo, which can be lifted only by the U.S. Congress, now controlled by Republicans. Travel to the island from the United States has increased, with the start of direct flights and cruises and the signing of  cellphone roaming agreements, but no manufacturing or significant trade deals have been reached.

        "text": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro looked to the world of digital currency to circumvent U.S.-led financial sanctions, announcing on Sunday the launch of the  petro  backed by oil reserves to shore up a collapsed economy. The leftist leader offered few specifics about the currency launch or how the struggling OPEC member would pull off such a feat, but he declared to cheers that  the 21st century has arrived!     Venezuela will create a cryptocurrency,  backed by oil, gas, gold and diamond reserves, Maduro said in his regular Sunday televised broadcast, a five-hour showcase of Christmas songs and dancing. The petro, he said, would help Venezuela  advance in issues of monetary sovereignty, to make financial transactions and overcome the financial blockade.       Opposition leaders derided the announcement, which they said needed congressional approval, and some cast doubt on whether the digital currency would ever see the light of day in the midst of turmoil. The real currency, the bolivar, is in freefall, and the country is sorely lacking in basic needs like food and medicine. Still, the announcement highlights how sanctions enacted this year by U.S. President Donald Trump s administration are hurting Venezuela s ability to move money through international banks.  Washington has levied sanctions against Venezuelan officials, PDVSA executives and the country s debt issuance.   Sources say compliance departments are scrutinizing transactions linked to Venezuela, which has slowed some bond payments and complicated certain oil exports. Maduro s pivot away from the U.S. dollar comes after the recent spectacular rise of bitcoin, which has been fueled by signs that the digital currency is slowly gaining traction in the mainstream investment world. The announcement bewildered some followers of cryptocurrencies, which typically are not backed by any government or central banks. Ironically, Venezuela s currency controls in recent years have spurred a bitcoin fad among tech-savvy Venezuelans looking to bypass controls to obtain dollars or make internet purchases. Maduro s government has a poor track record in monetary policy. Currency controls and excessive money printing have led to a 57 percent depreciation of the bolivar against the dollar in the last month alone on the widely used black market. That has dragged down the monthly minimum wage to a mere $4.30.  For the millions of Venezuelans plunged into poverty and struggling to eat three meals a day, Maduro s announcement is unlikely to bring any immediate relief.  Economists and opposition leaders say Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader, has recklessly refused to overhaul Venezuela s controls and stem the economic meltdown. He could now be seeking to pay bondholders and foreign creditors in the currency amid a plan to restructure the country s major debt burden, opposition leaders said, but the plan is likely to flop.  It s Maduro being a clown. This has no credibility,  opposition lawmaker and economist Angel Alvarado told Reuters.   I see no future in this,  added fellow opposition legislator Jose Guerra. Maduro says he is trying to combat a Washington-backed conspiracy to sabotage his government and end socialism in Latin America. On Sunday he said Venezuela was facing a financial  world war.  ",

        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European leaders agreed on Thursday to explore cuts in EU funds to Turkey that are linked to Ankara s stalled bid to join the bloc after German Chancellor Angela Merkel pressed for action in response to what she described as  unacceptable  Turkish behavior on human rights. While praising Turkey for taking in Syrian refugees, Merkel stuck with the tougher tone she adopted during her reelection campaign last month, although she stopped short of calling for an outright end to Ankara s decade-long push to join the bloc.  We asked the Commission to make recommendations on changing and reducing the pre-accession aid,  Merkel told reporters after the first day of an EU summit.  There is no majority for breaking off the talks immediately. On the other hand there is a great deal of scepticism about the current situation. I made the case tonight that we should seek dialogue with Turkey.  Earlier she said that the rule of law in Turkey was  moving in the wrong direction , in a reference to the large-scale purge that President Tayyip Erdogan has carried out following a failed coup attempt in July 2016. Other countries, including the Netherlands and Belgium, backed a diversion of the funds that EU candidate countries receive while they are in talks to join the bloc.  Everyone knows that those negotiations are de facto frozen, are de facto almost dead,  Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told a news conference. Launched in 2005 after decades of seeking the formal start of an EU membership bid, Ankara s membership negotiations were always sensitive for France and Germany because of Turkey s status as a large, mainly Muslim country. But the scope of Erdogan s response to last year s coup attempt, his detention of U.S. and European citizens including dual nationals, and his jibes at Germany and the Netherlands for what he has called  Nazi-like  behavior. Aside from money that the EU gives Turkey as part of its  2016 migration deal, Ankara is set to receive 4.4 billion euros from the EU between 2014 and 2020. Some northern countries say aid meant to help Turkey reform politically now makes no sense because Ankara has cracked down so dramatically after the failed coup. With 50,000 people jailed pending trial, including German-Turkish nationals, EU membership also looks more distant than ever, EU officials say. Turkey is set to receive almost 500 million euros next year for the EU s common budget and European governments are discussing how much to limit that while not hitting projects such as infrastructure and agriculture. The European Parliament has proposed reducing the transfer by 50 million euros next year, with another 30 million euros set aside for further cuts should the relationship with Turkey deteriorate even more. A vote is expected on Wednesday.  Providing Turkey money for political reforms does not make sense given the situation,  said Siegfried Muresan, a center-right EU lawmaker who is leading EU budget in the parliament. However, EU governments are divided, with Poland, Britain and Sweden maintaining their strong support for Turkey s EU membership and countries such as Austria demanding not just a freeze to accession funds but an end to membership talks.

        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s full remarks to several Wall Street audiences appeared to become public on Saturday when the controversial transparency group Wikileaks dumped its latest batch of hacked emails. The documents showed comments by Clinton during question-and-answer sessions with Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and Tim O\u2019Neill, the bank\u2019s head of investment management, at three separate events in 2013 in Arizona, New York and South Carolina.  Some excerpts of Clinton\u2019s speeches had already been released. For more than a week, Wikileaks has published in stages what it says are hacked emails from the account of John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.  Clinton\u2019s campaign has declined to verify the emails. Goldman Sachs did not immediately provide any comment on Saturday. Clinton came under fire for months for not releasing full details of her paid speeches to big business audiences, as opponents accused her of a cozy relationship with bankers and other members of the U.S. financial system. The excerpts that have surfaced so far angered voters who backed Clinton\u2019s former Democratic opponent, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who endorsed her after losing the party\u2019s primary. Few of these voters are expected to vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump, who is dealing with his own larger scandal after the release last week of a 2005 video in which he bragged about making unwanted sexual advances toward women. But Democratic strategists worry that disappointment with Clinton could hurt turnout in the Nov. 8 election among liberals and younger voters, posing a potential problem for the former secretary of state. In the email released on Saturday containing the transcripts, Clinton campaign staff highlighted sections that could pose problems, including saying \u201cpolitical reasons\u201d factored into passing the 2010 Dodd-Frank law on Wall Street reforms and, while talking about regulation, saying the people who work in the industry know it best.

        "text": "GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) should overturn its decision to appoint Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe as a goodwill ambassador, global health leaders said on Saturday, describing the move as unjustifiable and wrong. Britain said Mugabe s appointment was  surprising and disappointing  and added that it risked overshadowing the WHO s global work. The United States, which has imposed sanctions on Mugabe for alleged human rights violations, said it was  disappointed.   This appointment clearly contradicts the United Nations  ideals of respect for human rights and human dignity,  a U.S. State Department spokesperson said.   This selection underscores why the United States continues to push for U.N. reform and leadership actions that uphold our shared U.N. ideals.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced the appointment at a high-level meeting on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Uruguay on Wednesday. The meeting was attended by Mugabe, 93. He is blamed in the West for destroying his country s economy and numerous human rights abuses during his 37 years leading the country as either president or prime minister. In a speech, Tedros praised Zimbabwe as  a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the center of its policies to provide health care to all . The former Ethiopian health and foreign minister, who was elected last May as WHO s first African director-general, added:  Today I am also honored to announce that President Mugabe has agreed to serve as a goodwill ambassador on NCDs for Africa to influence his peers in his region to prioritize NCDs.  But the NCD Alliance, which represents 28 international health groups seeking to combat chronic diseases, said it was  shocked and deeply concerned  to hear of the appointment, given Mugabe s  long track record of human rights violations . Jeremy Farrar, a leading global health specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust charity also said the decision was  deeply disappointing and wrong  and called on Tedros to be brave and reverse it.  Robert Mugabe fails in every way to represent the values WHO should stand for and those that Dr Tedros has stood for since becoming DG and has done over many years,  Farrar said.  Brave leaders are willing to listen, rethink and overturn bad decisions, this is one such case,  he said. WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said the WHO chief had made the move seeking broad support for the agency s work.   Tedros has frequently talked of his determination to build a global movement to promote high-level political leadership for health,  he said by e-mail.  Human rights activists also criticized the move.  Hillel Neuer, executive director of the Geneva-based group UN Watch described the choice by WHO, a United Nations agency as  sickening .  The government of Robert Mugabe has brutalized human rights activists, crushed democracy dissidents, and turned the breadbasket of Africa   and its health system   into a basket-case,  he said. He noted that Mugabe himself had traveled to Singapore for medical treatment three times this year rather than in his homeland. ",

        "title": "Canada's Trudeau calls treatment of women in Mexico 'unacceptable'",
        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Canada s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday urged Mexican lawmakers to improve women s rights, delivering a sharp rebuke to a key trading partner that has struggled to curb years of femicide, drug violence and rights abuses.  In a visit to the Mexican capital amid tense talks in the United States to save the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Trudeau met human rights organizations that briefed him on the violence and challenges faced by many of the country s women. In an address at the Mexican Senate, Trudeau told lawmakers that the stories he had heard from the rights groups about the treatment of women were  unacceptable,  and pressed for gender imbalances to be addressed in an updated NAFTA.  I challenge you to use your position and power to strongly push for the rights of women and girls in Mexico,  Trudeau said.  We must move the needle forward on gender inequality.   Trudeau s comments serve as a reprimand of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto s failure to tackle years of drug crime. Violence against women in Mexico has risen dramatically since the previous administration declared war on organized drug trafficking about a decade ago.  Mexico and Canada share values, and that certainly includes gender equality and enhancing women s rights,  Pena Nieto s office said in a statement after a request for comment on Trudeau s remarks.  The National Citizen Observatory of Femicide (OCNF), which uses government statistics, reported that 2,735 women were murdered in Mexico last year, up sharply from 2,383 the year before. UN Women, a branch of the United Nations, says on its website that Mexico has taken steps in recent years to improve gender equality, but has struggled to fully implement and enforce its own regulations.  Trudeau and his wife arrived in Mexico City on Thursday and attended roundtable discussions with non-governmental organizations to discuss violence against women, human rights, free speech as well as the risks faced by journalists and activists. Although Trudeau did not give details on how an updated NAFTA could protect women s rights, he said that Canada supports broader inclusion of women in the world economy.   We know that the success of any society depends on the full participation of women across social, economic and political life,  he added. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday slammed China on a range of trade issues from its chronic industrial overcapacity to forced technology transfers and longstanding bans on U.S. beef and electronic payment services. The annual trade barriers list from the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s (USTR) office sets up more areas of potential irritation for the first face-to-face meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping next week in Florida. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, asked about his expectations for the meeting, told Fox News on Friday: \u201cWhat I would hope will come out would be a commitment to starting to abide by the rules and a commitment to working collaboratively to help reduce our deficit.\u201c USTR, controlled by the White House, said that Chinese government industrial policies and financial support for industries such as steel and aluminum have resulted in overproduction and a flood of exports that have distorted global markets and undermined competitors. \u201cWhile China has begun to take steps to address steel excess capacity, these steps have been inadequate to date and even fewer efforts have been taken by China in aluminum and other sectors,\u201d USTR said in the report. USTR released the list of trade irritants in 63 countries just after senior Trump trade officials announced an executive order to study the causes of U.S. trade deficits.  The report said China also is using a series of cybersecurity restrictions as part of an apparent long-term goal to replace foreign information and communications technology products and services with locally produced versions. USTR also accused China of using a range of measures to engineer the transfer of foreign technology to Chinese firms. They include denying financial or regulatory approvals to companies using foreign-owned intellectual property (IP) or that do not conduct research or manufacture products in China. \u201cChina also reportedly conditions foreign investment approvals on technology transfer to Chinese entities, mandates adverse licensing terms on foreign IP licensors, uses anti-monopoly laws to extract technology on unreasonable terms and subsidizes acquisition of foreign high technology firms to bring technology to the Chinese parent companies.\u201d Gaps in IP rights enforcement have allowed the misappropriation of foreign IP and trade secrets, both within and outside of China. USTR\u2019s criticisms are consistent with increasingly vocal concerns raised by international business groups about what they see as a worsening business climate for foreign firms in China, as well as China\u2019s goal to boost domestic manufacturing content in 10 sectors from robotics to biopharmaceuticals. Earlier this month, the European Union Chamber of Commerce said the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan amounts to a \u201clarge-scale import substitution plan aimed at nationalizing key industries\u201d or \u201cseverely curtailing the position of foreign business.\u201d USTR also brought up longstanding complaints about online piracy of movies, books, music, video games and software in China as well as a ban on U.S. beef that has been in place since 2003. It said delays in China\u2019s approval process for agricultural products derived from biotechnology also worsened in 2016, hurting U.S. corn exports. Ross, the commerce secretary, also said Trump will sign two executive orders on Friday. The first calls for a 90-day study by the Commerce Department into the causes of U.S. trade deficits, the results of which would be used to formulate policy. A second order would solve a problem involving collection of anti-dumping duties, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some $3 billion worth of duties that have never been collected because they set up straw-man importers that don\u2019t have any financial substance, so by the time the case ends, there\u2019s nobody there against whom you can assess the fine. So what these orders will do is require letters of credit or insurance company bonds or cash so there will be somebody against whom we can levy the fine,\u201d Ross said. ",

        "text": "PHOENIX (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump hinted on Tuesday that he would issue a pardon for Joe Arpaio, a controversial former sheriff convicted last month of criminal contempt in a racial profiling case. Trump, who had already held out the possibility of a pardon for Arpaio, decided against announcing it at a major rally in Arizona on Tuesday night but suggested that he would step in at some point. \u201cI\u2019ll make a prediction. I think he\u2019s going to be just fine, okay? But I won\u2019t do it tonight because I don\u2019t want to cause any controversy. But Sheriff Joe can feel good,\u201d he said.  Arpaio, an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration, was the sheriff of Maricopa County in Phoenix before he lost a re-election bid in 2016. Last month a judge found him guilty of contempt for intentionally defying a 2011 court order that barred his officers from stopping and detaining Latino motorists solely on suspicion that they were in the United States illegally. The judge in the underlying lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and others in 2007, held that such traffic stops were a violation of the motorists\u2019 constitutional rights. Arpaio, who was in office for 24 years, gained national prominence for his treatment of jail inmates and crackdown on undocumented immigrants.  Arpaio\u2019s situation resonated with the crowd of Trump supporters. \u201cDo the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?\u201d Trump asked, sparking loud applause and a chant of \u201cPardon Joe!\u201d  \u201cWas Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?\u201d Trump said. His mention of Arpaio seemed to contradict comments by White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, who told reporters earlier in the day that the subject would not come up. \u201cThere will be no discussion of that today at any point and no action will be taken on that front at any point today,\u201d she told reporters traveling on Air Force One.

(Reuters) - Officials for a Kentucky county will appeal a federal judge\u2019s ruling that invalidated its right-to-work law, the county\u2019s lawyer said on Thursday. The ruling came a year after labor organizations sued Hardin County after it passed an ordinance that prohibited unions from mandating its members pay dues in exchange for representation. So-called \u201cright-to-work\u201d laws allow employees at unionized employers to skip joining a union and avoid paying union dues. U.S. District Judge David Hale ruled on Wednesday evening that local regulation of union agreements is preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. Hale\u2019s order means that only states can implement such legislation. Democrats, who hold a majority in the state House of Representatives, have blocked repeated bills aiming to make Kentucky the 26th right-to-work state. \u201cThese illegal ordinances would have affected all working people, union and non-union, by decreasing wages, lowering median household incomes, increasing poverty and undermining workplace safety,\u201d said Kentucky State AFL-CIO President Bill Londrigan. Beginning in late 2014, several Kentucky counties began passing their own laws after advocates claimed Kentucky law granted counties the same abilities as the state. Proponents of right-to-work laws say they can be a tool to attract new businesses. The ruling affects only Hardin County in north-central Kentucky, one of 12 to have passed a right-to-work law. Four others have passed a first reading. Jim Waters, president of the Bluegrass Institute, said about 80 of Kentucky\u2019s 120 counties had considered passing a right-to-work law but were waiting for Hale\u2019s decision. John Lovett, a lawyer representing Hardin County, said the case pits the interests of local communities against the nation\u2019s most powerful labor unions. \u201cFew issues are more \u2018local\u2019 than what a working person is free to do with his or her own money,\u201d Lovett said.

        "title": "U.S. healthcare bill's collapse escalates Republican infighting",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The failure by President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans to dismantle Obamacare has infuriated the party\u2019s conservative flank and is intensifying intra-party warfare ahead of the 2018 U.S. congressional elections.  Donors and activists upset by the collapse of the latest Senate healthcare bill said it hardened their determination to back conservative candidates in next year\u2019s elections, even if that means ousting Republican incumbents. \u201cI am fed up. I\u2019m beyond frustrated,\u201d said Mica Mosbacher, a Houston-based Republican fundraiser, who added she was \u201cextremely disappointed in Ted Cruz,\u201d a Republican U.S. senator from Texas who had threatened to oppose the latest healthcare bill because he wanted to see changes. Texas is scheduled to hold the first nominating primary of the midterm elections in March 2018.  Trump vowed during the 2016 election campaign to scrap the 2010 Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement, which Republicans see as a costly government overreach. Democrats say it has extended health insurance to millions. The latest bill to overturn Obamacare failed on Tuesday after three Senate Republicans, including moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul, said they could not support it. Republicans narrowly control the chamber by 52-48.  In November 2018, all 435 seats of the U.S. House of Representatives and 33 seats in the Senate will be up for election. In the Senate, that includes 23 Democrats and eight Republicans, with several in both parties in fights expected to be competitive. If a large number of Republicans are forced to defend their seats against challengers from their own party in primary fights, Democrats will seek to exploit weakened candidates in the general election in their effort to wrest control of the House and Senate from Republicans. A shift of either chamber into Democratic hands would make it even more difficult for Trump to pass his agenda of tax reform, toughening immigration laws and rolling back Obamacare. Republicans have not delivered a significant legislative win on any topic since Trump took office in January.  Mosbacher said she was \u201cleaning toward supporting\u201d Cruz\u2019s primary opponent, Stefano de Stefano, even though she served as fundraiser for the incumbent\u2019s 2012 campaign. Whoever prevails in that fight would likely face Beto O\u2019Rourke, a well-funded Democrat, in the general election. Texas last elected a Democrat to the Senate in 1988. The conservative group Club For Growth has already begun interviewing Republican primary challengers it will consider backing next year.  \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to push for full repeal of Obamacare, and we\u2019re disappointed Republicans have been unable to deliver on their seven-year promise,\u201d said Rachael Slobodien, a spokeswoman for Club for Growth. Club for Growth is not alone in its frustration over the defeat of the Obamacare repeal effort. David Bozell, president of ForAmerica, a conservative grassroots organization, said incumbents who failed to line up solidly behind repeal had \u201cshown some true colors\u201d and in doing so, were inviting primary fights for their party\u2019s nomination. Republican Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada are top targets for conservative groups. Conservative Kelli Ward has already announced her candidacy challenging Flake, and is seeking to amass support as a more conservative option.  Dave Tamasi, a Republican lobbyist and fundraiser, said he thought it was too soon to know if the healthcare failure would hurt Republicans. \u201cOpponents may try to use today or the failure to pass a repeal of the Affordable Care Act to give their candidacy a little bit of a push. The question is can that fuel today sustain itself over the long term of an election cycle,\u201d he said. So far, Trump has been hedging his bets on the Republican primaries. But many of his allies are already backing conservative primary challengers. Trump has blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over Congress\u2019 inaction. Such criticisms could help turn next year\u2019s elections into a referendum on congressional incumbents, rather than on the president himself.  \u201cI think we are entering an era of more primary challenges in general, The disappointment by activists over the inability for Republicans to repeal Obamacare only adds fuel to this fire,\u201d said Craig Robinson, former political director of the Iowa Republican Party.

The party s leader, Victoire Ingabire, is already in jail, convicted of conspiring to form an armed group and other charges in 2013.

Ginsburg, the 83-year-old senior liberal member of the high court, inserted herself into the U.S. presidential election in recent days by making negative remarks about Trump in a series of media interviews.  Her earlier remarks prompted criticism from Trump, who said she should resign. In one of a series of Twitter posts, he also said Ginsburg\u2019s \u201cmind is shot.\u201d The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ginsburg\u2019s statement. Legal ethics scholars also questioned Ginsburg\u2019s actions, saying Supreme Court justices should stay out the political fray in order to maintain their judicial integrity. The New York Times and the Washington Post chided Ginsburg in editorial articles. \u201cJudges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office. In the future I will be more circumspect,\u201d Ginsburg said. In a CNN interview posted on Tuesday, Ginsburg called the presumptive Republican nominee \u201ca faker.\u201d In a separate interview with the New York Times, Ginsburg joked about moving to New Zealand if Trump wins the White House. Under a code of conduct that federal judges - but not Supreme Court justices - are required to follow, judges are forbidden from publicly endorsing or opposing candidates for public office.  Supreme Court justices generally shy away from discussing politics or other divisive issues in public. Ginsburg is one of the more outspoken members of the court but had never before made such pointed remarks about a political candidate. The controversy erupted as Trump prepared for the opening of the July 18-21 Republican convention, which will formally make him the party\u2019s presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election. The Supreme Court has been ideologically split between four liberals and four conservatives since conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died in February. ",

        "title": "Pakistan army pushed political role for militant-linked groups",
        "text": "LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - The backing of a candidate in a by-election last weekend in Pakistan by a political party controlled by an Islamist with a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head was in line with a plan put forward by the military last year to mainstream militant groups, according to sources familiar with the proposal. The Milli Muslim League party loyal to Hafiz Saeed - who the United States and India accuse of masterminding the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people   won 5 percent of the votes in the contest for the seat vacated when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was removed from office by the Supreme Court in July. But the foray into politics by Saeed s Islamist charity appears to be following a blueprint that Sharif himself rejected when the military proposed it in 2016, according to three government officials and a retired former general briefed on the discussions. None of the sources interviewed for this article could say for sure if the MML s founding was the direct result of the military s plan, which was not discussed in meetings after Sharif put it on ice last year. The MML denies its political ambitions were engineered by the military. The official army spokesman did not comment after queries were sent to his office about the mainstreaming plan and what happened to it. Pakistan s powerful military has long been accused of fostering militant groups as proxy fighters opposing neighboring arch-enemy India, a charge the army denies. Three government officials and close Sharif confidants with knowledge of the discussions said the military s powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) presented proposals for  mainstreaming  some militant groups in a meeting last year. They said that Sharif had opposed the  mainstreaming  plan, which senior military figures and some analysts see as a way of steering ultra-religious groups away from violent jihad.  We have to separate those elements who are peaceful from the elements who are picking up weapons,  said retired Lieutenant General Amjad Shuaib, adding that such groups should be  helped out to create a political structure  to come into the mainstream. The plan   which Shuaib told Reuters was shared with him by the then-head of the ISI -  said those who were willing  should be encouraged to come into the mainstream politics of the country . He added that in his capacity as a retired senior military officer he unofficially spoke to Hafiz Saaed and another alleged militant about the plan, and they were receptive.  Shuaib later said his comments in the interview were taken out of context and were part of a broader discussion about deradicalization strategies. Writing in a local newspaper on Wednesday he said the report  maliciously attributed some statements to me totally out of context, just to suit its own narrative . A spokesperson for Reuters said:  We stand by our reporting.  Saeed s religious charity launched the Milli Muslim League party within two weeks of the court ousting Sharif over corruption allegations.  Yaqoob Sheikh, the Lahore candidate for Milli Muslim League, stood as an independent after the Electoral Commission said the party was not yet legally registered.   But Saeed s lieutenants, JUD workers and MML officials ran his campaign and portraits of Saeed adorn every poster promoting Sheikh, who came in fourth place on Sunday with Sharif s wife taking the seat as expected. Another Islamist designated a terrorist by the United States, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, has told Reuters he too plans to soon form his own party to advocate strict Islamic law.  God willing, we will come into the mainstream - our country right now needs patriotic people,  Khalil said, vowing to turn Pakistan into a state government by strict Islamic law. Saeed s charity and Khalil s Ansar ul-Umma organization are both seen by the United States as fronts for militant groups the army has been accused of sponsoring. The military denies any policy of encouraging radical groups. Still, hundreds of MML supporters, waving posters of Saeed and demanding his release from house arrest, chanted  Long live Hafiz Saeed! Long live the Pakistan army!  at political rallies during the run-up to the by-election.  Anyone who is India s friend is a traitor, a traitor,  went another campaign slogan, a reference to Sharif s attempts to improve relations with long-time foe India that was a source of tension with the military. Both Saeed and Khalil are proponents of a strict interpretation of Islam and have a history of supporting violence - each man was reportedly a signatory to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden s 1998 fatwa declaring war on the United States. They have since established religious groups that they say are unconnected to violence, though the United States maintains those groups are fronts for funneling money and fighters to militants targeting India. Analyst Khaled Ahmed, who has researched Saeed s Jamaat-ud-Dawa charity and its connections to the military, says the new political party is clearly an attempt by the generals to pursue an alternative to dismantling its militant proxies.  One thing is the army wants these guys to survive,  Ahmed said.  The other thing is that they want to also balance the politicians who are more and more inclined to normalize relations with India.   The ISI began pushing the political mainstreaming plan in 2016, according to retired general Shuaib, a former director of the army s military intelligence wing that is separate from the ISI. He said the proposal was shared with him in writing by the then-ISI chief, adding that he himself had spoken with Khalil as well as Saeed in an unofficial capacity about the plan.  Fazlur Rehman Khalil was very positive. Hafiz Saeed was very positive,  Shuaib said.  My conversation with them was just to confirm those things which I had been told by the ISI and other people.  The ISI s main press liaison did not respond to written requests for comment. Saeed has been under house arrest since January at his house in the eastern city of Lahore. The United States has offered a $10 million reward for information leading to his conviction over the Mumbai attacks. Then-Prime Minister Sharif, however, was strongly against the military s mainstreaming plan, according to Shuaib and the three members of Sharif s inner circle, including one who was in some of the tense meetings over the issue. Sharif wanted to completely dismantle groups like JuD. Disagreement on what to do about anti-India proxy fighters was a major source of rancor with the military, according to one of the close Sharif confidants.  In recent weeks several senior figures from the ruling PML-N party have publicly implied that elements of the military - which has run Pakistan for almost half its modern history and previously ousted Sharif in a 1999 coup - had a hand in the court ouster of Sharif, a charge both the army and the court reject. A representative of the PML-N, which last month replaced him as prime minister with close ally Shahid Khaqi Abbasi, said the party was  not aware  of any mainstreaming plan being brought to the table.

        "title": "Trump's Supreme Court list: all conservative, some provocative",
        "text": "Scroll to the bottom of the page for an interactive graphic.\u00a0  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - William Pryor, in urging the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 to uphold a Texas law banning gay sex, argued against the notion that the U.S. Constitution should safeguard a person\u2019s choice of partners.  Pryor, who then was Alabama\u2019s attorney general and now serves on a federal appeals court, was one of 11 conservative jurists who presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has named as people he would consider nominating to the Supreme Court, if elected.  \u201cA constitutional right that protects \u2018the choice of one\u2019s partner\u2019 and \u2018whether and how to connect sexually\u2019 must logically extend to activities like prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality, possession of child pornography, and even incest and pedophilia,\u201d Pryor said in a legal filing to the Supreme Court.  Pryor has a record of provocative remarks, as do some others on Trump\u2019s list. But many have established solid conservative judicial records that likely would appeal to Republicans in the Senate, which has the power to confirm Supreme Court nominees, and have steered clear of inflammatory rhetoric.  Trump\u2019s list, unveiled on Wednesday, included judges who have indicated support for various conservative causes, range in age from 41 to 58 and hail primarily from conservative and Republican-governed states. The eight men and three women all are white.  The list\u2019s release seems to have reassured some conservatives who may have doubted Trump would name a genuine conservative to the high court, which has a vacancy following the February death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.  \u201cI\u2019ve heard nothing but positive about this. People in the Senate say this is going to relieve a lot of people,\u201d said Republican Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a key Trump supporter in the Senate.  The Republican-led Senate has refused to consider Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland, arguing the winner of the Nov. 8 election to determine Obama\u2019s successor should get to fill the post. Scalia\u2019s replacement could tip the ideological balance of the court, now evenly divided with four conservative justices and four liberals.  Don Willett of Texas is one of five state supreme court judges on the list. His job is an elected one.  \u201cDon Willett helped defend the right of Texas to display the (Bible\u2019s) Ten Commandments and fought the liberals who tried to remove the words \u2018under God\u2019 from our pledge\u201d of allegiance, his campaign said in a 2012 advertisement.  Before becoming a judge, Willett was part of Texas\u2019 legal team that won a Supreme Court battle to display the Ten Commandments on a monument in the state Capitol despite opponents\u2019 concerns that it amounted to government endorsement of a religion.  During Pryor\u2019s stint as Alabama attorney general from 1997 to 2004, he described the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion nationwide as \u201cthe worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.\u201d  Some of the judges on Trump\u2019s list have ruled against abortion and birth control rights.  Federal appeals court judges Diane Sykes, Steven Colloton and Pryor all ruled in favor of Christian objections to the mandate under Obama\u2019s healthcare law that health insurance covers birth control for women.  Federal appeals court judge Raymond Gruender wrote a 2012 ruling upholding a South Dakota law that requires doctors to inform patients that women who have abortions are more likely to commit suicide. Colloton, who sits on the same court, joined the opinion.  As on abortion and contraception, the U.S. Supreme Court is closely divided on the scope of the individual right to bear arms under the Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment.  In a 2013 case, Thomas Hardiman, another federal appeals court judge, dissented when the majority on his court upheld a New Jersey law regulating the possession of handguns in public. Hardiman endorsed a broad reading of Second Amendment gun rights that would protect carrying weapons outside the home for self-defense.  The list also includes David Stras, a member of Minnesota\u2019s Supreme Court. In 2014, that court waded into the contentious subject of when a person who is incapacitated may be taken off life support and allowed to die.  The court ruled, in the case of a 57-year-old man with irreversible brain damage, that a guardian who was given medical-consent power could authorize the removal of life-sustaining treatment when \u201cinterested parties\u201d agreed it would be in the incapacitated person\u2019s best interest.  Stras dissented, writing that because the man had already died when the case was heard, the matter was moot and the court should have stayed out of it.\u00a0  ",

        "title": "Clinton Foundation health project still mulling foreign donations",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The largest program of the Clinton Foundation, the family philanthropy of U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, is still weighing whether to continue accepting foreign donations should Clinton be elected, a spokeswoman said on Friday. It was reported on Thursday that the Clinton Foundation would no longer receive donations from foreigners or corporations if Clinton wins the election in November, an effort to defuse criticism that donors to the globe-straddling charity might inappropriately seek White House favors in return. But representatives of the charities confirmed on Friday that the new guidelines would only apply to a small portion of the foundation\u2019s activities, including its work on climate change and some of its work on economic development. The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), the foundation\u2019s flagship project credited with reducing the cost of life-saving HIV medicines in the developing world, is yet to decide if it will similarly introduce new limits on donors. \u201cCHAI is a separate legal entity from the Clinton Foundation with its own Board,\u201d Regan Lachapelle, a CHAI spokeswoman, said in an email. \u201cThe CHAI Board will be meeting soon to determine its next steps.\u201d  CHAI accounts for nearly 60 percent of the $250 million the foundation spent in 2014, according to the foundation\u2019s most recent annual report posted on its website. CHAI files separate tax returns from the Clinton Foundation, but is included in the foundation\u2019s audited expenses, annual reports and other promotional literature. Similarly, a Canadian offshoot of the foundation, the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada), or CGEP, will not be bound by the foundation\u2019s donor limits, but said it will instead become an \u201cindependent entity\u201d if Hillary Clinton becomes president. CGEP, which says Canadian law prevents it from disclosing its donors\u2019 names without their permission, was founded by Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president, and Canadian businessman Frank Giustra in 2007 to improve work opportunities for people in poor countries.  \u201cIf Secretary Clinton wins the election, we plan to spin CGEP into an independent entity to continue this important work,\u201d Giustra said in a statement. \u201cPresident Clinton and I believe it is important that we continue the work of alleviating poverty around the world.\u201d The statement did not specify Bill Clinton\u2019s future role. A spokesman for Clinton\u2019s campaign declined to answer questions about the foundation. The charities have received praise from public health experts for their work alleviating the spread of HIV, and Clinton\u2019s campaign has said any donor expecting political favors in return would be misguided. The family renamed their foundation the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013, although Hillary Clinton stepped down from her board position last year after announcing her presidential bid. Her husband and daughter remain board members. In 2008, Hillary Clinton signed an ethics agreement governing her family\u2019s charities in order to become President Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state. She promised that her family\u2019s charities would name all their donors on an annual basis and seek clearance from the U.S. State Department before accepting new donations from foreign government money. Last year, the charities said they did not comply with these promises, blaming \u201coversights.\u201d On Tuesday, the Boston Globe said in an editorial that the foundation should shut down. \u201cEven if they\u2019ve done nothing illegal, the foundation will always look too much like a conflict of interest for comfort,\u201d the editorial board wrote.

        "title": "Belarus crackdown throws U.S. sanctions relief in doubt",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration must decide by the end of this month whether to grant Belarus continued relief from U.S. economic sanctions despite a stiff government crackdown on street demonstrations last month. The renewal decision is considered a low-level priority for the administration, which is facing bigger questions about U.S. relations with Russia and China, and with most major diplomatic positions still unfilled. But whether the United States renews the sanctions relief or instead returns to blacklisting nine major Belarus companies is an early test for the Trump administration on the importance it puts on human rights versus efforts to coax countries in Russia\u2019s orbit to turn to the West. The sanctions waivers, which began in 2015 and were extended twice last year, were tied to domestic political reforms and intended to encourage Belarus, which has long historical ties to Russia, to move closer to the European Union and the United States. Now, however, U.S. officials are alarmed by the arrests of hundreds of people last month during an attempt to hold a street protest in the capital Minsk, and concerned if continuing sanctions relief could be seen as ignoring the crackdown. Belarus authorities last month raided a human rights group\u2019s offices and used violence against peaceful protesters, rights groups say. \u201cThis most recent crackdown sharpened people\u2019s focus,\u201d said a U.S. congressional aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cNow there is a real question about whether or not they (the sanctions) should be reimposed.\u201d The decision must be taken by the end of April. If the administration makes no decision, the sanctions will be re-imposed. NATO members, including Poland and the Baltic states, feel threatened by what they see as increased Russian intervention in Europe, including Moscow\u2019s annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region in 2014. \u201cBelarus is so important from a strategic point of view and it\u2019s so dependent economically on Russia that we are really very concerned,\u201d said Piotr Wilczek, the Polish ambassador to the United States. \u201cBelarus is becoming more and more part of this wider Russian problem we have.\u201d The Trump administration is inclined to renew the sanctions relief, but likely would wait until the last minute \u201cto make sure they don\u2019t do anything awful,\u201d said a U.S. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity. State and Treasury Department officials declined to comment in detail on the Belarus sanctions. The Belarus Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment. President George W. Bush in 2006 blacklisted top Belarus officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko, for undermining the country\u2019s democratic processes or human rights abuses. The United States later added large Belarus companies to the sanctions list. But in 2015, Lukashenko released political prisoners and indicated he was open to better relations with the West. That October, President Barack Obama temporarily lifted sanctions on nine Belarus companies, including petrochemical conglomerate Belneftekhim and tire manufacturer Belshina.  Now, however, Lukashenko appears to be keeping his country firmly in Moscow\u2019s orbit. In a letter to him last week, four U.S. senators said they were concerned over the crackdown and that he decided to allow Russia to conduct \u201cprovocative\u201d military exercises in Belarus later this year.

        "text": "SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Center-left Senator Alejandro Guillier and conservative billionaire Sebastian Pinera will go head to head in a runoff for Chile s presidency on Sunday, after securing the top two spots in the Nov. 19 first-round vote. There have been no major polls in the past month, leaving few indications of who will succeed outgoing center-left President Michelle Bachelet in the world s top copper producer. Below are the main proposals from both candidates:  - The former journalist, elected to the Senate in 2013, has promised to deepen the progressive tax, education and labor reforms of ideological ally Bachelet. His spending plan includes investments in housing and infrastructure and carries a price tag of $10 billion.  - Guillier has pledged to diversify Chile s economy away from copper, or add value to exports by processing the metal at home. He would seek a plebiscite in 2018 to rewrite the dictatorship-era constitution to include more protections for workers and indigenous communities.  - Since the first round, Guillier and Pinera have both endorsed a  public option  to compete with Chile s private pension funds. Once widely praised worldwide, they have been criticized for delivering too-small payouts. Guillier has also recommended a new, mandatory contribution from employers.  - Guillier and Pinera have both called for repeal of state-run copper producer Codelco s mandatory contribution of 10 percent of profits to the military. Guillier has signaled he would seek to maintain the government s strong ties with Codelco workers, something that has spared the company from strikes that have hit private miners under Bachelet. - The billionaire businessman, who served as president from 2010 to 2014, has promised to make Chile the first country in Latin America to achieve  developed nation  status in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based club of wealthy nations. - Pinera, the investor favorite, would cut corporate taxes to increase investment. He said his policies would double Chile s economic growth and eliminate poverty by 2025.  - Pinera s $14 billion, four-year spending plan includes an overhaul of Bachelet s tax reform, and $2.7 billion in new investments in infrastructure and hospitals. Pinera said he would pay for his proposals by cutting  unnecessary  government spending and simplifying the tax code. - Pinera wants to revitalize and increase competition in Chile s private pension system. His plan includes new subsidies to raise pensions for women and the middle class, as well as incentives to encourage workers to retire later. - He wants Codelco to deploy a  realistic investment plan using existing resources  and to focus on existing assets rather than new projects.

        "title": "Clinton offers plan to curb 'unjustified' price hikes on life-saving drugs",
        "text": "WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton said on Friday that if elected to the White House she would create an oversight panel to protect U.S. consumers from large price hikes on long-available, lifesaving drugs and to import alternative treatments if necessary, adding to her pledges to rein in overall drug prices. Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, would seek to give the panel an \u201caggressive new set of enforcement tools,\u201d including the ability to levy fines and impose penalties on manufacturers when there has been an \u201cunjustified, outlier price increase\u201d on a long-available or generic drug, her campaign said. \u201cOver the past year, we\u2019ve seen far too many examples of drug companies raising prices excessively for long-standing, life-saving treatments with little or no new innovation or R&D,\u201d Clinton said in a statement. If Clinton defeats Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election, she would need the support of the U.S. Congress to implement key measures of her proposal, which follows a broader plan to rein in drug prices that she announced a year ago. Even though her latest plan would likely affect a small number of companies, it could be difficult to get Republican lawmakers on board, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said, adding that a \u201cRepublican Congress would push back hard on this.\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign cited Turing Pharmaceuticals LLC\u2019s raising the price of its AIDS drug Daraprim (pyrimethamine) and Mylan NV\u2019s repeated steep price increases on EpiPen for severe allergy sufferers as \u201ctroubling\u201d examples of price hikes that have attracted bipartisan congressional scrutiny. Conover said Clinton\u2019s plan to address unjustified price hikes is less of a concern to the drug industry than her pledge last year to reduce drug prices overall. Drugmakers have said that lowering or limiting drug prices would hamper their ability to invest in research and lead to fewer new therapies. The ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers rose 0.30 percent on Friday, in line with gains for the broad stock market. Shares of Mylan fell 4.6 percent to $40.00 on the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq biotech index slipped 0.40 percent. The decline was slight compared to the more than 4.7 percent drop in the index seen on Sept. 21, 2015, when Clinton blasted \u201cprice gouging\u201d in the specialty drug market on Twitter, responding to reports that Turing had acquired Daraprim, an older antibiotic, and then hiked its price by 5,000 percent.  Soon afterward, Clinton presented a general plan to lower prescription drug costs, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and demand higher rebates for prescription drugs.  Her plan would also include caps on monthly and annual out-of-pocket costs for patients with chronic or serious health conditions. It aims to prohibit manufacturers from paying generic drugmakers to delay launching their cheaper products, and would eliminate corporate writeoffs for direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising. Dr. Peter Bach, the director of a nonpartisan health policy research group at New York\u2019s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said Clinton\u2019s announcement on Friday was a \u201cflag\u201d for drug manufacturers that her administration would notice and respond to steep price hikes. \u201cIt\u2019s a response to the broader industry phenomenon of generating added profits by raising the price of drugs for which there is no competition,\u201d Bach said, saying the campaign was focusing on a \u201csub-category\u201d of manufacturers that had not invested heavily in developing a drug. Bach said he was contacted by the Clinton campaign about his work on drug pricing but had not advised the campaign in a formal capacity. The oversight panel would be made up of representatives from existing public health and consumer protection agencies who convene to examine the scope of a drug price increase, the manufacturer\u2019s production cost and the treatment\u2019s relative value to patients and public health, Clinton\u2019s campaign said. Terry Haines, head of political analysis for Evercore ISI, said Clinton\u2019s proposed panel had little hope of getting through Congress.  But Clinton, if elected, might be able to achieve price reform via changes to Medicare\u2019s prescription drug benefit, known as Medicare Part D, if she works with Congress to reform the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, Haines said. In that event, Haines said shares of pharmaceutical and biotech companies could come \u201cunder sustained headline risk in 2017 as ACA reforms are discussed.\u201d         In cases where a price hike determined to be unjustified is accompanied by insufficient market competition, Clinton\u2019s administration would intervene to purchase alternative drugs from comparably regulated markets or assist manufacturers in bringing the product to market in the United States. Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, called it a \u201cbold idea\u201d to get the federal government \u201cinvolved in helping stabilizing some of these generic drug markets.\u201d Until recently, there was a lengthy wait for generic drug approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Although the wait time has shortened, there is often not enough consistent demand for manufacturers to enter the U.S. market, Kesselheim said. \u201cHaving the government get involved as a long-term purchaser of these products creates a stockpile to stabilize the market,\u201d he said. Kesselheim has testified before Congress about high-cost generic and long-available drugs and spoke to Clinton\u2019s campaign about his research as it developed its proposals. ",

        "title": "Romanian ruling party leader investigated over 'criminal group'",
        "text": "BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanian anti-corruption prosecutors opened an investigation on  Monday into the leader of the ruling Social Democrat Party, Liviu Dragnea, on suspicion of forming a  criminal group  to siphon off cash from state projects, some of them EU-funded.     Dragnea, currently on trial in a separate abuse-of-office case, told reporters he rejected the new charges. Opposition parties called on him to resign as parliament speaker pending the criminal inquiry. Prosecutors said Dragnea was suspected of forming  an organized criminal group  that included public servants and businesspeople in 2001. They said there were suspicions the group was still active.  The investigation focused on road construction firm Tel Drum SA, formerly controlled by the county council of the southern Teleorman region, a body that Dragnea headed until 2012, prosecutors said. Dragnea and eight other people conspired to privatize the company through intermediaries, so that it came under  the influence and control of the suspect Liviu Dragnea,  the prosecutors added. The company won many public contracts, at times without tenders or benefiting from confidential information that helped it beat other bidders, the prosecutors  statement said. Dragnea and people close to him received cash and other assets from it, the statement added. Tel Drum director Petre Pitis, also under investigation, declined to comment as he left a closed-door hearing at the office of anti-corruption prosecuting agency DNA. A company representative told Reuters that an official reaction was not expected on Monday.  The group of nine people was suspected of seeking to  fraudulently obtain important sums from public works contracts funded with domestic and European funds, by committing abuse of office, EU funds fraud, tax evasion, money laundering and accessing confidential information,  the DNA statement read. The case was based on a notice sent by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) in 2016 regarding suspicions that Dragnea and other regional officials had used forged papers to secure EU funds for road rehabilitations, prosecutors said.  I categorically do not feel guilty, I never formed a criminal group,  Dragnea told reporters. The 55-year-old, who got a suspended prison sentence last year for illegally using his influence within the party to sway a 2012 referendum, has dismissed past investigations as politically motivated. Opposition liberal Ioan Cupsa said Dragnea should resign.  Once more, he is making parliament and the image it has with public opinion vulnerable,  he was quoted saying by state news agency Agerpres. Dragnea said he had no intention of stepping aside. Transparency International ranks Romania among the European Union s most corrupt states. Brussels, which keeps Romania s justice system under special monitoring, has praised magistrates for their efforts to curb graft. The ruling Social Democrats are currently preparing a judicial overhaul the European Commission, foreign diplomats and Romania s own president have all said could place the justice system under political control. Thousands of Romanians protested against the overhaul earlier this month. At the start of 2017, attempts by the ruling coalition to weaken anti-corruption legislation triggered the country s biggest protests in decades. ",

        "title": "Abe hopes to avoid landing in rough in golf outing with Trump",
        "text": "(Reuters) - With golf long regarded as a stern measure of character and a natural setting for deal-making, U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s weekend outing in Florida could be viewed as more than a leisurely bonding exercise between two world leaders. U.S. President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Abe will form a twosome for their round of golf on Saturday, presumably at the Trump International Golf Club near his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. Details are still under wraps.  Trump told a local sports radio station last weekend golf was a better way to get to know someone than lunch and saw his match-up with Abe as a \u201cfun\u201d meeting between partners rather than adversaries.  Abe might feel the occasion carries more weight. His prime minister grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, and U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower played near Washington in 1957, a round newspapers described as a \u201ctriumph of diplomacy\u201d between former World War Two enemies. Abe teed off the latest round of golf diplomacy in November, giving Trump an expensive, gold-colored driver during their meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where he sought assurances about the future strength of the decades-old alliance between the two nations. With anxiety over Trump\u2019s tough talk on currency, security and trade with Japan, some in Tokyo have expressed concern Abe might be too generous in any haggling on the fairways when pitted against the real estate mogul and author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d. In purely a golfing sense, Abe is likely to find Trump a formidable opponent. \u201cHe is pretty remarkable for a 70-year-old guy,\u201d Jaime Diaz, editor-in-chief of Golf World and a senior writer for Golf Digest, told Reuters. \u201cAs I understand it, his handicap is 2.8. That seems a little low but I think he is very capable of playing to a five or six handicap. \u201cHe is a legitimate good player. It\u2019s not a \u2018trumped-up\u2019 claim that he is somebody who shoots in the 70s.\u201d Trump says he has won 18 club trophies and said such a winning pedigree made him the ideal man to run the country during the election race. \u201cSee how beautiful my hands are, look at those hands. Those are powerful hands,\u201d Trump said at a Detroit rally last year during the Republican primaries. \u201c(They can) hit a golf ball 285 yards.\u201d Retired boxer Oscar De La Hoya questioned Trump\u2019s trustworthiness on the golf course while speaking to reporters in Las Vegas in May 2016 during the build-up to the WBC middleweight title clash between Canelo Alvarez and Amir Khan, according to the AP. Hollywood actor Samuel L. Jackson did the same in an interview he did with United Airlines\u2019 Rhapsody magazine in January 2016. Reuters could not independently confirm these accounts. After the Jackson interview, Trump issued a tweet that said in part: \u201cI don\u2019t cheat at golf.\u201d The White House did not return a request for comment on the cheating allegations.  Diaz who has twice played with Trump, at Trump National Golf Club Charlotte in North Carolina in 2013 and more recently at the Doral resort in Florida, described the President as someone who would not need to resort to cheating to beat most players. \u201cI know he has won all these club championships at golf courses that he owns and a lot of people are suspect about that. But he would be a tough guy to beat with a five handicap,\u201d the golf writer said. \u201cHe addresses the ball with good body language ... confident and flowing and fluid. He just looks like he is going to hit a good shot.\u201d It is far harder to find allegations of cheating or boastfulness directed at the more circumspect Abe, who is a member of the ultra-exclusive Three Hundred Club in Kanagawa Prefecture, south-west of Tokyo. The club, confined to only 300 members, charges some 70-80 million yen ($625,000-$715,000) for membership fees and 50,000 yen for green fees. The 62-year-old Abe takes the game very seriously and local media have reported that rounds with his wife can get tense if he is playing poorly. \u201cWhen he is playing golf, he concentrates. So everyone else becomes intense as well,\u201d a company president who plays Abe once or twice a year, told Reuters on condition of anonymity. He was unsure of Abe\u2019s handicap but confirmed reports that the Prime Minister usually shoots between 90 and 100 over 18 holes, which would place him squarely in the field of average weekend hackers. A straight driver with a \u201cstable\u201d game all round, Abe is generally smartly turned out, sometimes in short pants and knee socks and always with a baseball cap on his head. \u201cI was impressed that Abe holds the flag on the green, while other players are putting,\u201d the source said. \u201cPeople in a high position like him do not have to do that for others. He is very polite.\u201d The conservative politician is not so reserved as to shun refreshments at the \u201819th hole\u2019 back at the clubhouse, however, where he might indulge in a couple of glasses of beer or red wine after a bath to freshen up, added the source.

        "title": "Moldova ruling party chief says framed by Russia in bogus cases",
        "text": "KIEV/CHISINAU (Reuters) - The powerful head of Moldova s ruling party Vlad Plahotniuc on Thursday accused Russian authorities of harassing him and other officials with dozens of bogus legal cases, ratcheting up a long-running diplomatic row between the two countries. Plahotniuc was charged in absentia by Russian investigators this week of orchestrating the attempted murder of a banker in London in 2012, according to Russian media outlets.  Without referring to any particular case, Plahotniuc told Reuters that Russian officials had sought to frame him to put him on international law enforcement watch lists. Plahotniuc expects further retaliation after the Moldovan parliament on Thursday passed a law to prevent the dissemination of foreign  fake news,  on Russian-language and other channels. Russian security services are  falsely accusing us of ethnic, political and ideological hatred, murder, theft, virtually anything they could think of,  he said by email through a representative.   They have seen their attempts failing so far, thus, they already went on with tougher and more explicit abuses.  The Russian foreign ministry and general prosecutor s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Maria Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, at a briefing in November accused the Moldovan government and lawmakers of  some openly anti-Russian actions  and hampering attempts by Moldova s president to foster closer ties.  Nevertheless, Russia is open to long-term development of friendly, partner relations with a neutral Moldova, relations based on long-standing historical ties between our peoples,  she said.   Ex-Soviet Moldova is politically divided between a pro-Western government, which favors closer integration with the European Union, and Russian-backed President Igor Dodon.  Moldova and Russia have been embroiled in a series of spats this year.  The Chisinau government in March accused Russia s security apparatus of seeking to derail a Moldovan probe into a Russian-led money laundering operation by harassing Moldovan officials as they traveled to or through Russia. Plahotniuc said that behavior continued in recent months because of ongoing investigations into the case known locally as the  Russian Laundromat .   Russia s behavior  toward my colleagues and me is an explicit act of blackmail and political harassment.. abusive and illegal behavior, which will not change our commitment to the democratic and European development of Moldova,  he said.  The Moldovan parliament adopted a bill on Thursday aimed at combating foreign propaganda, banning television channels from airing news and analytical programs from countries that have not signed up a European broadcasting agreement, such as Russia.  Nobody is banning any channels from any particular country. This is not a question of banning channels from broadcasting, but about banning specific programs whose purpose is manipulation, propaganda and disinformation,  the author of the bill, MP Serdjiu Sirbu, told parliament. Dodon said he would refuse to sign the bill into law.   Under no circumstances will I sign a bill limiting the broadcasting of Russian TV channels in the republic. This document contradicts all the European norms of freedom of speech, as well as the constitution of Moldova,  he said.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service should resign due to the agency\u2019s inability to improve its defenses against hacks on taxpayer data, a Republican lawmaker said on Friday. Republican Representative Barbara Comstock said new leadership is needed to replace IRS Commissioner John Koskinen due to failures to secure Americans\u2019 sensitive information from malicious intrusions, escalating a line of attack from Republicans who frequently criticize the federal tax collection service. \u201cCommissioner Koskinen has provided little confidence that cyber security is a top priority at the IRS,\u201d Comstock said in a statement shared with Reuters, adding she was concerned the agency apparently has no one in charge of cyber security. The IRS did not immediately comment. More than 700,000 individuals may have had their personal information pilfered by hackers during an intrusion last year, the IRS announced in February. That number has been repeatedly revised upward from initial estimates that were far smaller. Comstock, in her statement, cited a Government Accountability Office report released last month that found the IRS struggling to upgrade its information security plan. The IRS agreed to work toward implementing dozens of outlined recommendations. Koskinen appeared before congressional committees this week and said complying with the GAO recommendations was a priority. The commissioner has been under near-constant fire from Republicans since he took over the agency in 2013 amid controversy over whether the IRS was targeting conservative groups.  More than 60 Republicans have signed on to a resolution introduced in October to impeach Koskinen on charges that he has impeded a congressional investigation into the IRS\u2019s treatment of conservative groups. Comstock is the first lawmaker to call for Koskinen\u2019s resignation solely for cyber security reasons, an aide said. Koskinen is not the first Obama administration official to be targeted by Congress for his handling of cyber security. Last year Katherine Archuleta, head of the Office of Personnel Management, resigned after several lawmakers from both parties called for her ouster following the theft of personal data of more than 21 million individuals. Comstock said Friday that Koskinen should follow the lead of Archuleta and other top executives who have left due to poor handling of hacks \u201cto allow for new and trusted leadership at the IRS.\u201d ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - A Kansas state senator on Monday declined to back down from comments comparing Planned Parenthood to Nazi concentration camps, which he made after finding out that a donation had been sent to the organization in his name. \u201cKilling people equals killing people,\u201d Republican state Senator Steve Fitzgerald said in a phone interview when asked about the comparison on Monday, referring to abortion.  \u201cPlanned Parenthood is killing more people than they did in Nazi Germany,\u201d he said.  The Nazis were responsible for the systematic killing of 6 million Jews, as well as others such as homosexuals, Roma people and political opponents during World War Two. Planned Parenthood provides abortions as well as other women\u2019s health services, including birth control and cancer screenings. It has long been a target of conservative Republicans. Fitzgerald has been in the spotlight since Planned Parenthood on Friday made public a letter from the senator in which he wrote that finding out that a donation had been made to the group in his name was \u201cas bad - or worse - as having one\u2019s name associated with Dachau.\u201d Dachau was a Nazi concentration camp estimated to have been the site of nearly 32,000 killings.  In his letter, Fitzgerald castigated the organization and the donor, Kansas City, Missouri, resident Ali Weinel, calling the move an attempt to \u201cblacken\u201d his name by associating him with a \u201cheinous\u201d group. Weinel said Monday that she made the donation in the senator\u2019s name about a month ago after a contentious email exchange with Fitzgerald, in which he expressed disgust over her views on abortion. \u201cI was so frustrated by the email exchange that the only thing I could think to do was to donate to Planned Parenthood in his honor,\u201d Weinel said. Making donations to the organization in the name of conservative elected officials has become a tactic among some on the left as a way to make a political statement. Planned Parenthood Great Plains spokeswoman Bonyen Lee-Gilmore called Fitzgerald\u2019s concentration camp comparison inflammatory. \u201cWe obviously condemn this extreme ideology,\u201d Lee-Gilmore said in a telephone interview on Monday. Lee-Gilmore said that after receiving Weinel\u2019s donation, the organization had last month sent Fitzgerald a form letter, which his Friday letter was apparently a response to. Fitzgerald called the events political theater on the part of Planned Parenthood.  \u201cThe letter they sent me was strictly a poke in the eye,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cAnd I responded to it.\u201d ",

        "title": "U.S. farm heartland lobbies to steer Trump away from Mexico trade war",
        "text": "GARNER, Iowa/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Farmers in the U.S. agricultural heartland that helped elect Donald Trump are now pushing his administration to avoid a trade dispute with Mexico, fearing retaliatory tariffs that could hit over $3 billion in U.S. exports. The value of exports at risk is based on a Reuters analysis of a tariff list which Mexico used in a trucking dispute six years ago and which Mexican officials have said could serve as a model if President Trump sets new barriers to Mexican goods.      Pork producers contacted Trump\u2019s transition team soon after the Nov. 8 election to stress that tariff-free access to Mexico has made it their top export market by volume, said John Weber, president of the National Pork Producers Council. The council has sent the administration multiple letters, including one signed in January by 133 agricultural organizations, and is arranging for several hog farmers to fly to Washington next month to talk to officials. \u201cWe just keep pounding them on how critical trade is to us,\u201d said Weber, who fears Mexico could revive the list of mostly agricultural products it successfully used to push Washington into letting Mexican truckers on U.S. highways in 2011.  Pork products topped that list and, if revived, the tariffs would apply to over $800 million of annual pork exports, according to data compiled by IHS Markit\u2019s Global Trade Atlas. \u201cWe\u2019ll be the first to take the hit,\u201d Weber said.  The lobbying effort by U.S. businesses which rely on the Mexican market shows how Mexico can press its case in Washington despite having an economy 1/17 the size of America\u2019s and relying on the U.S. market for nearly 80 percent if its exports. In Iowa, where pigs outnumber people seven to one, hog and grain farmer Jamie Schmidt voted for Trump in part on his promise to cut regulatory burdens for businesses. Now he and others who farm the flat, rich land around Garner, Iowa, worry about trade. Schmidt gets about half of his income from hogs, earning $4-5 for each of the 425 pigs he sells per week, usually to a Tyson Foods (TSN.N) packing plant in nearby Perry, Iowa.  Tariffs from Mexico could depress U.S. wholesale prices and wipe out his profits, Schmidt said. \u201cIt would be devastating.\u201d  In December, after fears of a trade dispute fueled a deep peso MXN= slump, Mexico started mapping out U.S. states that are most reliant on its market, replicating the strategy it used in the trucking dispute, said two senior Mexican officials. Mexican officials also prepared briefs, seen by Reuters, on Mexico\u2019s own risks in a dispute, including losing much of its cost advantage in building cars, such as the Ford Fusion (F.N) made in Hermosillo, Mexico.  Reuters could not verify a complete list of products and states Mexico considered targeting this time around. But the country\u2019s foreign minister said last month tariffs could target Iowa, which raises a third of U.S. hogs and exports about a quarter of its pork production, $100 million of which went to Mexico last year. The minister also said tariffs could aim at Wisconsin, the center of U.S. cheese production, and has singled out Texas for its \u201cnotable\u201d trade surplus with Mexico. All three states voted for Trump in the 2016 election, with the president taking Iowa and Wisconsin by slim margins. Trump has accused Mexico of destroying U.S. jobs and has vowed to leave the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico if he cannot renegotiate better terms with Mexico. United States went from running a small trade surplus with Mexico in the early 1990s to a $63 billion deficit in 2016. Besides pork, cheese was also a top target in the trucking dispute in which Mexico retaliated with tariffs against rules that banned its trucks from U.S. roads. Some $200 million in current annual exports of cheese would be targeted if the tariff list were revived, according to the IHS database, which the U.S. government uses to measure the impact of trade disputes. The full tariff list would apply to $3.25 billion in current U.S. exports. John Holevoet, the director of government affairs at Wisconsin\u2019s Dairy Business Association, said he has attended multiple meetings with Wisconsin federal lawmakers this year where risks of Mexican trade were discussed. Weber of the pork producers group said he believed the Trump administration \u201cgets it\u201d when it comes to the vulnerability of U.S. farm exports. Republican Congressman Steve King, who represents Iowa\u2019s agriculture-focused fourth district, also pointed out that Iowa\u2019s role as the first state to hold presidential primaries helps keep farm interests in Washington\u2019s view. But King told Reuters he was worried the White House is still not taking trade risks seriously enough.  A possible 20 percent tax on Mexican imports, which White House spokesman Sean Spicer has said could also pay for Trump\u2019s proposed border wall, would cause a trade war, he said. King said he has been in contact with the White House on the matter but has yet to secure a one-on-one meeting with the president. \u201cI\u2019m making sure that here in Washington they know what this means.\u201d  ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Highlights for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration on Thursday: The United States drops a massive GBU-43 bomb, the largest non-nuclear bomb it has ever used in combat, in Afghanistan against a series of caves used by Islamic State militants, the Pentagon says. Trump says Pyongyang is a problem that \u201cwill be taken care of\u201d amid speculation that North Korea is on the verge of a sixth nuclear test. Military force cannot resolve tension over North Korea, China warns, while an influential Chinese newspaper urges Pyongyang to halt its nuclear program in exchange for Beijing\u2019s protection. The Trump administration is focusing its North Korea strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang, U.S. officials say. Trump says \u201cthings will work out fine\u201d between the United States and Russia, a day after declaring U.S.-Russian relations may be at an all-time low. Trump signals he could be moving closer to the mainstream on monetary policy, saying he has not ruled out reappointment of Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair as he considers his choices for the U.S. central bank. [nL1N1HL14B] Trump signs a resolution that will allow U.S. states to restrict how federal funds for contraception and reproductive health are spent, a move cheered by anti-abortion campaigners. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen presses Deutsche Bank to release information about issues including Trump\u2019s debt and any bank meetings with Trump administration officials, saying he has \u201cgreat concern\u201d about possible conflicts of interest. EXPORT-IMPORT BANK Trump\u2019s office says he plans to revive the hobbled Export-Import Bank of the United States, a victory for American manufacturers such as Boeing Co and General Electric Co that have overseas customers that use the agency\u2019s government-backed loans to purchase their products. Top Wall Street bankers say they are having positive discussions about financial regulation in Washington, and downplay the idea U.S. policymakers may force their institutions to split up. The United States is pushing for trade to be a key issue in top-level economic talks with Japan, a source says, an unwelcome development for Tokyo, which is seeking to fend off U.S. pressure to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance. Trump\u2019s administration has focused on one group of illegal immigrants more than others: women with children, according to eight Department of Homeland Security officials interviewed by Reuters about agency planning.

        "title": "Run or wait? Tokyo's Koike faces dilemma ahead of Oct. 22 poll",
        "text": "TOKYO - Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has made no secret of her desire to be Japan s first female prime minister - she even named her pet terrier  Sori , Japanese for  premier . But Koike, 65, whose fledgling Party of Hope poses a growing threat to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s ruling bloc in an election this month, faces a tough choice: run now for a seat in parliament to become eligible for the top job, or wait and bet her party positions itself to win the next national poll. Abe called the Oct. 22 poll in hopes his Liberal Democratic Party-led bloc could keep its majority in the lower house, where it now holds a two-thirds  super majority , but Koike s party has upended forecasts.  If Koike resigns as governor little more than a year after defying Abe s LDP to run successfully for that post, she would risk a backlash from voters. Waiting might let her best shot at the premiership slip through her fingers.  If she thinks of the nation, it is important that she boldly announce her candidacy, present her ideas about important matters ... and debate policies head on,  Abe s ally, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, told reporters on Monday. Koike, a media-savvy former LDP member and defense minister, has said she would not resign as governor to run now, especially ahead of the 2020 Olympic Games, which Tokyo will host. But her carefully phrased remarks have failed to kill speculation that she will run. Candidates must register on Oct. 10, when the campaign officially starts. Koike is certain to be watching opinion polls as she weighs her decision.  A TV Asahi survey published on Monday showed 72 percent of respondents were negative about her potential candidacy. A separate NHK poll showed that support for Abe dropped seven points to 37 percent. Voters were split on Koike s new party, with about 47 percent having hopes for it, versus the same percentage with little or no expectations. Further complicating the outlook, Yukio Edano, an executive  of the failed opposition Democratic Party -  which last week decided to run no candidates of its own and have members run on the Party of Hope ticket - announced on Monday the formation of a new Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan with fellow liberals. It was not essential that Koike run this time around, her close ally, Masaru Wakasa, said on Sunday.   If there is a firm prospect of a change in government, party chief Koike might run for parliament, but if we can achieve a change in the  next, next  election, she doesn t have to run now,  Wakasa said during a debate on NHK. Koike, however, has already once blindsided Wakasa, who led   efforts to form the new party, by announcing, on the day Abe called the snap poll, that she would lead the Party of Hope herself, not entrust it to allies. On Monday, she told Jiji news agency her party aimed to run more than the 233 candidates needed to take a majority in the 465-seat lower house.  If you don t buy a lottery ticket, you can t win,  she said. But she again denied she would seek a seat in parliament now.  I was in national politics for 24 years and I have no intention to go back to a place where you can achieve nothing despite spending so much time,  she said. A former TV announcer who speaks Arabic and English and peppers her speeches with foreign words, Koike wants to build a  pro-reform, conservative  party to compete with the LDP, in part by cannibalizing the failed main opposition Democratic Party and luring smaller parties to her side. Her cool, polished demeanor belies a steeliness beneath.  She can take a punch with a smile and sharpen her knives at the same time,  said Jesper Koll, head of equity fund Wisdom Tree, who has followed Japanese politics for years. Like former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, one of her past mentors, Koike promises to  break free of vested interests , a slogan that resonates with voters looking for an alternative to the LDP - although critics question just how different that alternative would be from Abe s LDP. To differentiate her party from the LDP, Koike has adopted popular policies, such as an end to atomic power amid public safety worries after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis, and proposes to freeze a planned sales tax hike from 2019. But she also backs Abe s push to expand the role of the military overseas and his goal of revising the post-war constitution - although recently she has avoided focusing on the divisive issue of amending its pacifist Article 9. She has also said in the past that Japan should consider having nuclear weapons, breaking a taboo in the only country to suffer an atomic attack, and, like Abe, has visited the Yasukuni Shrine for war dead, seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Japan s past militarism. Koike entered politics in a small reformist party and migrated through several other groups before joining the LDP and in 2008 became the first woman to run for head of the conservative party. She came in a distant third. ",

        "title": "Mattis plays down split between Trump, Tillerson on North Korea",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Tuesday played down an apparent split between the U.S. president and his top diplomat over outreach to North Korea, saying America s focus was still on finding a diplomatic solution to the dispute with Pyongyang. President Donald Trump, who has traded insults and threats with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in recent weeks, said on Sunday Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was  wasting his time  trying to negotiate with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program. Tillerson, during a trip to China on Saturday, said the United States had direct channels of communication with the North and was probing Pyongyang to see if it was interested in dialogue. He expressed hope for reducing tensions with North Korea, which is fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.  I do not see the divergence as strongly as some ... have interpreted it,  Mattis said. Both Mattis and Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, broadly backed Tillerson s efforts as they testified at the hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.  President Trump s guidance to both Secretary Tillerson and me has been very clearly that we would ... pursue the diplomatic effort to include with the various initiatives with China,  Mattis told a Senate hearing.  I believe that Secretary Tillerson is accurately stating that we are probing for opportunities to talk with the North. All we re doing is probing. We re not talking with them, consistent with the president s dismay about not talking with them before the time is right.  Trump has vowed to halt North Korea s nuclear ambitions and tensions have escalated in recent months, with Pyongyang conducting its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3. It has also threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific. Dunford, the top U.S. military officer, strongly backed Tillerson s efforts to tighten an economic squeeze on North Korea. The international community s sanctions will need to be strong enough to convince Kim he cannot survive in power unless he changes course, he said. Dunford said Kim sees possession of ballistic missiles and a nuclear capability as inextricably linked to regime survival, adding:  What I think Kim Jong Un needs to realize is that he cannot survive with ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons because the international community will not allow him to survive.  Dunford said Kim was particularly sensitive to the flow of oil into North Korea, saying when there has been a cut-off in the past  there s been a change in Kim Jong Un s behavior.   The fact is he needs economic resources external to the country to survive,  he said. U.S. Senator Jack Reed questioned whether some degree of communication was vital between Washington and Pyongyang, given the risks of miscalculation by either side that could lead to conflict. Mattis suggested that the Trump administration was exploring a host of ways to influence the North, including through diplomacy.  I think the president dispatching Secretary Tillerson to Beijing here within the past several days to carry messages and to look at the way we can work with them is the most accurate answer to your question, that in fact this is part of a whole ... integrated effort that we have underway right now,  Mattis said. It was not the first time the White House and State Department have seemed at odds on policy issues, but the White House has said Trump still had confidence in Tillerson. Trump has vowed to halt North Korea s nuclear ambitions and tensions have escalated in recent months, with Pyongyang conducting its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3. It has also threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific. The fate of Americans held in North Korea is also a bone of contention. The Trump administration has demanded North Korea release three U.S. citizens it has detained: missionary Kim Dong Chul and academics Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song. The Trump White House and State Department have taken divergent stances on other foreign policy issues. When a dispute over Qatar erupted this year, Trump strongly backed Gulf Arab leaders who accuse Qatar of supporting Iran as well as Islamist militants.  Trump accused Qatar of being a  high-level  funder of terrorism even as the Pentagon and Tillerson cautioned against the military, commercial and humanitarian effects of a boycott imposed by Arab states. Months into the dispute, Trump adopted a position more in line with that of the State Department. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter is scheduled to preview the Pentagon\u2019s fiscal 2017 budget request in a speech on Feb. 2, a week before the White House sends its budget plans to Congress, two U.S. defense officials said on Monday. Carter is expected to highlight the broad themes of the Pentagon\u2019s budget request and its priorities, rather than presenting a detailed list of programmatic changes, said one of the sources, who was not authorized to speak publicly. A massive government spending bill enacted by Congress last year set a spending level of about $576 billion for the Pentagon in fiscal 2017, which meant the Defense Department had to trim its planned funding levels by about $15 billion. The White House earlier this month said it plans to release President Barack Obama\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2017, which begins on Oct. 1, on Feb. 9. Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), maker of the F-35 fighter jet, Boeing Co (BA.N) and other big weapons makers are anxiously awaiting details about the budget and how it will affect their programs.  Senior defense officials have said that the $15 billion in cuts would largely come from procurement accounts since personnel costs and operations costs were harder to cut. Defense Undersecretary Frank Kendall, the military\u2019s chief weapons buyer, told reporters last month that the Pentagon\u2019s fiscal 2017 budget plan may slow production of key weapons programs, including the F-35 fighter jet.

        "title": "Northern Ireland fears Brexit loss of EU peacemaking and cash",
        "text": "BELFAST (Reuters) - The European Union has long aided efforts to heal the deep divisions that plague Northern Ireland, and many people on both sides of the sectarian rift fear what might happen when Brexit forces it to walk away.  Since a 1998 peace deal ended three decades of violence between Protestant pro-British unionists and Catholic Irish nationalists, in which 3,600 died, the EU has pumped about 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) into projects to shore up that peace - more than any other body apart from the British state. It has enjoyed broad support and influence as a force viewed by both sides as a neutral broker separate from the British government, which is distrusted by many nationalists, and the Irish government, distrusted by many unionists. It has been able to take on projects others shy away from, such as the reintegration of former militants, both IRA and pro-union loyalists, and support for relatives of dead fighters.      Brexit is already rattling the region by raising concerns it will lead to a hard border with EU member Ireland. For some in both communities, the idea of a new, rigid frontier stirs painful memories of the British Army watchtowers and checkpoints that peppered the border during the decades of bloodshed.  It s a very fragile situation here, and in Westminster there seems to be a lack of consideration for Northern Ireland,  said Kate Clifford, director of the Rural Community Network, a community group that has received peace funding in the past.  Without a (EU) peace program behind that, without the impetus of the external force that is Europe, that honest broker, things will become very difficult,  she said.   While no one expects a return to the widespread violence of Northern Ireland s  Troubles  of the 1960s to 1990s, sectarian tensions still run high and intermittingly erupt into rioting.   Some British ministers argue that savings from leaving the bloc would allow the government to match all EU funding and last month British Prime Minister Theresa May said that her government would consider replacing that European money.  Yet London has offered no guarantees and, with Brexit negotiations between London and Brussels in their infancy, there is little certainty about how leaving the bloc will affect Britain s finances.   The British government s Northern Ireland office and the EU s Belfast office declined to comment. Since the EU s Northern Ireland PEACE program was founded in 1995, funded groups have worked with hundreds of thousands of Northern Ireland s 1.8 million citizens on conflict resolution, anti-sectarianism and supporting victims.  By the end of its latest funding drive, it will have pumped in 1.5 billion euros. This makes it by far the largest funder of organizations working on peace projects outside the British government, which has provided several billion euros worth of funds to the sector but does not provide a single figure for its investment.  For many such groups, the EU represents their largest single source of funds.  The EU has separately funded major infrastructure projects to the tune of billions of euros, including the 250-metre pedestrian bridge that links the mainly Protestant and Catholic sides of the River Foyle at Londonderry, the city where many see  The Troubles  of having first exploded in 1969.  While critics have at times questioned whether the bloc has spread its resources too thinly, its role is widely acknowledged as transformative for the region, particularly funding groups that have worked with thousands of former fighters and relatives of militants who died in the conflict.    A lot of energy was put in to supporting the process whereby these groups which were previously killing each other were working together,  said Avila Kilmurray, who managed EU PEACE funding for the reintegration of prisoners from the conflict from 1994-2014, as director of the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland.   The danger is that if there is that hiatus in terms of funding that makes it (the cooperation) much more difficult to actually maintain.   Many community workers voiced scepticism that Northern Ireland, already one of the British regions receiving the highest level of taxpayers  money, will remain a priority for the British government in the upheaval of Brexit.   In this work, I have met no one who actually believes that the Tory government care enough  to match the funding, said Kieran McEvoy, a professor at Queen s University Belfast s Institute of Conflict Transformation. At Belfast s most notorious flashpoint area - the streets between the fiercely loyalist Shankill Road and the nationalist Falls Road - former militants from both sides now work together.  Some bring children from both communities on joint holidays and contact each other during street trouble to try to calm the situation when matters start to get out of control. EU funding has been  absolutely critical  for projects that involve ex-militants, said Seanna Breathnach, a former IRA member. He works for the Coiste, which helps former fighters reintegrate into society and get jobs after leaving prison.   Activists say former prisoners have been able to influence the kind of young men who might be tempted to join dissident militants opposed to the peace deal.   The key is that young people are not sucked in - that we stop the glamorizing of violence that some people do,  Breathnach said.  Post-Brexit, activists say they will be faced with two main problems: convincing the British political establishment that Northern Ireland still needs a disproportionate level of state spending two decades after the peace; and to ensure Northern Irish politicians don t shy away from difficult projects. Kenny Donaldson is director of the South East Fermanagh Foundation, a support group for victims of militancy which gets 40-50 percent of its funding from the EU.  His fear, he said, was that many in the British political establishment did not appreciate how fragile Northern Ireland remained, with communities still harboring deep distrust of each other  We have to make that step from coexistence in isolation to meaningful integration,  he said.  While you only have coexistence you are too close to violence.   ",

        "title": "Philippine president sees biggest ratings dip, but popularity intact",
        "text": "MANILA (Reuters) - Trust and satisfaction in Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte fell to the lowest of his presidency in the third quarter of this year, a survey showed on Sunday, although sentiment about his leadership remained positive overall. Net satisfaction, used by pollster Social Weather Stations (SWS) as a rating of the president s performance, was down 18 points from the second quarter to 48, classified as  good  in the survey of 1,200 Filipinos conducted in the last week of September.  Duterte s net trust rating, which gauges public sentiment about his personality, was  very good  at 60 points, down from  excellent  75 he achieved in the previous poll. The survey was conducted just a few days after thousands of Filipinos rallied to denounce Duterte, his anti-drug crackdown and what they called an emerging dictatorship. Thousands of Filipinos have been killed in the crackdown and other SWS polls conducted in September indicated doubts about the validity of official accounts of the 3,800 cases where police killed drug suspects. The SWS survey did not ask respondents to give a reason for the rating of Duterte, who took office in June 2016. Duterte s spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the survey results. Political analyst Ramon Casiple, head of the country s Institute for Political and Electoral Reform, said it was normal for a president s rating to fall during his time in office, but concern over the high death toll in his signature war on drugs will have weighed on sentiment. Activists accuse Duterte of inciting police to kill drug dealers and users, which he denies. Police reject allegations they are executing suspects and say deaths occurred because victims had violently resisted arrest. Casiple said that though the poll still showed Duterte had the support of Filipinos, he should take it seriously.  This is a real diminution of his popularity and it serves as a wakeup call for him to stop it further going down,  Casiple said of the poll.  However, this is still a comfortable figure and far from the threshold of unpopularity.  Based on SWS methodology for net trust ratings, a score of 70 and above is considered excellent, 50 to 69 is very good, 30-49 good and 10-29 moderate. While his political opponents chide him for his authoritarian style and intolerance of dissent, Duterte enjoys a cult-like following and support from millions of Filipinos, who see him as the best hope for change in a country with rampant crime and a yawning gap between rich and poor.

        "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. military said on Saturday it has opened an investigation into fake mobile phone alerts and social media messages advising U.S. military personnel and their families to evacuate the Korean Peninsula.   The phony messages, which were spread on Thursday, came at a sensitive time, with tensions high after North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3.  The test and a series of missile launches have triggered a war of words between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea s leader Kim Jong Un.  U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) was not yet aware of how many people received the hoax messages or who was behind them, a spokesman for the USFK told Reuters.  The USFK posted a statement on its official Facebook page on Thursday making clear that the U.S. military did not issue any evacuation-related alerts.  It has also instructed all U.S. Department of Defense personnel and their family to confirm any evacuation-related communications before acting.   The USFK conducts regular biannual noncombatant evacuation operation (NEO) exercises in the spring and fall to rehearse for possible evacuation. The second NEO exercise of the year is scheduled to take place in October.  ",

        "title": "Former Ku Klux Klan leader Duke runs for U.S. Senate in Louisiana",
        "text": "BATON ROUGE, La. (Reuters) - David Duke, a former leader of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan, launched his candidacy on Friday for the U.S. Senate from Louisiana, saying white people are threatened in America and that he hears echoes of his views in Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric. Duke, a Republican, is a former Louisiana state legislator and unsuccessful candidate for governor who served a 15-month federal prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2002 to felony charges of tax evasion and mail fraud. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, drew criticism in February for failing to quickly disavow support from Duke. At a news conference in Baton Rouge after officially filing as a candidate to succeed outgoing Republican Senator David Vitter, Duke, 66, said he watched Trump\u2019s speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday in Cleveland and heard echoes of his own past political platforms. \u201cI don\u2019t really care what Donald Trump says about me. I respect what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Duke said. In an online video announcing his candidacy, Duke also said, \u201cI\u2019m overjoyed to see Donald Trump and most Americans embrace most of the issues that I\u2019ve championed for years.\u201d In his video, Duke said he believes in equal rights and respect for all Americans but \u201cwhat makes me different is I also demand respect for the rights and heritage of European-Americans.\u201d Duke\u2019s announcement came as Louisiana\u2019s capital grapples with racial tensions after the fatal July 5 shooting by police of a black man named Alton Sterling and the July 17 shooting deaths of three police officers by a black U.S. Marine Corps veteran. In his comments to reporters, Duke called the Black Lives Matter protest movement that arose after a series of killings of black men by police in various U.S. cities a \u201cterrorist group.\u201d Duke said that \u201cEuropean-Americans\u201d need a politician to fight for their interests and that white people are threatened in the United States. Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, said he was no longer affiliated with the group. \u2018HATE-FILLED FRAUD\u2019 Duke\u2019s announcement drew and swift and scathing condemnation from Republican leaders and others. The Republican Party of Louisiana called Duke a \u201cfelon and hate-filled fraud\u201d who does not embody Republican values. Ward Baker, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which supports Republican candidates in Senate races, said Duke will never get the organization\u2019s backing. Louisiana does not hold party primaries. Instead, candidates from all parties are placed on the same ballot. If no one wins a simple majority in the Nov. 8 election, the top two vote-getters enter a runoff. Duke used this system to his advantage when he ran for governor in 1991 and made it to a runoff against former Governor Edwin Edwards, who had left office under a cloud of controversy for misconduct in office. Other candidates seeking to replace Vitter in the Senate include Republican U.S. congressmen Charles Boustany and John Fleming. Vitter did not seek re-election to the Senate after a prostitution scandal helped derail his bid to become Louisiana governor. \u201cI strongly denounce the racism, bigotry and anti-Semitism of David Duke. His views are a relic of ancient history and are repugnant to Louisianians,\u201d Boustany said.  A spokesman for Fleming said the congressman \u201cis wholly focused on uniting Louisiana voters of all races, creeds and religions.\u201d  In February, Trump initially blamed his failure to reject Duke\u2019s support on not having heard an interviewer clearly.  \u201cI disavowed David Duke all weekend long, on\u00a0Facebook, on\u00a0Twitter, and obviously, it is never enough,\u201d Trump told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show after being widely criticized.

        "title": "Clinton's embrace of Obama holds risks for general election matchup",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton has distanced herself from President Barack Obama on a number of high-profile issues since starting her bid for the White House. Now, under pressure from left-leaning challenger Bernie Sanders, she is embracing him and his legacy with fervor. That strategy could pose problems for Clinton in the long run as Republicans look for fodder to portray her as representing Obama\u2019s third term should she win the Democratic nomination. As she faces an unexpected challenge from Sanders in the early voting states, Clinton\u2019s move to portray herself as an heir to Obama\u2019s policies is aimed at courting young voters and progressives who are part of the president\u2019s political base.  But she could be setting herself up for difficulties with a general electorate weary of the status quo. Over and over again during a tense Democratic presidential debate on Sunday, Clinton, who served as Obama\u2019s secretary of state for four years, played up her ties to the president and accused Sanders of undermining him. Gone were her mentions of differences with the president over Syria, trade, and immigration. Instead, Clinton praised the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law. She highlighted her connection to the administration\u2019s Iran nuclear deal and lauded the White House for sending staff to Silicon Valley to discuss cybersecurity. Clinton, who ran against Obama for the 2008 Democratic nomination and then joined his administration, said she could accept Sanders\u2019 criticism of her campaign donations - one of the Vermont senator\u2019s favorite critiques - but wouldn\u2019t tolerate similar criticism targeted at her former boss. \u201cThe comments that Senator Sanders has made ... don\u2019t just affect me, I can take that, but he\u2019s criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street. And President Obama has led our country out of the Great Recession,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry, and getting results.\u201d Clinton played up her service as his top diplomat, emphasized her hours advising him in the Situation Room, and accused Sanders of wanting to throw out Obamacare, all while debating in South Carolina, a state in which Obama is well liked. Republicans welcomed the opening Clinton provided for them to cast her White House run as a bid for a third Obama term. \u201cWhen you have a president who is so unpopular as President Barack Obama ... and his chief diplomat is embracing those policies and running as his third term, it\u2019s going to be next to impossible,\u201d said Ric Grenell, a former U.S. spokesman at the United Nations under Republican President George W. Bush.  Dissatisfaction with Obama and the agenda in Washington have helped propel two candidates outside the Republican establishment - businessman Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas - to the top of the party\u2019s crowded presidential field. Trump appeared to reference Clinton\u2019s comments about the president\u2019s policies in a speech at Liberty University on Monday, saying the country cannot afford another four years of the same thing. \u201cWe can\u2019t have another four years of Barack Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have another four years of Hillary Clinton.\u201d Perhaps foreshadowing future ads, the Republican National Committee noted that Democrats at Sunday\u2019s debate had backed the current occupant of the White House. \u201cNot content with Barack Obama\u2019s legacy of a toxic Iran deal and the rise of ISIS in the Middle East, Democrats doubled down on the extreme and failed policies of the current administration,\u201d the RNC said in a statement. Democrats said Clinton was embracing Obama because he is popular with the party\u2019s base, including in Iowa, which holds the first nominating contest, called a caucus, on Feb. 1. \u201cIt just makes sense to highlight where you agree with a president who is popular among caucus goers, and Secretary Clinton found ways to get that done,\u201d said Brent Colburn, a former Obama administration official who served as communications director for his 2012 campaign. Democratic strategist Richard Socarides, a Clinton supporter, said Republicans were bound to portray her potential presidency as a third Obama term anyway.  \u201cShe deserves a lot of credit for putting the country first and going to work for him,\u201d Socarides said. \u201cAfter Iowa and New Hampshire especially, that will matter to a lot of Democratic primary voters. And she is right to point out that Bernie has not always been there. She has.\u201d      (Additional reporting by Alana Wise and Sarah N.

Ingabire was jailed for 15 years in 2012 for conspiring to form an armed group to undermine the government and for seeking to minimize the 1994 genocide. Among the seven people arrested was Boniface Twagirimana, the vice president of Ingabire s party, and Leonille Gasengayire, a member of the party - FDU-Inkingi - which has never been registered as an official political movement, the police said on Wednesday.  Both have in the past accused the government of killing or being behind the disappearance of party members, which the government denies. Ingabire returned from exile in the Netherlands to contest a presidential election in January 2010 but was barred from standing after being accused of genocide denial. More than 800,000 people were killed in Rwanda when an ethnic Hutu-led government and ethnic militias went on a 100-day massacre. Afterwards, President Paul Kagame, who won a third term last month, was lauded for bringing economic improvements but he has faced increasing accusations of widespread human rights abuses, suppression of the political opposition and muzzling the media.

Security Council resolution imposing tougher sanctions and said the United States would soon face the  greatest pain  it had ever experienced. The Security Council unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea on Monday over the country s sixth and most powerful nuclear test, imposing a ban on its textile exports and capping imports of crude oil.  My delegation condemns in the strongest terms and categorically rejects the latest illegal and unlawful U.N.

        "title": "Italy's main parties back election law that isolates 5-Star",
        "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italy s traditional political parties have pledged to back a new electoral law this week that is seen penalizing the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement ahead of next year s national election. The lower house of parliament is due to start voting on Tuesday on an electoral law supported by the country s main right- and left-wing parties. Unlike the current system, it would allow the formation of broad coalitions before a vote, a factor likely to hurt 5-Star, which refuses to join alliances.  The only aim (of the law) is to allow others to gang up on us,  5-Star lawmaker Danilo Toninelli said on Sunday, a day after a parliamentary committee signed off on the new proposal. For the traditional parties,  the important thing is to stop the 5-Star,  he said. A national vote is due to be held during the first half of 2018, between March and May. Polls show Matteo Renzi s ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD), which proposed the new law, is neck-in-neck with the 5-Star. But if the PD runs in alliance with smaller centrist and left-wing parties, together they would likely surpass the 5-Star, now led by the 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio. The new law may be even more beneficial to Silvio Berlusconi s center-right Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party and the far-right Northern League, which also back the bill. In a coalition, polls show they could win the most votes.  The wind is blowing in the sails of the center-right and of Forza Italia,  the lower-house speaker of Berlusconi s party, Renato Brunetta, said.  But polls give neither Renzi s center-left or Berlusconi s center-right enough votes to govern alone, suggesting a right-left alliance may be the only way to form a government after the election.  The bill could pass as early as this week in the Chamber, after which it would go to the Senate for approval. The risk is that it could be sunk by dozens of secret votes in which parliamentarians can break with the official party line. Secret voting is what killed a previous election law proposal in June that initially had been supported by the 5-Star Movement. The 5-Star catapulted into parliament in 2013 with nearly a quarter of the national vote, but it has struggled to further expand its support. It has vowed to rescue Italy from the clutches of what it says is a corrupt political system.  Five-Star s policies include the introduction of universal income support for the poor, rewriting European Union public spending limits, and phasing out fossil fuels. It now says holding a referendum whether to dump the euro, which had been a pillar of its platform, is not a priority. The proposed election law would distribute almost two-thirds of the seats in parliament on a proportional basis, while a third would be decided in a first-past-the-post vote on specific candidates. Coalitions would need to get 10 percent of the national vote to get into parliament, while parties running alone would need only 3 percent. Candidates would be chosen by party chiefs. ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Monday confirmed William Emanuel, a veteran  management-side labor lawyer, to the National Labor Relations Board, giving the agency a Republican majority widely expected to roll back recent decisions that business groups have said favored unions. Emanuel, a partner with global labor-law firm Littler Mendelson, was confirmed 49-47 by the Republican-controlled Senate. President Donald Trump nominated Emanuel and Marvin Kaplan, a lawyer and former Republican congressional aide, to the board earlier this year. Kaplan was confirmed in August. The NLRB oversees union elections and disputes between private-sector employers, workers and unions.  Republicans will now have a 3-2 edge on the board. Business groups and many Republicans lawmakers have called on the agency to revisit significant changes to labor policy adopted during the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama. They include rules designed to speed up the union election process and a 2015 decision that made it easier for companies to be found to be joint employers and held liable for legal violations by contractors, staffing agencies and franchisees. Emanuel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Before the vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  said that during the Obama administration, the board strayed from its role as \u201ca neutral umpire in labor disputes.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time to get back to that important original mission,\u201d he said. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said, however, that  Emanuel should not join the NLRB after spending 40 years trying to prevent workers from organizing. Emanuel has worked with Republicans in Congress and trade groups including the National Retail Federation and National Association of Manufacturers, and has defended employers for decades in NLRB cases.  He is a member of the conservative Federalist Society, an influential group of lawyers credited with pushing Trump to nominate Neil Gorsuch to U.S. Supreme Court. At a Senate confirmation hearing in August, several Democrats questioned whether Emanuel would properly consider workers\u2019 collective bargaining rights after long representing employers and trade groups.  He said he would be \u201chonest and objective\u201d as a board member, and noted that it would be unusual for a labor lawyer to have experience representing both unions and management. ",

        "text": "PALORINYA, Uganda (Reuters) - Oliver Wani found sanctuary from South Sudan s civil war in a Ugandan refugee camp. But when the food ran out, he returned home only to be killed in the conflict he had fled. The 45-year-old farmer was one of more than a million South Sudanese living in sprawling camps just across the border in northern Uganda, seeking refuge from the four-year war that has devastated their homeland.  But funding gaps and organizational problems often delay or reduce their meager rations, driving some desperate families back to the lands they fled and underscoring the struggle to cope with Africa s biggest refugee crisis in two decades. Refugees from South Sudan have been arriving in Uganda at an average rate of 35,000 a month this year. The Bidi Bidi camp was home to 285,000 people at the end of September, according to the U.N. s refugee agency, making it the biggest in Africa. The U.N. agency (UNHCR) said funding had only covered 32 percent of $674 million requested to help refugees in Uganda in 2017 and the U.N. s World Food Programme (WFP) said it was facing a $71 million shortfall for the next six months. Wani, who cared for his elderly parents, received no food in October because distributions had been delayed, his father Timon said. The memory of the crops Oliver had left behind proved too tempting and he returned to South Sudan to find food. Two weeks later, other returning refugees recognized his remains alongside another dead refugee on a forest path in South Sudan, where the ground was littered with bullet casings.  He went back to look for food,  said Timon, a tall, thin man who wiped away tears with his handkerchief as he spoke at a memorial service for his first-born child in the Palorinya refugee camp.  I m heartbroken.  The four-year war in oil-rich South Sudan, a country only founded in 2011, has forced more than a third of its 12 million citizens to flee their homes. Tens of thousands have died, some in ethnic killings, others from starvation and disease. Palorinya is the second biggest camp in northern Uganda after Bidi Bidi and alone houses 185,000 refugees.  Each refugee is supposed to get 12 kg of grain, 6 kg of dry beans, cooking oil and salt each month, but the U.N. s WFP said this was delayed in October because grain was scarce in Uganda and the roads to Palorinya were bad.  Food distributions did not start camp until Oct. 26, WFP said. It takes two weeks to complete a distribution, so tens of thousands of refugees did not get any food that month. Desperate, some returned to the war zone. At least eight refugees from Palorinya were killed in South Sudan after returning to look for food in October, according to family members and the Anglican church, which tracks civilian deaths.  In August and September, when rations were distributed normally, just two refugees from the camp were killed when they returned to find food, the church diocese in South Sudan s volatile Kajo Keji region said. Modi Scopas John, chairman of a Refugee Welfare Committee in Palorinya, said refugees were returning home every day.  If you have nothing to eat, what do you do?  he asked, perched on a plastic chair under a spindly tree.  You have to look for food.  Wani was killed in Kajo Keji, where the government and two rebel groups are battling for control in a war sparked by a feud between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar. Next to Wani lay the body of Yassin Mori, 35, who had also left Palorinya to look for food, according to Mori s two brothers who ventured into South Sudan to look for him.  Mori left two wives and nine children behind.  Now we need support because we are left with his children and widows,  Taha Igga, one of the brothers, said at a memorial service in the Ugandan refugee camp.     Mutabazi Caleb, from aid group World Vision, which runs the distributions, said that Palorinya is two months behind other camps in its food distributions. WFP said it had substituted half the cereal ration with money in September in some other camps so refugees could buy food and was expanding its infrastructure to prevent future delays.  But refugees said even when food arrives, it doesn t last a month. Of the 12 kg of grain, refugees said they sell one to pay for grinding the rest into flour, and another to buy soap, which is in short supply. They also complained that the beans were sometimes inedible.  They are not okay, others are rotten, and they are smelling,  said mother-of-four Liong Viola, 32, picking through her sack of shriveled legumes during an Oct. 26 distribution. WFP country director El Khidir Daloum said it was investigating the complaint and,  is committed to providing our beneficiaries with the highest quality of food . John, the Refugee Welfare Committee chairman, said he urged people to stay in the camps.  At least let us die here of the hunger rather than go back to South Sudan and be killed like a chicken,  he said. But hungry refugees often ignore the pleas. At dusk last Saturday, Pastor Charles Mubarak packed extra clothes into a plastic bag to take back into South Sudan where he hoped to harvest cassava fields he left behind when he fled in January.  As a family, we are 10 in number, and I m not in position to feed them,  he said.  If I get killed I get killed once, but dying of hunger is too difficult.  Mubarak kissed each neatly folded shirt as he placed them in the bag.   If they give us the food rations, I wouldn t think of going back to South Sudan,  he said.  Food is life.  ",

        "title": "Rohingyas must go home but to safety, Bangladesh says",
        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - Bangladesh called on Myanmar on Monday to allow nearly 1 million Rohingya Muslim refugees to return home under safe conditions, saying that the burden had become  untenable  on its territory. About 600,000 people have crossed the border since Aug. 25 when Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts were met by a counter-offensive by the Myanmar army in Rakhine state which the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.  This is an untenable situation,  Shameem Ahsan, Bangladesh s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told a U.N. pledging conference.  Despite claims to the contrary, violence in Rakhine state has not stopped. Thousands still enter on a daily basis.  Vital humanitarian aid must continue, Ahsan said, adding:  It is of paramount importance that Myanmar delivers on its recent promises and works towards safe, dignified, voluntary return of its nationals back to their homes in Myanmar.  Bangladesh s interior minister was in Yangon on Monday for talks to find a  durable solution , he said. But Myanmar continued to issue  propaganda projecting Rohingyas as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh , Ahsan said, adding:  This blatant denial of the ethnic identity of Rohingyas remains a stumbling block.  Myanmar considers the Rohingya to be stateless, although they trace their presence in the country back generations. Filippo Grandi, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, later told journalists that the two countries had begun talks on  repatriation . Conducive conditions have to be  recreated  in Rakhine, he said.  This must include a solution to the question of citizenship, or rather lack thereof for the Rohingya community,  Grandi said. Khaled al-Jarallah, deputy foreign minister of Kuwait, called on Myanmar authorities to  cease the practice of stripping the Rohingya minority of their right of citizenship, which as a result deprives them of the right to property and employment . Jordan s Queen Rania visited Rohingya refugee camps on Monday and called for a stronger response from the international community to the plight of the Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh to escape  systematic persecution  in Myanmar.   One has to ask, why is the plight of this Muslim minority group being ignored? Why has the systematic prosecution been allowed to play out for so long?  she asked after touring the camps. The United Nations has appealed for $434 million to provide life-saving aid to 1.2 million people for six months. A total of $344 million has been raised so far, a final U.N. statement said.  We need more money to keep pace with intensifying needs. This is not an isolated crisis, it is the latest round in a decades-long cycle of persecution, violence and displacement,  U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told the talks. An estimated 1,000-3,000 Rohingya still enter Bangladesh daily, William Lacy Swing, head of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said. He called them:  these most rejected and vulnerable people in the world.  Joanne Liu, president of the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) or Doctors Without Borders, described them as  the walking dead .  There are only 210 hospital beds for 1 million refugees, malnutrition is on the rise and latrines are lacking to prevent contamination, she said.  The camp is a time-bomb, ticking towards a full-blown health crisis.  ",

        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will have no choice but to restrict its economic ties with Turkey to pressure its NATO partner into releasing German citizens it imprisoned on political grounds, Chancellor Angela Merkel said in remarks published on Saturday. Relations between the two countries are strained by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan s crackdown on opponents after a failed coup last year. Germany and its partners in the European Union say the crackdown undermines democracy. Turkey and Germany are also at odds over Berlin s refusal to extradite asylum seekers Erdogan accuses of involvement in the botched coup against him.  We will have to further cut back our joint economic cooperation with Turkey and scrutinize projects,  Merkel told the Passauer Neuen Presse newspaper in an interview when asked how she wants to secure the release of Germans held in Turkey. The simmering tensions have seeped into campaigning for a federal election in Germany, especially after Erdogan urged German Turks to boycott the main parties in the vote on Sept. 24. Home to some 3 million people of Turkish descent, Germany has traditionally had good relations with Turkey, which is also a major trade partner and tourist destination for German sun-seekers. German officials have been enraged by Turkey s arrest of around a dozen German citizens, including the German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, who has been held for more than 200 days. Merkel, whose conservatives are expected to win the election and secure her a fourth term in office, said on Tuesday Germany would restrict some arms sales to Turkey. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) who are trailing the conservatives in opinion polls, had earlier said that all major arms exports to Turkey had been put on hold. Merkel said during a televised debate earlier this month that Turkey should not become a member of the European Union - Turkey s largest trading partner with which it has a customs union. She said she would talk to Germany s EU partners to reach a compromise on ending Turkey s accession talks with the bloc.       ",

        "title": "Congress votes to avert shutdown, sends Trump stopgap spending bill",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress on Thursday averted a government shutdown just one day before federal funding was due to expire, sending President Donald Trump a bill to provide just enough money to keep agencies operating through Jan. 19. With lawmakers eager to begin a holiday recess until Jan. 3, the House of Representatives and Senate scurried to pass the hastily written bill by votes of 231-188 and 66-32, respectively. When Congress returns, lawmakers will immediately have to get back to work on appropriating more money for a fiscal year that already will be three months old. They will try to pass an \u201comnibus\u201d spending bill to fund the government from Jan. 19 through Sept. 30. Negotiators have been struggling for months over thorny issues such as the amount of defense-spending increases versus increases for other domestic programs, including medical research, opioid treatment and \u201canti-terrorism\u201d activities. Fiscal hawks, meanwhile, are angry that Congress is again moving to bust through spending caps that had been designed to tamp down mounting federal debt. But some of those same lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Congress earlier in the week voted for a sweeping tax bill that will add $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years to a national debt that already stands at $20 trillion. With the clock ticking toward a deadline of midnight on Friday when government funding would run out, Democrats in the House and Senate made a strong pitch for including protections for young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children, popularly known as \u201cDreamers.\u201d In the end, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and immigration advocacy groups failed. But nearly all of the House\u2019s 193 Democrats and 29 of the Senate\u2019s 46 Democrats voted no, in part to protest the lack of action on the immigration measure. Shortly before the House and Senate votes, Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez told reporters, \u201cWe\u2019re really tired of tomorrow,\u201d referring to years of failed attempts in Congress to protect Dreamers from deportation, allow them to legally work in the United States and get on a path to citizenship. They will resume their fight in January, aiming to win on the next spending bill or a separate measure. Trump has eliminated Obama-era temporary protections for Dreamers, but has asked Congress to come up with a permanent solution by March. In the meantime, about 122 Dreamers a day are becoming vulnerable to deportation while Congress bickers. Also on Thursday, the Senate put the brakes on another bill that passed the House, which would provide $81 billion in new disaster aid to help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and several states hit by this year\u2019s hurricanes or wildfires. The temporary spending bill did, however, give Trump a modest increase of $4.7 billion for the Department of Defense to be used for missile defense and ship repair. The bill includes $2.85 billion to fund the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program through March and funding for community health centers and the Indian Health Service. The plan also would extend the National Security Agency\u2019s expiring internet surveillance program, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, through Jan. 19. Other provisions address funding for veterans, the Coast Guard and flood insurance. Most government programs would be temporarily extended until Jan. 19 at fiscal 2017 levels. ",

        "title": "Panel's report reignites debate over Clinton and Benghazi",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Republicans on Tuesday accused Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department of failing to protect four Americans killed in a 2012 attack in Libya, in a final report that contained no major new revelations but rekindled debate on the U.S. presidential campaign trail. In an 800-page report that Democrats derided as a political vendetta, Republicans said Clinton, who served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, and her staff showed a \u201cshameful\u201d lack of response to congressional investigators looking into the attacks on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. The report, the culmination of a two-year investigation by a special congressional committee led by Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, is likely to be the last official attempt to investigate the attack. Seven other congressional panels have also investigated the attack on the U.S. diplomatic and CIA posts in Benghazi. The latest investigation has been used by Republicans to attack Clinton\u2019s national-security credentials. Opinion polls have shown Americans deeply split along partisan lines over the probe. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly charged that Clinton is personally responsible for the deaths of a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans killed by militia groups in the Sept. 11, 2012 incident. Clinton\u2019s campaign dismissed the committee\u2019s report, saying it had not found anything that had not been discovered by previous congressional probes. White House press secretary Josh Earnest labeled the effort a \u201cpolitical exercise.\u201d Clinton, speaking in Denver, said it was crucial to \u201clearn the right lessons\u201d from the Benghazi tragedy. \u201cNo one has thought more about or lost more sleep over the lives that we lost - the four Americans - which was devastating,\u201d said Clinton. Trump waited until hours after the report\u2019s release to comment. \u201cBenghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cIt just never seems to work the way it\u2019s supposed to with Clinton.\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Clinton\u2019s actions as secretary of state were \u201cdisqualifying.\u201d \u201cHillary Clinton was in charge, knew the risks, and did nothing\u201d to protect personnel on the ground in Libya, he said. Professor Julian Zelizer, a political analyst at Princeton University, called the report \u201cold news\u201d but said that would not stop Trump from trying to exploit the issue going forward. \u201cA story like this, even though it seems familiar, can still serve to mobilize Republicans, and certainly Donald Trump will do that. He\u2019ll certainly try,\u201d Zelizer said.  Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist, said he doubted the report would influence undecided voters. \u201cThose who are willing to believe that there was wrongdoing on Secretary Clinton\u2019s part were unlikely willing to vote for her in the first place,\u201d he said. At a news conference on Capitol Hill, Gowdy, chairman of the special congressional panel, said there was a disconnect between the violence unfolding in Benghazi and the perception among top Obama administration officials that \u201cthe fighting had subsided\u201d at the U.S. diplomatic compound. The committee\u2019s report faulted the State Department for providing inadequate security for the U.S. compound in Benghazi, State Department officials and the CIA for failing to properly evaluate the threat to U.S. personnel on the ground, and the Pentagon for not being in position to aid the Americans under siege. The report did not dispute assertions by the Obama administration that such a mission would have come too late to help the four who were killed. None of those conclusions, however, came as revelations. All had been reached by previous probes. The report also accused the White House of stonewalling the investigation, something aides to Obama have denied. Democrats on the Benghazi committee issued their own report a day before Tuesday\u2019s release, accusing Republicans of conducting an overzealous investigation. According to a website maintained by committee Democrats, the investigation cost more than $7.1 million, a figure that excludes money spent on investigations by the seven other congressional committees that investigated the attacks. The Gowdy committee investigation lasted 782 days, longer than congressional probes of Pearl Harbor, the Kennedy assassination, the Iran-Contra scandal and Hurricane Katrina. Since it was established in May 2014, the Gowdy committee has held four public hearings, according to its website, which said that it interviewed 107 witnesses, mostly behind closed doors, including 81 who never appeared before the other committees that investigated the attacks. It reviewed about 75,000 pages of previously unexamined documents. Last October, Clinton, already a Democratic presidential candidate, calmly deflected harsh Republican criticism of her handling of the attack during a testy 11-hour hearing before the Gowdy committee. In testimony that stretched deep into the night, Clinton rejected Republican accusations that she ignored requests for security upgrades in Libya and misinformed the public about the cause of the attack. Clinton\u2019s appearance before the panel followed months of controversy about her use of a private home email server for her State Department work, a disclosure that emerged in part because of the panel\u2019s demand to see her official records. A 2012 report by a government accountability review board faulted State Department officials for providing \u201cgrossly\u201d insufficient security in Benghazi, despite upgrade requests from Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and others in Libya. ",

        "title": "Britain's May sees off challenges to Brexit plan, so far",
        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May s blueprint to leave the European Union emerged unscathed on Tuesday from a first day of debate in parliament on legislation to sever ties with the bloc. The debate, expected to last for weeks, is on the EU withdrawal bill, seen by May as crucial to give companies confidence that there will be no major legal changes that affect business when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019. Opponents want to use the debate to force concessions on May s plan for leaving the bloc, but the initial challenges - including on the hour and day Britain should pull out as well as on the future role of the EU court - were voted down or dropped. The prime minister will face tougher battles as the debate goes on, testing her ability to steer through a bill intended largely to  copy and paste  European rules and regulations into British law by the time it leaves the 28-member EU. Her absence from parliament on Tuesday due to other engagements suggested she was not unduly worried by the initial discussion. But the debate s ill-tempered tone showed the level of anger in parliament with a government which some lawmakers say is mounting a power grab to force through its plans. With catcalls, sarcastic jokes and jeers being bandied about - not just between the two main parties, as is the custom, but often within them - many of the divisions before Britain voted in June 2016 to leave the EU re-emerged.  You re a disgrace,  one Conservative lawmaker yelled at another, while a Labour member of parliament openly quarreled with his colleagues in the main opposition party over which way their supporters voted in last year s referendum. Anna Soubry, a Conservative lawmaker, went on to criticize the  bullying  tactics of the Telegraph newspaper, who published the names of those politicians in May s party who voted against the government on the exact timing of Brexit. Behind the debate was the fear of pro-Brexit lawmakers that Britain may never leave the EU, and of pro-EU lawmakers who are worried Britain might crash out of the EU without a deal. The debates go to the heart of what parliament calls  one of the largest legislative projects ever undertaken in the UK , a process that could undermine May s already fragile authority. May, 61, has lost two ministers to scandals and her foreign minister, Boris Johnson, is facing calls to resign over remarks he made about a jailed Iranian-British aid worker in Iran. The Sunday Times has reported that 40 Conservatives support a no-confidence vote. May s Conservative government depends on a small Northern Irish party for its majority since a June election which dented her authority, and many lawmakers - even some Conservatives - will use the debate to increase pressure. The prime minister has tried to ease tensions by offering lawmakers some concessions on the bill before the debate began. But her moves have not yet eased everyone s concerns. One of her lawmakers, pro-EU Ken Clarke, ended his speech by saying:  I am a rebel.  ",

Last month, U.S.-backed militias declared victory in Raqqa, Islamic State s former headquarters in Syria, after months of fighting with the help of the U.S.-led coalition.  With the city liberated and ISIS on the run, the unit has been ordered home. Its replacements have been called off,  the coalition said in a statement, using an acronym for Islamic State.  We re drawing down combat forces where it makes sense, but still continuing our efforts to help Syrian and Iraqi partners maintain security,  Brigadier General Jonathan Braga, the director of operations for the coalition, said in the statement.  Our remaining forces will continue to work by, with, and through partner forces to defeat remaining ISIS, prevent a re-emergence of ISIS, and set conditions for international governments and NGOs to help local citizens recover from the horrors of ISIS  short-lived rule,  he said. Officially, the Pentagon says there are 503 troops in Syria. However, as of last week, U.S. officials said there were closer to 2,000 U.S. troops in the country. The latest announcement would reduce that number. As that campaign against Islamic State winds down, it is unclear how many, if any, U.S. troops will remain in Syria. Most of them are special operations forces, working to train and advise local partner forces, including providing artillery support against Islamic State militants. Separately, Russia said it was already preparing to withdraw its military contingent from Syria, Russian news agencies reported. ",

        "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner on Tuesday blocked hundreds of millions of new state dollars from going to cash-strapped Chicago Public Schools (CPS) by rewriting parts of a state school-funding overhaul bill, potentially imperiling the entire legislation and the flow of state money to all school districts. The Republican governor said he used his amendatory veto on the bill, which creates a new model for education funding, to remove \u201can unfair diversion\u201d of money to help fund CPS teacher pensions. \u201cSenate Bill 1, in its current form, took a significant increase in school funding I advocated for and diverted hundreds of millions of dollars from classrooms around the state to Chicago, unfairly hurting children across the state and unfairly advantaging one school district, a school district that has mismanaged its pension systems for decades,\u201d Rauner told reporters in the state capitol. His action marks a return to the political gridlock that left Illinois without a complete budget for an unprecedented two-straight fiscal years. The Democratic-controlled legislature gave CPS, which is struggling with escalating pension contributions, a funding boost for pensions and state aid in the bill passed in late May. The governor\u2019s office was not immediately able to say exactly how much money for CPS was cut by the veto action. The $36 billion fiscal 2018 state budget the legislature enacted in July over Rauner\u2019s veto prohibits the flow of $6.7 billion in state money to schools in the absence of a funding overhaul like lawmakers approved.  Rauner called for quick action by the General Assembly to accept his changes to the bill or to pass separate legislation reflecting what he wants so school operations will not be threatened. A failure by the House and Senate to muster a required three-fifths majority vote to override or accept the nine changes to the bill Rauner made would kill the measure. The governor has accused Democrats of jeopardizing the ability of schools to open later this month by not sending him the bill until Monday, two months after it was passed. The Illinois State Board of Education said it had not received any requests as of Tuesday from districts, which expect to receive their initial fiscal 2018 state funding by Aug. 10, to delay the start of their school year.  Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who controls the nation\u2019s third-largest public school system, said Rauner was \u201cignoring the needs of Illinois\u2019 school children\u201d and school superintendents who supported the bill.

        "title": "New rules give protesters more leeway at Republican convention",
        "text": "CLEVELAND (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday authorized a new plan allowing protesters at next month\u2019s Republican National Convention in Cleveland to demonstrate in an area that will be readily visible to convention goers. The new plan, approved by U.S. District Judge Dan Aaron Polster, also cuts in half the size of an \u201cevent zone\u201d where demonstrations and mobility will be limited and gives protesters more time to demonstrate. The agreement between the city of Cleveland and the American Civil Liberties Union resolves weeks of wrangling over the rules for what are expected to be lively protests when Donald Trump is due to become the Republican Party\u2019s official nominee for president at the July 18-21 convention. Trump campaign events have drawn raucous demonstrations,  with some resulting in clashes between his supporters and opponents. \u201cThis settlement is a significant improvement from what the city had previously offered,\u201d Christine Link, executive director for the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. The ACLU sued on behalf of three groups planning to organize thousands of demonstrators, calling the rules too restrictive. Dan Williams, spokesman for Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson, described the changes as \u201cminor\u201d and said he did not believe there would be an increased security risk as a result. Cleveland originally planned to cordon off 3.3 square miles (8.5 square km) around the convention site as an event zone where free speech mobility would be limited.  After another federal judge struck down the city\u2019s original plan, the two sides settled the lawsuit on Friday and took several days to work out details before revealing the new plan. The event zone is now 1.7 square miles (4.4 square km). The new zone frees up parkland where demonstrators will be able to organize before their protests. It also removes the Port of Cleveland and a small public airport for corporate jets and air taxi services from the restricted area. The main parade route for demonstrators now extends deeper into central Cleveland and will be more visible from the sports arena where the main event will take place, and more within the view of delegates and the media. The previous route took demonstrators further away from the center of town and over a bridge where they would be seen primarily by themselves. In addition, groups were granted extra staging time between protests. The ACLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of Citizens for Trump, a Texas-based group that supports the businessman\u2019s campaign; Organize Ohio, a liberal activist group; and Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, a charitable organization.

        "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Family members of Japanese abducted by North Korea met U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday and welcomed his sympathy for their \u201cvery sad\u201d plight, but said it meant nothing unless it led to action to bring home their loved ones. Trump has incorporated into his attacks on Pyongyang the story of Megumi Yokota, 13 when she was snatched off a lonely beach by North Korean agents 40 years ago, mentioning her in a September speech at the United Nations. For his part, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he will not rest until the return of all 13 of those Pyongyang says were kidnapped in the 1970s and 1980s to train spies, making the issue a keystone of his political career. On Monday, Trump met Megumi\u2019s mother Sakie, becoming the third president to do so, as well as the relatives of seven other abductees Pyongyang says are dead - like Megumi, who hanged herself, North Korea says. \u201cWe\u2019ll work together and see if we can do something, now the spotlight is on,\u201d Trump later told a joint news conference with Abe, calling the abductions a \u201cvery, very sad thing\u201d. \u201cPerhaps the regime itself would send them back. I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong Un would send them back.\u201d Megumi\u2019s mother and younger twin brothers were later part of a news conference that welcomed Trump\u2019s attention, although cautiously, with several members saying decades had passed and nothing had been done, even by Abe\u2019s government. \u201cIt seemed the president listened carefully to all our stories and was impressed,\u201d said Koichiro Iizuka, an infant abandoned in a creche when his mother, Yaeko Taguchi, was abducted in 1978. \u201cBut if this is all that comes of this meeting, it\u2019s absolutely outrageous,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s how we face the previous neglect and take action that\u2019s important.\u201d The families can do little, said Megumi\u2019s mother, now 81 and visibly frail. \u201cThis is an issue of politics, of diplomacy,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we can say is: please help them.\u201d ",

        "title": "Zimbabwe's Mugabe sacks VP seen as top succession candidate",
        "text": "HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s President Robert Mugabe fired Emmerson Mnangagwa as vice president on Monday for showing  traits of disloyalty , his information minister said, abruptly removing a favorite to succeed the 93-year-old leader. Mnangagwa s removal provides a boost for Mugabe s wife, Grace, who has been a vocal critic of the vice president and is also seen as a potential successor to her husband.  The vice president has consistently and persistently exhibited traits of disloyalty, disrespect, deceitfulness and unreliability,  Information Minister Simon Khaya Moyo told reporters.  It had become evident that his conduct in his discharge of his duties had become inconsistent with his official responsibilities.  Mnangagwa s top aide Christopher Gwatidzo said he had not seen the statement by Khaya Moyo and declined to say whether the vice president had been at his office on Monday.  Grace, 52, nicknamed  Gucci Grace  for her love of shopping, called Mnangagwa a  coup plotter  and a  coward  on Sunday in a speech that inflamed an already bad-tempered rift in the ruling Zanu-PF party. It followed a speech by Mugabe at a rally on Saturday where he publicly rebuked his deputy for the first time. The reaction of the military could be key. Some army generals backed Mnangagwa to succeed Mugabe and have publicly said they will not allow someone who did not fight in the 1970s independence war to rule. Grace did not fight in that war. Grace made international headlines in August when a South African model said the Zimbabwean first lady had whipped her with an electric cable in a Johannesburg hotel suite. Grace denied the allegations. The fight over the future control of ZANU-PF has overshadowed an economic crisis marked by chronic shortages of cash and spiraling prices of goods that has raised fears of a return to hyperinflation. Mnangagwa was Mugabe s protege and had been at his side through five decades of prison, guerrilla war and then post-liberation government, and questions are being raised about what caused the fallout between the two men. By firing Mnangagwa, Mugabe has removed one of his last remaining liberation war comrades who have stood by him since independence from Britain in 1980. However, Grace said on Sunday Mnangagwa had always been plotting against her husband, even months after independence. Mnangagwa s biggest undoing may well have been his vocal supporters, who kept prodding Mugabe to step down. Mugabe has a history of punishing ambition in ZANU-PF. Relations also cooled between the two men in August after suggestions by Mnangagwa s allies that he had been poisoned by ice cream from a dairy owned by the Mugabes. That Mnangagwa s expulsion was announced by a government minister and not the chief secretary to the president and cabinet also spoke to the deterioration in the relationship. Mugabe plans to contest elections due next year and will likely face a weakened and fractured opposition. His main rival Morgan Tsvangirai has been in and out of a South African hospital after announcing he had colon cancer in 2016. ",

        "text": "GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. migration agency called on social media giants on Friday to make it harder for people smugglers to use their platforms to lure West African migrants to Libya where they can face detention, torture, slavery or death. The smugglers often use Facebook to reach would-be migrants with false promises of jobs in Europe, International Organization for Migration (IOM) spokesman Leonard Doyle said. When migrants are tortured, video is also sometimes sent back to their families over WhatsApp, as a means of extortion, he said.  We really ... ask social media companies to step up and behave in a responsible way when people are being lured to deaths, to their torture,  Doyle told a Geneva news briefing. There were no immediate replies from Facebook or WhatsApp to requests by Reuters for comment. Hundreds of thousands of migrants have attempted to cross the Mediterranean to Europe since 2014 and 3,091 have died en route this year alone, many after passing through Libya. This year, the number of migrants entering Europe is 165,000, about 100,000 fewer than all of last year, but the influx has presented a political problem for European countries. IOM has been in discussions with social media providers about its concerns, Doyle said, adding:  And so far to very little effect. What they say is  please tell us the pages and we will shut them down .  It is not our job to police Facebook s pages. Facebook should police its own pages,  he said. Africa represents a big and expanding market for social media but many people are unemployed and vulnerable, he said.  Facebook is pushing out, seeking market share across West Africa and pushing out so-called free basics, which allows ... a  dumb phone  to get access to Facebook. So you are one click from the smuggler, one click from the lies,  he said. Social media companies are  giving a turbo-charged communications channel to criminals, to smugglers, to traffickers, to exploiters , he added. Images broadcast by CNN last month appeared to show migrants being auctioned off as slaves by Libyan traffickers. This sparked anger in Europe and Africa and highlighted the risks migrants face. Doyle called for social media companies to invest in civic-minded media outreach and noted that on Google, pop-up windows appear if a user is looking at pornography images, to warn of danger or criminality. The IOM has helped 13,000 migrants to return voluntarily to Nigeria, Guinea and other countries from Libya this year. It  provides them with transport and pocket money and documents their often harrowing testimonies.  Doyle said it was currently repatriating 4,000 migrants to Niger. Switzerland said on Friday it was willing to take in up to 80 refugees in Libya in need of protection, among 5,000 whom the UN refugee agency says are in a precarious position. ",

        "title": "Several senior State Department officials leave posts: officials",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has accepted the resignations of two top State Department officials effective on Friday, a step entirely within the new president\u2019s rights but an abrupt departure for the diplomats, officials said on Thursday. Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy and acting Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Thomas Countryman both plan to leave their posts by Friday, the officials said. Turnover is the rule, rather than the exception, among the top officials in the U.S. government when the White House changes hands from one party to another, in this case from Democrat Barack Obama to Republican Donald Trump. In his first week in office, Trump has illustrated stark policy differences from Obama on trade and immigration. On Monday, Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and on Wednesday he ordered construction of a wall on the border with Mexico and threatened to punish U.S. cities shielding illegal immigrants. Political appointees chosen by the president and confirmed by the Senate were obliged, as usual, after Trump\u2019s Nov. 8 election victory, to submit letters of resignation to give the new president the opportunity to name his own people to the jobs. Kennedy and Countryman were recently told their resignations had been accepted effective Friday, leaving their bureaus - one of which handles the department\u2019s management and the other which oversees arms control - in the hands of more junior officials. Gregory Starr, Assistant Secretary for State for Diplomatic Security and Michele Bond, Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, are also leaving, officials said, though it was not clear under what circumstances or whether they were asked to step down by Friday. Trump\u2019s nominee for Secretary of State, former Exxon Mobil Corp chairman Rex Tillerson, has yet to be confirmed by the full Senate, leaving the agency in the hands of number three official Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Shannon. The departures were discussed at State Department Thursday morning meetings and caused some unease, in part because at least two of the officials had been asked to go by Friday.  \u201cIt\u2019s not two weeks\u2019 notice,\u201d said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity. However, the department itself stressed that turnover is the norm when a new political party comes to power. \u201cOf the officers whose resignations were accepted, some will continue in the Foreign Service in other positions and others will retire by choice or because they have exceeded the time limits of their grade in service,\u201d acting State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement. It did not provide a detailed breakdown of whose resignations were accepted or when they were leaving. At least one media report suggested that the departures  amounted to a mass resignation, but several U.S. officials said this was not the case. \u201cIt\u2019s not a mass protest or a show of indignation,\u201d said one senior U.S. official. A former senior Obama administration official said there were no plans at the National Security Council for a mass resignation and that recent conversations there with Trump\u2019s inner circle had been viewed as productive and encouraging. The State Department departures amounted to a \u201chuge brain drain,\u201d the former official said, adding that their collective experience would be difficult to recover. However, a current State Department official rejected this view, saying that while Kennedy, in particular, was seen as an institution, he could certainly be replaced. \u201cEverybody is (acting) like it is a big apocalypse. He has large shoes to fill, but the culture of the State Department is about change and moving around every few years,\u201d said the official. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the building is going to fall apart.\u201d ",

        "text": "VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Legionaries of Christ, a Catholic religious order which fell into disgrace after the discovery that its founder was a sexual abuser with a secret family, has been hit by fresh scandal with revelations that the head of its Rome seminary fathered two children. The order said in a statement late on Friday that Father Oscar Turrion would leave the priesthood. It also released a letter by Turrion in which he asks  forgiveness for the scandal ... forgiveness for my bad example and the negative witness I have given . The Legionaries is a conservative order of Roman Catholic priests. Turrion was rector of the Pontifical International College Maria Mater Ecclesiae, a seminary for men in the order studying for the priesthood in pontifical universities in Rome. The Legionaries said Turrion, a 49-year-old Spaniard, told his superiors in March that he had just had a daughter. A new rector was appointed and Turrion was ordered not to practice his ministry publicly. On Thursday Turrion acknowledged that he had previously had a son with the same woman several years ago, the order said. This meant he had a secret family while he was head of the seminary. In his letter, Turrion said he did not come clean earlier  out of weakness and shame  and that he had not used any of the seminary s money, supporting his family with donations from friends. He said he had  lost his grounding  and fell in love with a woman during the period of turmoil that hit the order when revelations about its founder, Rev. Marcial Maciel Degollado,   came to light between 2006 and 2014. Maciel founded the order in Mexico in 1941 and for decades the Vatican dismissed accusations by seminarians that he had abused them sexually, some when they were as young as 12. The order was run like a cult, former members said, with rules forbidding any criticism of the founder or questioning his motives. Maciel enjoyed the support of the late Pope John Paul and was spared official censure for years despite what critics say was overwhelming proof of his crimes. In 2006, a year after John Paul s death, a Vatican investigation concluded that the previously denied accusations of molestation were true. Pope Benedict ordered Maciel to retire to a life of  prayer and penitence . After Maciel s death in 2008, Vatican investigations found that he had also fathered several children with at least two women, visited them regularly and sent them money. He also used drugs. The Vatican appointed a commissioner to run the order and phase in a new leadership, rejecting suggestions from critics that it be suppressed. New constitutions for the order were approved in 2014 but the Vatican still has a special representative in its leadership. Turrion s case was very similar to that of Thomas Williams, a former Legionaries member who left the priesthood in 2013 after it was discovered that he had fathered a child with the daughter of the former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican. Williams, an American moral theologian, kept his family secret while continuing to teach at the Legionaries university in Rome, appearing often on U.S. television.   ",

        "title": "Republicans move on tax reform; Fed officials see economic threats",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Republicans moved to hasten an overhaul of the U.S. tax code on Thursday, while Federal Reserve officials warned in rare public remarks that President Donald Trump\u2019s tax plan could lead to inflation and unsustainable federal debt. In a procedural step forward, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved by a 219-206 vote a fiscal 2018 spending blueprint to help advance an eventual tax bill. The blueprint contains a legislative tool that would let Republicans pass a tax bill by a simple majority vote in the Senate, where they hold 52 of 100 seats, allowing them to bypass Democrats. Separately, the Senate Budget Committee approved its own budget resolution and sent it to the full Senate for a vote, expected after Oct 16. Trump and top Republicans in Congress hope to enact a package of tax cuts for corporations, small businesses and individuals before January, pledging that sharply lower taxes will boost U.S. economic growth, jobs and wages. Wall Street rose on the steps taken, with major market indexes rising to record high closes again on Thursday as investors warmed to the notion that a sweeping tax overhaul could be in place by the first quarter. \"It sounds like they're serious about drafting tax reform legislation and that gives everyone greater confidence that this might actually happen,\" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors in New York. He predicted tax reform could lift economic growth and corporate earnings for 2019 and send the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX index above 3,000. The index on Thursday finished at 2,552.07. But Federal Reserve officials questioned the rosy Republican scenario, saying that proposed tax cuts could deliver a short-term growth surge but also bring high inflation, burdensome government debt levels and an eventual return to sub-par economic growth. Unless targeted to raise productivity and underlying potential, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said a tax cut could feed \u201cunsustainable\u201d growth that would ultimately be undone by asset price bubbles, inflation and possible recession. Fed officials generally refrain from commenting on fiscal policy. But the Trump administration is proposing up to $6 trillion in personal and corporate tax cuts at a time when many economists feel the country does not need massive stimulus.  The procedural actions in Congress set the stage for a possible clash among Republicans that could delay consideration of a bill. While the House budget prohibits tax reform from adding to the deficit, the Senate\u2019s version would allow tax legislation to lose $1.5 trillion in revenue over a decade. Republicans claim tax reform would reduce the deficit in years beyond a decade.  House and Senate Republicans must iron out their differences and approve the same budget resolution before it can provide Republicans the legislative advantage requiring only a simple majority vote in the Senate known as reconciliation.  The criticism from the Fed was only the latest to hit the Republican plan.  Democrats have assailed it as benefiting the wealthiest Americans while raising taxes on the middle class and cutting spending on social programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid healthcare programs for senior citizens, the poor and the disabled. Republican lawmakers are also questioning a proposal to help pay for tax cuts by eliminating popular tax deductions. Some Republican fiscal hawks have warned they will not back a tax reform package that adds to the deficit. The Trump tax plan would add about $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, said the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank, at a time when the national debt already exceeds $20 trillion. \u201cWhere is all that money coming from?\u201d Representative John Yarmuth, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, asked on the House floor. \u201cIf you\u2019re listening to this and you\u2019re not a millionaire, probably from you.\u201d In the Senate, Democrats sought to hamstring the Republican budget resolution with amendments that would prevent tax legislation from benefiting the wealthy, raising taxes on the middle class and adding to the deficit. But Republicans successfully turned aside the effort by voting the measures down. Democrats also called for an end to reconciliation, the legislative procedure that would sideline them in a Senate vote. ",

        "title": "Yahoo scanning order unlikely to be made public: sources",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Obama administration officials briefed key congressional staffers last week about a secret court order to Yahoo Inc YHOO.O that prompted it to search all users\u2019 incoming emails for a still undisclosed digital signature, but they remain reluctant to discuss the unusual case with a broader audience. Executive branch officials spoke to staff for members of the Senate and House of Representatives committees overseeing intelligence operations and the judiciary, according to people briefed on the events, which followed Reuters\u2019 disclosure of the massive search.[nL2N1C601L] But attempts by other members of Congress and civil society groups to learn more about the Yahoo order are unlikely to meet with success anytime soon, because its details remain a sensitive national security matter, U.S. officials told Reuters. Release of any declassified version of the order is unlikely in the foreseeable future, the officials said. The decision to keep details of the order secret comes amid mounting pressure on the U.S. government to be more transparent about its data-collection activities ahead of a congressional deadline next year to reauthorize some foreign intelligence authorities. On Tuesday, more than 30 advocacy groups will send a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper asking for declassification of the Yahoo order that led to the search of emails last year in pursuit of data matching a specific digital symbol. \u201cWe believe such a massive scan of the emails of millions of people, particularly if it involves the scanning of email content, could violate (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act), the Fourth Amendment, and international human rights law,\u201d the coalition wrote in an advance draft of the letter that was shared with Reuters.  The Center for Democracy & Technology, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Brennan Center, Human Rights Watch and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers are among the signatories. The groups say that Title I of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, under which sources said the order was issued, requires a finding that the target of such a wiretap is probably an agent of a foreign power and that the facility to be tapped is probably going to be used for a transmission. An entire service, such as Yahoo, has never publicly been considered to be a \u201cfacility\u201d in such a case: instead, the word usually refers to a phone number or an email account. The groups also pressed Clapper, who has pledged to be more transparent in the wake of controversial spying revelations, to explain how much authority the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has to order technical assistance from technology companies. Reuters reported that Yahoo had installed a special program that was hidden inside a Linux kernel module on its mail servers, where security staffers found it. Representative Justin Amash, who does not sit on one of the relevant committees, recently asked that all of Congress be briefed, given the significance of any change in interpreting foreign intelligence laws.  \u201cThe briefing should involve all members, because all members will within about a year have to vote on a significant part of FISA,\u201d said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy & Technology, which circulated Tuesday\u2019s letter among free speech and privacy advocates. \u201cThey should know what occurred so that they can decide whether to outlaw it.\u201d  Also last week, Yahoo itself asked Clapper to declassify the secret order or at least describe it, so that the company could respond to news reports and criticism that it did not do more to protect its users\u2019 communications.  The American Civil Liberties Union meanwhile filed a motion in the surveillance court asking that the Yahoo order and other significant ruling going back a decade be unsealed. ",

        "title": "Buoyed by mayoral votes, Venezuela socialists eye presidency race",
        "text": "CARACAS (Reuters) - President Nicolas Maduro has set his sights on Venezuela s 2018 presidential election after the ruling Socialist Party dominated mayoral polls with the help of a partial boycott by a divided opposition. Enjoying a political breather after a year of ferocious domestic protests and damaging foreign sanctions, the 55-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez said the government had won at least 90 percent of the 335 mayorships in Sunday s election. Latest official results gave him 21 of 23 state capitals as well as Caracas  main district, with full results due later on Monday. The landslide win for the socialists was no surprise, given three of the biggest opposition parties did not field candidates.  The elections left Maduro favorite to be the socialist candidate in next year s presidential race, despite the ambitions of rivals within government and an economic crisis that has pummeled the OPEC nation since his 2013 election.  Let s get ready for 2018!  he told cheering supporters in a Caracas square shortly before midnight on Sunday, next to a statue of Venezuela s independence hero Simon Bolivar.  Maduro also declared fixing Venezuela s broken economy a priority. But opponents and even some government dissenters say it is his stubborn adherence to Chavez-era economic policies, such as currency controls, that is to blame for the crisis. Venezuela s 30 million people are enduring one of the worst economic meltdowns in recent Latin American history. Millions are skipping meals, missing medicines, and lining up for hours at shops during acute shortages and crippling inflation. Opposition parties said Sunday s vote was full of irregularities and meaningless, and reiterated demands for changes to the electoral system for the 2018 vote.   What we saw yesterday was an electoral farce that in no way represents the will of the people,  said Popular Will party leader Juan Andres Mejia, citing abuse of state resources and coercion of government employees to vote. MADURO  WELL-POSITIONED  FOR RE-ELECTION Three of the opposition coalition s main parties - Popular Will, Justice First and Democratic Action - boycotted Sunday s polls, saying the election board was a pawn of the government. But other opposition parties did put up candidates, adding to confusion and acrimony within opposition ranks.  Maduro said the three abstaining parties should be banned from participating in future elections. That brought a rebuke from the U.S. State Department, which called his remarks  another extreme measure to close democratic space in Venezuela and consolidate power in his authoritarian dictatorship.  Venezuela s presidential election has traditionally been held in December, but there is speculation in political circles that it will be brought forward to the first half of 2018 so the socialists can take advantage of the opposition s disarray.  Despite the regime s economic incompetence and the inherent weaknesses of Maduro s authoritarianism, he is well positioned to achieve re-election next year,  said Nicholas Watson, of the Teneo Intelligence consultancy. With its most popular leaders barred - Leopoldo Lopez is under arrest and Henrique Capriles is prohibited from office - the opposition may struggle to find a flagbearer. Uniting parties and reigniting enthusiasm among despondent grassroots supporters will also be huge challenges. Street protests earlier in 2017 put pressure on Maduro and left 125 people dead. Foreign pressure hardened too, with U.S. President Donald Trump imposing sanctions on Venezuela for alleged government rights abuses and corruption. Yet after facing down demonstrators, pushing through a controversial legislative superbody in a July vote also boycotted by the opposition, and notching a majority in October gubernatorial polls, Maduro has ridden out the storm for now.   I think the current government can fix things if they are allowed to get on with it,  said mechanic Melix Jordan, 56, voting for the government in a rural part of Paraguana. Social discontent is running deep, however. There is no sign so far of an alternative presidential candidate, despite calls in some quarters for popular billionaire businessman Lorenzo Mendoza to run.  My vote maybe doesn t change anything,  said gardener Hector Machado, 64, who voted for the opposition in Tachira state.  But I still have hope for something better next year.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain on Thursday vowed to block use of a cost-plus type of contract, under which the government would be responsible for cost overruns, for a new long-range bomber to be built by Northrop Grumman Corp. McCain told reporters he would seek to block authorization of the new U.S. Air Force long-range strike bomber in its current form, arguing that cost-plus deals inevitably lead to cost overruns. \u201cWe can disapprove it ... I will not authorize a program that has a cost-plus contract,\u201d McCain said, when asked about the contract, which the U.S. Air Force has already signed with Northrop. McCain said the military often argued that cost-plus contracts were necessary in cases involving cutting-edge technologies since unknown problems could emerge, but such practices were unheard of in Silicon Valley. The Air Force said that only the engineering and development phase of the program, valued at $21.4 billion, was structured as a cost-plus contract with incentive fees. The second part of the contract, which would cover initial production of the first five sets of new bombers, usually the most expensive planes in a new class of aircraft, would be structured with a firm, fixed-price. The Air Force has not disclosed the full projected cost of the program, although it has said that it expects to pay $511 million per plane in 2010 dollars. \u201cThe Air Force values the oversight role that Senator McCain has and looks forward to continuing to work with him and the committee on moving forward with this critical capability for the department and the nation. The Department looks forward to being able to provide the Senator a complete briefing of the program at his earliest convenience,\u201d the aerial warfare service said. Officials were expected to brief McCain in the next couple of weeks, a spokeswoman said. Northrop declined comment. The Senate Armed Services Committee and its counterpart in the House of Representatives approve legislation that sets defense policy, while funding for the military is governed by the House and Senate appropriations committees. McCain also took issue with the high level of secrecy shrouding the bomber program, and the Air Force\u2019s refusal thus far to divulge the names of key suppliers on the program. \u201cIf someone wants to build an engine for an airplane that requires congressional authorization, then it must be known who\u2019s making it and under what circumstances,\u201d he said.

Earlier on Monday, American-backed Syrian militias said that Russian warplanes had struck their positions in Deir al-Zor province near a natural gas field they seized from Islamic State last week. Russia denied that.

        "title": "Scotland may give Labour another chance at British power",
        "text": "GLASGOW, Scotland (Reuters) - Britain s opposition Labour Party is poised for a resurgence in Glasgow, raising its hopes that a recovery from a disastrous election performance in Scotland two years ago can help its socialist leader Jeremy Corbyn win power in London. A Labour stronghold for decades until it rejected the party in 2015 in favor of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP), Scotland s largest city is showing signs of returning to its political roots.  With a 41.5 percent share of the overall British vote in recent opinion polling, Corbyn sees himself positioned to form a  government if Prime Minister Theresa May s divided Conservatives falter over Britain s exit from the European Union. Winning back some of Scotland s 59 parliamentary seats is key to his plan. With this in mind, Corbyn toured target Scottish constituencies after June s national election left May s Conservatives severely weakened.  There are still many people who need to be persuaded to put their trust in the Labour Party once again,  Corbyn told a meeting in the Highlands ski-resort of Aviemore last month.  But this is the beginning of the rebirth of Scottish Labour.   Scotland, where the SNP lost seats to Labour in the west and to the Conservatives in the northeast in June, is shaping up to be a major battleground in the next British election, due in 2022. Labour winning in Glasgow, a city of one million people that backed secession from Britain in a referendum in 2014, would make the arrival of Prime Minister Corbyn more likely and  reduce the chances of Scottish independence by damaging the SNP. Labour policies, such as renationalization of the railways and more funding for public services, appeal to Scots on the left though they may scare off more conservative voters with higher taxes and controls over the free market.  Scottish Labour announces a new leader on Saturday, after a contest between trade unionist Richard Leonard, whom many see as favorite because his views align with Corbyn, and more centrist Anas Sarwar, the Glasgow-born son of the UK s first elected Asian lawmaker.  Margaret Young, a 50-year-old nurse, lives in Glasgow East, a central district which, until the 1960s, was an industrial powerhouse and is now one of Scotland s poorest areas. Once the site of massive steel-works it is home to a shopping center called  The Forge,  and around half of residents here are classed by the government as income-deprived. In June, Young switched her vote to Labour from the SNP, because she thinks Corbyn will loosen the government s purse strings. The SNP held Glasgow East by just 75 votes, down from 10,000 two years ago.  Young blames May s Conservatives in London for poor public services and the SNP for failing to mitigate spending cuts.  Austerity is definitely what is hurting us,  she told Reuters, saying it was  disgusting  that struggling families on welfare were being penalized. Of a dozen people interviewed by Reuters in East Glasgow,  10 said they would vote for Labour or consider it seriously. East Glasgow and seven other seats in the Glasgow area are among 21 Scottish constituencies held by the SNP that would need a swing of less than 5 percent for a Labour win, according to pollster Survation. At present Labour has 7 Scottish seats. With just a handful more votes in each marginal area, Scotland could make the difference between a minority and a majority Labour government in Britain s 650-seat House of Commons. As most of Scotland s budget is controlled by the government in London, Young believes only Corbyn can bring real change. Scots like Young now seem to blame the SNP, in power in the devolved Scottish parliament for a decade, rather than the UK government in London for not sending enough money to Scotland.  Glasgow, an industrial center on Britain s northwestern coast, was a hub of left-wing radicalism and a lynchpin of Labour s political success nationwide for nearly a century. Under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, the party took a centrist direction and Labour started to fall out of favor in the north. Labour was spurned by Scottish voters when it campaigned with the rival Conservatives to defend the 300-year-old union of England and Scotland in the 2014 referendum. Scots rejected independence, but in a British election eight months later, Labour lost all but one of its 41 seats in Scotland.  A lot of people who voted  Yes  during the referendum did so because they wanted a sense of change,  said Kate Watson, the Labour candidate in Glasgow East.  Jeremy s given us permission to be heard again.   Corbyn avoids mention of Blair and Brown and namechecks Labour s first leader Keir Hardie as a mentor, appealing to old party values which play well here. Rebecca Hynam, 30, is a primary school teacher who says politicians would be  shocked  by shortages of staff and materials in schools. She backs Corbyn.  In maths, we don t have enough calculators for my class.   Glaswegians interviewed seemed to overlook the weaknesses of Scottish Labour: its flip-flops on the independence question and its wobbles on what it wants from Brexit. Nevertheless many trust Corbyn, whose personal style reminds some people of a kindly schoolteacher, to make amends. One is Andrea, a 55-year-old secretary who voted Labour for the first time in June.  He seems like a neighbor next door, that s what I like about him. He seems to speak from the heart.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton formally concluded the U.S. Democratic presidential race on Tuesday with a win in the District of Columbia primary, then turned her focus to uniting the party during a 90-minute private meeting with defeated rival Bernie Sanders. Clinton, who secured enough delegates to clinch the nomination last week, met with Sanders in a downtown Washington hotel as the sometimes bitter primary combatants searched for common ground ahead of the Nov. 8 election against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Sanders has resisted pressure to bow out and endorse Clinton in a show of party unity, choosing to continue his campaign as leverage to win concessions from Clinton on his policy agenda and reforms to the Democratic Party nominating process. Both camps described the meeting as \u201cpositive\u201d and said the two noted their shared commitment to stopping Trump and pursuing issues such as raising the minimum wage, eliminating undisclosed money in politics, making college affordable and making healthcare coverage more accessible. Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said the meeting was \u201ca positive discussion about how best to bring more people into the political process and about the dangerous threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation.\u201d Also attending were Sanders\u2019 wife Jane, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and the two campaign managers, Jeff Weaver for Sanders and Robby Mook for Clinton. Sanders had promised to stay in the Democratic race until the final vote was cast in the Washington, D.C., primary, although in the past week he has stopped talking about capturing the party\u2019s nomination and instead focused on ways to advance his policy goals. He scheduled a national video address to supporters on Thursday night, telling them in an email message that \u201cthe political revolution continues.\u201d At a news conference before the Washington meeting, Sanders said he would also demand changes to make the Democratic nominating process more equitable, including replacing the Democratic National Committee leadership, letting independents take part in the voting and eliminating superdelegates, who are unelected and are free to support any candidate. \u201cThe time is long overdue for a fundamental transformation of the Democratic Party,\u201d Sanders said. Clinton easily beat Sanders in the District of Columbia, winning 79 percent to his 21 percent in a primary that closed the more than four-month, state-by-state battle for the Democratic nomination that began on Feb. 1 in Iowa. During a visit to Capitol Hill earlier on Tuesday, Sanders told Democratic senators he would take his message of progressive values and party reform to the convention. \u201cI\u2019m open to that, I think we should all be open to that,\u201d Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois told reporters afterward. \u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise that the American people are skeptical of all of us in political life. And we ought to step back and reassess why, and what we can do about it.\u201d Top Democrats have taken steps in the last week to begin rallying behind Clinton and ease Sanders out of the race without alienating his supporters.  President Barack Obama endorsed Clinton on Thursday, hours after meeting with Sanders at the White House. Clinton also secured the endorsement of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a leader of the party\u2019s progressive wing. Clinton already has turned her attention on the campaign trail to the race with Trump, rejecting the New York businessman\u2019s renewed calls for a ban of the entry of foreign-born Muslims into the United States after the mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, by an American man who claimed allegiance with Islamic State militants. \u201cI have clearly said that we faced terrorist enemies who use a perverted version of Islam to justify slaughtering innocent people. We have to stop them, and we will,\u201d Clinton said in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday. \u201cBut I will not demonize and declare war on an entire religion.\u201d ",

When he first came to power, Museveni was lauded for helping restore stability after two murderous dictators known to use torture and extrajudicial executions widely, and for directing the suppression of a brutal insurgency known for mutilating civilians and kidnapping children. But over the years, criticism has mounted over the suppression of the political opposition, widespread corruption and a poor human rights record. Simeo Nsubuga, a legislator from Museveni s ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party, told Reuters the move to amend the constitution was agreed in a special meeting of the party s House members.  We agreed that a private member should come up with a constitutional amendment bill to remove the age limit,  Nsubuga said, adding the bill would be introduced on the floor next week. In July, Uganda s deputy attorney general said cabinet was planning to introduce similar legislation. Most Ugandan laws are introduced by the government via cabinet ministers. But Kafuuzi Jackson Karugaba, another NRM legislator, told Reuters they had decided to take the option of a private member s bill because cabinet was moving  too slowly.   In 2005, NRM legislators changed the constitution and removed a limit of two five-year terms, allowing Museveni to extend his reign. Independent observers said that last year s presidential election lacked transparency and that the poll body lacked credibility. The ageing leader has himself not stated whether he intends to seek another term, and officials have said the proposed constitutional change was not specifically to benefit the incumbent but all of Uganda s future leaders.

        "text": "BOGOTA (Reuters) - Pope Francis arrived in Colombia on Wednesday with a message of unity for a nation deeply divided by a peace deal that ended a five-decade war with Marxist FARC rebels but left many victims of the bloodshed wary of the fraught healing process. Francis, making his 20th foreign trip since becoming pontiff in 2013 and his fifth to his native Latin America, started his visit in Colombian capital Bogota. He will travel later in the week to the cities of Villavicencio, Medellin and Cartagena. Greeted at the airport by President Juan Manuel Santos as attendees waved white handkerchiefs, the Argentine pope hopes his presence will help build bridges in a nation torn apart by bitter feuding over a peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Speaking to reporters on the Bogota-bound plane, Francis said the trip was  a bit special because it is being made to help Colombia go forward on its path to peace.  Francis will encourage reconciliation as Colombians prepare to receive 7,000 former FARC fighters into society and repair divisions after a war that killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions over five decades. References to the recent peace deal were immediate. A teenage boy, born in 2004 to vice presidential candidate Clara Rojas when she was held captive in the jungle by the FARC, handed Francis a white porcelain dove as a welcome present. On his drive to the Vatican Embassy in central Bogota, the leader of the world s Roman Catholics was mobbed in the  pope mobile  by screaming crowds tossing flowers and holding up children to be kissed.  Peace is what Colombia has been seeking for a long time and is working to achieve,  the pope said in a video message ahead of his arrival.  A stable, lasting peace, so that we see and treat each other as brothers, never as enemies.       The FARC, which began as a peasant revolt in 1964 and battled more than a dozen governments, has formed a political party and now hopes to use words instead of weapons to effect changes in Colombia s social and economic model. But many Colombians are furious that the 2016 peace deal with the government granted fighters amnesty and some will be rewarded with seats in congress. A referendum on the deal last year was narrowly rejected, before being later modified and passed by congress. Trumpet players, singing children and white-clad rappers greeted the pope - wearing a traditional woolen poncho - at the embassy where he urged young people to  keep smiling  and then led the crowd in the Hail Mary prayer.  Don t let anyone steal your hope,  he said. People lined up all day to see the pope pass by, queues stretched around the cathedral in Bogota as residents sought passes for his events, and street vendors sold t-shirts, baseball caps and posters carrying Francis s image.  Pope Francis coming to Colombia has to unite the people. We cannot continue to be polarized. We must learn to live in peace and respect our differences,  Lucia Camargo, a pensioner, said as she lined up for a glimpse of the pontiff. Although most church leaders have voiced support for the accord, some politicians and Catholic bishops have criticized the deal for being too lenient on the guerrillas. The pope is expected to urge them to set aside their differences.  The visit will leave us a sense of union, of forgiveness,   Bogota Mayor Enrique Penalosa told Reuters.  Colombia is very polarized at the moment. There are many passions, many hatreds.  Reconciliation will be the emphasis for events on Friday in the city of Villavicencio, south of Bogota, where the pope will listen to testimonials from people whose lives were affected by the violence and then deliver a homily. Victims and former rebels who demobilized prior to the accord will attend. The pope will not meet FARC leaders or the opposition. He also had a message of dialogue and forgiveness for neighboring Venezuela, wracked by months of protests against President Nicolas Maduro, who has tightened his hold on power as an economic crisis has escalated. As his plane flew over the socialist nation, the pope sent  cordial greetings  in a telegram to Maduro and Venezuelans.   Praying that all in the nation may promote paths of solidarity, justice and harmony, I willingly invoke upon all of you God s blessings of peace,  he said. ",

        "text": "ST. LOUIS (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump publicly broke with his running mate, Mike Pence, on how to deal with the civil war in Syria in comments during Sunday\u2019s U.S. presidential debate that exposed further tensions within their campaign. \u201cHe and I haven\u2019t spoken, and I disagree,\u201d Trump said in response to a question from a moderator about comments by Pence that the United States should be ready to use force against Syrian military targets under the command of President Bashar al-Assad. \u201cI believe we have to get ISIS.

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would visit Britain for the opening of his Scottish golf resort on June 24, his first trip to the UK since a spat with Prime Minister David Cameron over comments he made about Muslims. Relations between Cameron and Trump, whose visit comes the day after Britain holds a referendum on its membership of the European Union, have been tense since the British leader called his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States dangerous and stupid. Trump\u2019s idea for a boycott of Muslims, mooted last December, also led to calls from some lawmakers for him to be banned from Britain, with almost 600,000 people signing an online petition to keep him out. While Cameron and his ministers rejected that call, the prime minister did suggest that Trump would unite the nation against him if he visited Britain.  Trump responded by saying he was unlikely to have a good relationship with Cameron, although both men have since tempered their language after Trump effectively became the presumptive Republican Party nominee. Cameron has said he would be happy to meet him, although no date had been fixed, and Trump said they could have a good relationship after all. A spokesman for Cameron said there were no firm plans for a meeting, although it was a long-standing practice for a prime minister to meet presidential nominees if they visited Britain. Trump\u2019s visit will coincide with the result of Britain\u2019s EU referendum, and while Cameron is leading the campaign for Britain to stay in the bloc, Trump has said he thinks Britons would be better off outside. In a statement, Trump made no mention of any potential Cameron meeting, saying only that his visit to Britain was for the official opening of his golf resort at Turnberry following a 200 million pound ($290 million) refurbishment. A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said the date of the opening had been planned long in advance and that it was just a coincidence it came the day after the EU vote. The date would not be changed, she added. The golf course has itself pitted Trump against British politicians after Scotland\u2019s devolved government approved plans for an offshore wind farm nearby which led Trump to denounce Scottish ministers as \u201cfoolish, small minded and parochial\u201d.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said Thursday it will take up a proposal this month to revise its rules to allow law enforcement personnel to identify threatening callers, following a series of threatening calls to Jewish community centers. In March, the FCC granted an emergency temporary waiver to Jewish community centers and telecommunications carriers that serve them to help track down callers who have made threats by unmasking phone numbers used to call in threats. FCC rules generally require phone companies to respect a calling party\u2019s request to have caller-ID information blocked from the party receiving the call. Jewish community centers and schools in at least 13 U.S. states reported receiving bomb threats this year, stoking fears of a resurgence of anti-Semitism. The \u201cepisode raised the question of whether we need to make permanent changes to our rules,\u201d FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a blog post Thursday. The FCC will \u201cconsider a proposal to change the rules to ensure that all threatened parties and associated law enforcement personnel have quick access to the information they need to identify and thwart threatening callers,\u201d he added. In April, prosecutors identified an Israeli-American teenager accused of making dozens of bomb threats to Jewish community centers in separate criminal complaints filed in U.S. federal courts in Florida and Georgia that linked him to hundreds of threatening calls in 2015 and 2017. Michael Ron David Kadar, 18, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen who is Jewish and lives in Israel, made at least 245 threatening telephone calls between Jan. 4 and March 7 this year, many targeting Jewish community centers in the United States, according to the Florida complaint. The FCC has only rarely granted waivers to access caller information. In 2015, the Middletown School District in New York state was inundated by phone calls making terrorism threats from anonymous numbers. Following the calls, then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler approved a special waiver in 2016 to access the caller information of the individuals making the threats. ",

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will not resolve the question of the Irish border after Brexit until it has also agreed the outline of a trade deal with the European Union, the country s International Trade Minister Liam Fox said on Sunday. The EU has said  sufficient progress  needs to be made on the border between the Republic and Northern Ireland, along with two other key issues, before EU leaders meeting at a summit on Dec. 14-15 can approve the opening of trade talks next year. However, Fox said it would be very difficult to address the issue of the border while Britain s relationship with the EU after Brexit remains unclear.  We don t want there to be a hard border but the United Kingdom is going to be leaving the customs union and the single market,  he told Sky News.  We can t get a final answer to the Irish question until we get an idea of the end state, and until we get into discussions with the European Union on the end state that will be very difficult.    Dublin wants a written guarantee that there will be no hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Earlier on Sunday Ireland s EU commissioner said Dublin would  continue to play tough  over its threat to veto talks about trade after Brexit unless Britain provided guarantees over the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Phil Hogan, the EU s agricultural commissioner, said that Britain, or Northern Ireland at least, should remain in the single market and the customs union to avoid a hard border dividing the island.  If the UK or Northern Ireland remained in the EU customs union, or better still the single market, there would be no border issue,  he told the Observer newspaper. Irish and EU officials say the best way to avoid a  hard border  - which could include passport and customs controls - is to keep regulations the same north and south, but the Northern Irish party that is propping up May s government will oppose any deal that sees the province operate under different regulations to the rest of the United kingdom.   We will not support any arrangements that create barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom or any suggestion that Northern Ireland, unlike the rest of the UK, will have to mirror European regulations,  the Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster said on Saturday. Ruth Davidson, leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, said on Sunday that the Irish border was  one of the really difficult bits  of the negotiations. She said Britain s unique future position as the only country that had left the European Union meant its did not need an  off-the-shelf  solution, although she did not specify how the issue should be resolved. She said any delay in moving onto trade talks would have serious repercussions for businesses.  I think that it is really important that we get the transitional deal nailed down; that s not for government, that s for businesses so they know what they are doing next year and they are able to plan,  she said.  If we don t make it through in the next two weeks to move onto that next phase, then we are rapidly going to run out of time in terms of getting us to a good position at the time that transitional deal is supposed to take place.

        "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela s former oil czar Rafael Ramirez said on Wednesday the government would make one of its  worst political moves  if investigators target him in an anti-corruption purge, which is gaining traction ahead of the country s 2018 presidential election. Friction between Ramirez and President Nicolas Maduro reflect growing rifts in the Socialist Party once firmly united under late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez. This comes amid a deep economic recession and financial sanctions imposed by the United States on what it considers a  dictatorship.   Ramirez, who spoke with Reuters from an undisclosed location after being pushed out last week as Venezuela s ambassador to the United Nations, said he is waiting for the right time to return to his country. The 54-year-old engineer also said he has not yet decided if he will launch a run in the 2018 Venezuelan presidential election, in which Maduro is expected to seek another term.  Ramirez, who led state-run oil company PDVSA for a decade under Chavez, said he has not been approached by Venezuelan or U.S. prosecutors investigating corruption cases linked to PDVSA and its subsidiaries. Some of those probes focus on incidents that occurred under his watch as one of Chavez  longest serving officials.  I have not been involved in any act of corruption. I have been very careful to follow internal control mechanisms,  he said. Thus far, the expanding corruption probe by the state prosecutor s office has resulted in authorities accusing over 100 people, including two former PDVSA presidents who also served as oil ministers under Maduro. Ramirez said he is prepared to fight back if investigators target him or his close family, some of whom served as advisors of the Venezuelan government in international arbitration cases.  That scenario would be offbeat. Who aims to attack my family is going to find me,  he said. He added that he trusts Venezuelan institutions will confirm his family members have faithfully served Venezuela, not charging the government for their work.  One of Ramirez s relatives, Diego Salazar, was detained last week under accusations of corruption and money laundering. Still, Ramirez said accusations from corruption scandals should not be taken lightly because they hurt PDVSA s reputation and its ability to recover from a deep production decline. The country s oil output has fallen this year to its lowest level in almost three decades, down 1 million barrels per day from its 2013 level. But he also criticized the government s focus on PDVSA in its corruption accusations, while excluding public institutions that oversaw a long-standing currency control system used to convert and distribute billions of dollars coming from exports.  The company should be investigated without subjecting its  employees to a  moral lynching,  he said.  I will believe that a corruption probe is genuine when it includes the whole Venezuelan economy.  Ramirez in 2014 submitted an economic plan to the government before moving to his position in the United Nations. But no action was taken due to the central government s lack of confidence in him, he said. In the following years, the government s failure to take needed actions, which also has been criticized by analysts and the opposition, have led to a greater financial instability, spiraling inflation and mounting debt, which Maduro is now struggling to restructure.  Economic action has to be taken with urgency,  he said. A lack of motivation among PDVSA s workers, delayed crude output due to infrastructure problems and a very low currency exchange rate impacting PDVSA s cash flow also have to be addressed, he said.

        "text": "SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Indian soldiers killed a relative of a top Pakistan-based militant in a gunbattle in southern Kashmir, police said on Tuesday, increasing the pressure on the leader whom it wants placed on an international blacklist. India, backed by the United States, has been trying to get Maulana Masood Azhar on a U.N. list of groups and individuals with ties to al Qaeda, blaming his group for a series of attacks in India, including one on its parliament in 2002 and another last year on an airbase. On Monday, soldiers surrounded a village in Pulwama district and killed Talha Rasheed, a nephew of Azhar, along with two associates in the gunfight, police inspector general Muneer Khan said.  They were all members of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad group. India has long accused Pakistan of harboring militant groups and giving them material support to carry out a 28-year armed revolt in disputed Kashmir. Pakistan denies the allegations and says it is doing more than any other country in fighting militant groups. Masood has become a thorny issue between India and China which has blocked its repeated requests to sanction him under the UN list of terrorists. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday that the United States was seeking to add a five-year sunset provision to the North American Free Trade Agreement to provide a regular, \u201csystematic re-examination\u201d of the trade pact. Ross told a forum hosted by Politico that both he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer had agreed on the need for such a sunset provision - which means NAFTA would automatically end after five years unless renewed - and would \u201cput it forward\u201d in the NAFTA modernization talks, but it was unclear whether Canada and Mexico would back it. U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators are set to reconvene for a third round of talks in Ottawa on Sept. 23-27. Ross said a sunset provision was needed because forecasts for U.S. export and job growth when NAFTA took effect in 1994 were \u201cwildly optimistic\u201d and failed to live up to expectations. Canadian and Mexican ambassadors to Washington pushed back at the idea, saying such a provision would add uncertainty to a NAFTA agreement and affect long-term planning by businesses. \u201cI\u2019m a believer in sunset clauses when things are set up to be temporary,\u201d said Canada\u2019s Ambassador David MacNaughton. \u201cWe can have that discussion but I really do suspect that it won\u2019t be Mexico and Canada pushing back against the secretary, it will be a lot of Americans too.\u201d Mexico\u2019s Ambassador to the United States Ger\u00f3nimo Guti\u00e9rrez Fern\u00e1ndez said a provision \u201cwould have very detrimental consequences to the business sector of the United States, Mexico and Canada.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s look at what they are thinking about in more details but certainty is the key word here,\u201d said Gutierrez.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tax-cut plan will generate growth, but not nearly enough to replace trillions of dollars in lost revenues, while rising deficits could even take back some of the economic gains, fiscal experts said on Wednesday. Core principles of the plan, unveiled on Wednesday, rely heavily on so-called \u201cdynamic scoring,\u201d a budget analysis method that assumes tax cuts will boost economic activity, thus generating more revenues. Such assumptions have been at the heart of Republican tax orthodoxy since Ronald Reagan used them to justify massive tax cuts in 1981 that were derided at the time by critics as \u201cvoodoo economics.\u201d On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump\u2019s plan would \u201cpay for itself with growth\u201d and closing of some deductions and credits.  From the details released so far, Maya MacGuineas, who heads the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), said the plan could add $3 trillion to more than $5 trillion to the federal deficit over five years. \u201cNo credible dynamic score is going to show that this bill is paid for,\u201d MacGuineas said. \u201cThe growth effects, which are real and important, add decimals of percentage points to growth, not full percentage points.\u201d Her budget watchdog group estimates that to pay for the plan, U.S. growth would need to be sustained at 4.5 percent annually, a level not seen on a sustained basis since the late 1960s and early 1970s. Mnuchin has said that he expects the plan to boost sustained U.S. growth above 3 percent, but CRFB estimates that even this level would require massive increases in productivity and that a rapidly retiring baby-boom generation is working against high growth rates. Doug Elmendorf, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, one of the agencies that provides cost estimates for legislation, said he sees little chance of Congress finding \u201cpolitically acceptable\u201d offsets to pay for the plan, and the rise in borrowing could work against Trump\u2019s goals. \u201cThe resulting increase of the deficit will have a dampening effect on the economic activity that will offset at least part of the stimulative effects of lower tax rates,\u201d said Elemendorf, now dean of Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government. The higher federal debt load will \u201ccrowd out\u201d capital for private use, dampening economic activity in the long run, Elmendorf said. Republicans in Congress are hoping to use budget procedural rules that allow a 51-vote threshold in the Senate to pass tax reform, which would limit the cuts to 10 years.  But if the plan creates deficits in the years beyond the first decade, it could also run afoul of another procedural rule that could require 60 votes in the Senate.    Tax cuts that expire in a decade could cause another U.S. fiscal crisis like the one in 2012, when tax cuts passed under George W. Bush expired. \u201cWhat the Trump Administration has proposed is not permanent tax reform, but a ten-year tax cut and the creation of the most phenomenal fiscal cliff ever in 2028,\u201d Chris Krueger, a political analyst at Cowen and Co in Washington, said in a note to clients.

        "title": "After Mugabe, African leaders ponder own fate",
        "text": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - Hours after Zimbabwe s Robert Mugabe was forced out after 37 years in power, Uganda s president, another former guerrilla in office for more than three decades, was tweeting about pay rises for civil servants and bright prospects for his army tank crews.  Supporters of long-serving African leaders dismiss parallels with Zimbabwe, where Mugabe s former deputy - sacked during a power struggle with Mugabe s wife - is about to take power with military and public backing. [nL8N1NS0IR] But Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni s tweets, which come amid rising anger at the 73-year-old s attempts to prolong his rule, suggest he is looking south and wondering about his own fate.  Now that the economic situation in Uganda is improving, the government will be able to look into raising of salaries of soldiers, public servants, health workers and teachers and also deal with institutional housing,  Museveni tweeted on Wednesday. It was unclear what improvement he meant. Uganda s faltering economy is growing too slowly to absorb a booming population of 37 million. The number of citizens spending less than a dollar a day has surged to 27 percent, the statistics office reported in September, up from 20 percent five years ago. Museveni s office was not immediately available for comment on the tweets, but John Baptist Nambeshe, a ruling party lawmaker who opposes the president s attempts to have an age limit on his post lifted, said there was no coincidence.  The timing couldn t have been coincidental. It was to underscore his might, that probably the military is still solidly behind him, unlike in Zimbabwe,  Nambeshe told Reuters. Museveni may not be alone. Several African leaders have faced popular opposition in recent years, from Togo, where thousands protested this autumn, to Gabon, where riots broke out last year after President Ali Bongo was re-elected in a disputed vote.  Mugabe s fall has raised hopes among opposition politicians that other long-serving leaders will fall, but also stoked fears that those who replace them may be no better. President since 1986, Museveni is among Africa s longest-serving leaders. They include Equatorial Guinea s Teodoro Obiang, president for 38 years; Cameroon s Paul Biya, president for 35 years; Congo s Denis Sassou Nguesso, president for two stints totaling 33 years. The Gnassingb  family have ruled Togo and the Bongo family have ruled Gabon for half a century, while the Kabila family have run the Democratic Republic of Congo for 20 years. Some countries allow only two presidential terms, but several have rolled back such legislation.  In Cameroon, Biya scrapped term limits and cracked down on the opposition. In Congo, Nguesso jailed an opposition leader this year for protesting against removal of term limits.  Franck Essi, secretary-general of the opposition Cameroon Peoples  Party, said opposition movements were closely watching events in Zimbabwe.  Leaders must put in place mechanisms for a democratic and peaceful transition that will allow new leadership. If not, sooner or later, the people who are suffocating will wake up,  he said.   Some places have already seen change. Burkina Faso s Blaise Compaore was ousted by protests in 2014 as he tried to change the constitution and extend his decades-long rule. In January, Gambia s erratic ruler Yahya Jammeh fled after regional pressure ended his 22-year reign. Angolan president Jose Eduardo dos Santos stepped down this year after four decades in power; his handpicked successor has pushed out some key dos Santos allies.  For many nations, a Zimbabwe-style switch in the loyalties of the armed forces or a rift in the inner circle represents one of the few ways that rulers might be forced from power. Despite Zimbabwe s well-established opposition, change didn t come until Mugabe s inner circle fell out over his succession plans, and the military put him under house arrest.  Brigitte Adjamagbo-Johnson, a top Togolese opposition official, said they had hoped for a Zimbabwean-type change of power where the military came over to their side.   We d wanted the Togolese army to fight alongside us. We were moved seeing that Zimbabwe s army and civilian population were all in the streets dancing. That s what we want in Togo,  she said.  There will be change in Zimbabwe this year and there will be in Togo too.   A slump in commodities prices has deprived some nations of the resources they have traditionally used to muffle protests. In some cases, corruption has also emptied state coffers.  In central Africa, Congo s Kabila has repeatedly postponed elections after refusing to step down at the end of his term last year, sparking deadly protests. Jean-Pierre Kambila, Kabila s deputy chief of staff, tweeted that Zimbabwe s protests were a colonial fantasy.  A fabricated demonstration dreamed up by those who do not accept the liberation of Africa. Other Mugabes will be born. Nothing to worry about,  he wrote.  Uganda, a key Western ally set to begin exporting its substantial oil reserves, removed term limits in 2005 to extend Museveni s rule.  The east African nation has seen far less violence under Museveni than the two dictators who preceded him. But now tensions are rising as social services crumble and parliamentarians attempt to remove a constitutional age cap that would bar Museveni from standing in the next election. Police have used deadly force against protesters, and repeatedly arrested the main opposition leader. Security forces dragged parliamentarians opposing the bill out of the legislature. On Wednesday, police raided a popular newspaper, detaining eight staff. [nL8N1NS3M0] [nL8N1MV20F] Okello Oryem, Uganda s state minister for foreign affairs, dismissed any parallels with Zimbabwe, saying Mugabe s overthrow was the result of Western interference.   The intelligence services of the West have worked day and night to bring down Zimbabwe,  he told Reuters.  Citizen pressure in Zimbabwe can only work if and when the army allows it.  But another Ugandan opposition leader, Asuman Basalirwa, warned that national leaders who refused to step down risked plunging their countries into conflict. Military intervention to end dictatorships ultimately leads to more repression, he said, something that many feared might be in store for Zimbabwe.   It is time for the continent to democratize,  he said.  Those who have not yet experienced what happened in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and now Zimbabwe should just wait for their turn because it will surely come.   ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee suspended committee rules and confirmed U.S. Representative Tom Price to head the Department of Health and Human Services and banker Steven Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary Wednesday on a straight party line vote, sending the nominations to the Senate floor. Under pressure from their political base to block President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees, Democrats stayed away from the meeting for a second day running. This normally would have stopped action, but Republicans plowed ahead by voting to suspend the rule that required at least one Democrat to be present for business to be conducted. Republican members of the committee, who were all present,  then approved the nominees 14-0. The nominees are considered likely to be confirmed by the Republican-majority Senate. \u201cWe took some unprecedented action today due to some unprecedented obstruction on the part of our colleagues,\u201d said the panel\u2019s chairman, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, who was furious over the Democrats\u2019 no-show. He said he had obtained approval from the Senate parliamentarian for the move suspending the rule. Democrats were also unhappy. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply troubling to me that Republicans on the Finance Committee chose to break the rules in the face of strong evidence of two nominees\u2019 serious ethical problems,\u201d the Finance Committee\u2019s top Democrat, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, said in a statement.  The Democrats said Tuesday they were boycotting Finance Committee proceedings because they wanted more information on Price\u2019s stock trades in an Australian medical company and reports that Mnuchin\u2019s former bank, OneWest, used automated \u201crobo-signings\u201d of foreclosure documents, which apparently contradicted statements the nominees had made to senators. Senate Democrats on Wednesday boycotted another committee vote on Trump\u2019s pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who has expressed doubts about the science of climate change. That session ended without any committee action. Republicans accused the Democrats of deliberately stalling the functions of Trump\u2019s new administration. \u201cThey (the Democrats) had tons of information (about Price and Mnuchin),\u201d Hatch said. \u201cIt\u2019s another way of roughing up the president and his choice of nominees.\u201d But Democrats have come under pressure from liberal activists who want them to counter Trump at every turn, especially after his order last week blocking immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. It sparked a wave of protests in major U.S. cities.  One group that has been running television ads against Mnuchin blasted Republicans for the vote.  \u201cSteven Mnuchin is such an illegitimate, compromised nominee that Republicans had to change the rules to force through his nomination,\u201d said Kait Sweeney, press secretary of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.

        "title": "U.S. can still hit climate goals despite Supreme Court pause, White House says",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House vowed Wednesday that the United States would still meet international commitments to cut carbon emissions, seeking to allay concerns that the Supreme Court might take away one of its main weapons against climate change.   The court dealt a blow on Tuesday to the Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which would steer electricity plants away from burning coal to cleaner fuel sources, delaying its implementation until all legal challenges are decided.  But the White House said it remained confident it would ultimately win the lawsuits brought by industry groups and 29 states opposed to the plan.  And White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the administration has an array of tools available to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to rising global temperatures. He cited the long-term extension of tax credits for renewable energy that were enacted in last year\u2019s budget deal as an example of other policy measures driving the power sector\u2019s shift to cleaner energy. \u201cThe inclusion of those tax credits is going to have more impact over the short term than the Clean Power Plan,\u201d Schultz said. Still, the court-ordered pause that could push a final legal ruling back a year or more and onto the desk of the next president raised questions about the U.S. ability to deliver on pledges made at December\u2019s Paris climate talks.  The Paris accord requires countries to set and meet their own national targets to reduce carbon emissions, and the United States presented the Clean Power Plan as a major step to shrink power plant emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels over the next 15 years.  The prospect of a legal delay and possible rejection of the plan rattled some environmental groups and foreign governments that have embraced the Paris formula. Outgoing French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who was praised for his smooth chairmanship that brought about a deal in Paris, was quoted by French government officials saying the Supreme Court\u2019s move was \u201cnot good news.\u201d But other observers, noting the endemic gyrations of global climate politics over the past two decades, warned against panic over the court\u2019s move. \u201cNo country naively made an agreement with the United States on the basis of one or two of its policies,\u201d said Robert Orr, special adviser on climate change to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \u201cThe Paris agreement wasn\u2019t about what commitments were extracted from one country and whether they can be lived up to,\u201d Orr said. \u201cIt was a recognition by all the major countries that it is in their own best interest to solve this problem.\u201d Michelle Patron, formerly a top adviser to Obama\u2019s National Security Council on energy and climate issues, said she expected other signatories to the climate deal to take the U.S. news in stride. \u201cOur partners are well aware of the legal tests and hurdles that our policies now have to go through, and they\u2019ve seen it before,\u201d Patron said, describing climate diplomats as having a \u201csophisticated\u201d level of knowledge about the U.S. political system. Market reaction seemed to reflect a similar long view. Coal companies have blamed clean air regulations for the collapse of much of the domestic industry in recent years, even though much of the power sector\u2019s shift from coal to natural gas has been driven by low prices for the latter.  Coal stocks rose quickly in early trading Wednesday after the court\u2019s move. But after jumping nearly 7 percent early in the session, the Thomson Reuters U.S. coal index was down 3 percent in afternoon trading, reflecting the deeply ingrained skepticism about the long-term prospects for coal. \u201cWhenever you get a rally in these stocks initially it\u2019s from short-covering that helps propel the stock,\u201d said King Lip, chief investment officer at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. \u201cBut people start realizing it\u2019s still very difficult for a lot of these companies because they\u2019re so leveraged. They come back to Earth and the selling starts to pick up again. That\u2019s what you saw today with some of these coal stocks.\u201d ",

        "text": "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani anti-corruption court on Thursday indicted ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter over allegations linked to ownership of London properties, opening a trial that could see the former leader jailed. The Sharifs have called the corruption proceedings against them a conspiracy, hinting at intervention by the powerful military, but opponents have hailed it as a rare example of the rich and powerful being held accountable.  Sharif, 67, resigned in July after the Supreme Court disqualified him from holding office over an undeclared source of income, but the veteran leader maintains his grip on the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party. Sharif said there was no precedent for indicting someone in his absence.  I hope I will get justice,  he told reporters in London in remarks broadcast by local Geo TV, adding that he would travel home to attend the next court hearing.  Judge Bashir Ahmad of the court that tries cases registered and investigated by an anti-graft body, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), indicted Sharif, his daughter Maryam Sharif and her husband, Muhammad Safdar. They all pleaded not guilty.  Maryam and Safdar were present in court, but Sharif, who was prime minister twice in the 1990s, sent a representative while he tends to his wife as she undergoes cancer treatment in Britain.  Maryam said in the court that the charges were unfounded and baseless.  This will go down in history as a travesty of justice,  she said. Outside the court, Maryam again hinted at military interference in the judicial process by saying the trial was  a repeat of 1999 , the year her father was toppled in a military coup led by former army chief Pervez Musharraf. It is not clear if she was comparing the trial to the coup, or subsequent corruption accusations and investigations that Musharraf ordered into Sharif. Sharif s disqualification stemmed from the Panama Papers leaks in 2016 that appeared to show that his daughter and two sons owned offshore holding companies registered in the British Virgin Islands and used them to buy posh flats in London. The Supreme Court initially declined to dismiss Sharif but ordered an investigation into his family s wealth.  A separate Supreme Court-appointed panel said the family s wealth did not match its income, and accused Maryam and her brothers of signing forged documents to obscure ownership of offshore companies used to buy the London flats.  After the probe, the top court disqualified Sharif and ordered the NAB to investigate and conduct a trial. Sharif denies ever receiving the small source of income that led to his disqualification.  The NAB has in the past been described as toothless because of its low conviction rates, especially when it comes to powerful politicians, and investigations that last many years. But the Supreme Court has ordered the trial to be concluded within six months.    Opening arguments are due to begin on Oct. 26. ",

        "title": "Climate advocates study industry lobby's playbook to fight Trump",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Scientists may steal a page from the oil industry\u2019s playbook to stop President Donald Trump rewriting the U.S. position on climate change, by relying on an obscure law meant to ensure federal agencies present accurate information. The 2001 Information Quality Act, passed under Republican President George W. Bush, has for years provided a way for companies and their lobbyists to challenge federal agencies\u2019 assumptions on issues ranging from the threats posed by global warming to the health effects of petrochemicals. Now, as Trump\u2019s leadership seeks to get the Environmental Protection Agency into line with the new administration\u2019s more pro-business and anti-regulation agenda, the act could become a tool for rebellious scientists and climate advocates, legal experts said. Trump has expressed doubts about the science behind climate change, putting his administration on a collision course with an overwhelming majority of scientists who believe that human consumption of fossil fuels is warming the planet and triggering sea level rise and more frequent powerful storms. A spokesman for Trump\u2019s EPA said last week that the agency\u2019s website is under review, raising worries of a rewrite that could put the site at odds with EPA employees\u2019 own research. A Trump administration official did not respond to a request for comment. \u201cPosting blatantly false information on the EPA\u2019s website would violate the Information Quality Act,\u201d said Romany Webb, a climate law fellow at Columbia University. \u201cThe guidelines clearly state that information disseminated to the public, including via a website, must be substantively accurate.\u201d Michael Halpern, deputy director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit climate science advocacy group, said the Information Quality Act could be one of the options scientists consider using to ensure federal agencies match scientific research. The Information Quality Act allows individuals who object to information presented by a federal agency to request a correction. If the agency denies the request, the individual can appeal in a process overseen by an independent inspector general. In the case of the EPA, the appeal would go to a panel of political appointees \u2013 who will likely be named after Trump\u2019s pick to head the EPA, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, is confirmed. The EPA\u2019s Inspector General, however, is already in place: Arthur Elkins, a former EPA lawyer appointed by Barack Obama in 2010. \u201cWe have discretionary authority to look at anything we think is important and valuable to the agency\u2019s activities,\u201d Alan Larsen, counsel to the Inspector General, told Reuters. \u201cIf employees were asked to do something improper ... they could bring that to the IG\u2019s office.\u201d The Washington Post reported this week that a member of the Trump transition team had sent an email stating inspectors general across federal agencies were being held over on a \u201ctemporary basis.\u201d After some backlash, Trump transition team members then sought to reassure the inspectors general they would not be forced out, the Post reported. There are other ways employees can flag their concerns, including by complaining to the agency\u2019s\u00a0Scientific Integrity Officer. The Scientific Integrity Office meets quarterly with the Inspector General\u2019s office to discuss complaints. Industry\u2019s use of the Information Quality Act over the years has had mixed results. Just five of the 20 requests for correction filed in 2014 ended up fully or partially corrected, according to a report to Congress. Halpern said, however, that he expected better results if scientists file complaints rather than industry.  Overruling a correction request brought by scientists within the agency, he said, could violate the EPA\u2019s scientific integrity policy, which states agency scientists have the right of last review over information that relies on their expertise. A former EPA official who asked not to be named said that, under normal circumstances, the internal mechanisms to protect website accuracy should work, but added \u201cwe\u2019re in uncharted territory.\u201d",

        "title": "Jared Kushner details Russia contacts, denies collusion",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, emerged from behind the scenes on Monday to tell Senate investigators he had no part in any Kremlin attempt to meddle in the U.S. election despite having met Russians four times last year. \u201cAll of my actions were proper and occurred in the normal course of events of a very unique campaign,\u201d Kushner later told  reporters outside the White House. \u201cI did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did.\u201d Kushner, 36, a senior White House adviser, met Senate Intelligence Committee staff behind closed doors for about two hours. Two sources with knowledge of what Kushner told them said the session was pleasant and conversational. In an 11-page written statement Kushner made public before the meeting, the real estate businessman portrayed himself as new to politics when he became a top adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. The letter was his fullest account to date of contacts with Russian officials. A businessman married to Trump\u2019s eldest daughter Ivanka Trump, Kushner has rarely spoken in public since his father-in-law launched his presidential campaign in mid-2015. \u201cI am not a person who has sought the spotlight,\u201d he wrote in the letter. Trump prevailed over his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in November 2016 because he ran a \u201csmarter campaign\u201d and to suggest otherwise \u201cridicules those who voted for him,\u201d Kushner said at the White House. He took no questions. The congressional committee is one of several investigating the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, engaged in a hacking and propaganda campaign to try to tilt the November election in Trump\u2019s favor. Russia denies the accusation and Trump denies his campaign colluded with Moscow. Special counsel Robert Mueller is leading a separate probe into the Russia matter.  A steady drip of information, much of it leaked to the news media, about contacts that Trump aides had with Russians has raised questions about possible collusion with Moscow, viewed by many of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans and rival Democrats as a hostile power trying to undermine U.S. interests around the world. Trump, who has called the Russia probes politically motivated, lashed out at the investigations in Twitter messages on Monday.  Kushner did not initially disclose any meetings with Russians on forms he filed to get a government security clearance for his work in the White House. He has since revised those forms several times. According to the sources with knowledge of Monday\u2019s meeting, Kushner told the investigators that his lawyers and staff had not handled his security clearance form properly but they informed the FBI immediately when they realized it had been sent before it was complete, and then submitted a complete version. He said in his written statement that the initial form omitted not just Russian contacts but also all foreign contacts. In his written statement Kushner said he first met Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak in Washington in April 2016 and they shook hands.  He said that in a Dec. 1 meeting with Kislyak, the Russian ambassador asked if there was a secure line in Trump\u2019s transition office to facilitate a discussion with Russian generals about Syria, and Kushner replied there was not.  Kushner said he asked if there was an existing communications channel at the Russian Embassy that could be used, but Kislyak said that was not possible and they agreed to follow up after the inauguration. \u201cNothing else occurred. I did not suggest a \u2018secret back channel,\u2019\u201d Kushner said. Kushner said he met on Dec. 13, with Sergei Gorkov, the head of Russian state-owned Vnesheconombank, because of Kislyak\u2019s insistence and because the Russian had a \u201cdirect relationship\u201d with Putin. \u201cHe introduced himself and gave me two gifts - one was a piece of art from Nvgorod, the village where my grandparents were from in Belarus, and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village,\u201d Kushner said. He said that neither sanctions imposed by Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration nor Kushner\u2019s business activities were discussed. Vnesheconombank has been subjected to U.S. economic sanctions since mid-2014 over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Relations between the United States and Russia deteriorated under Obama and Trump has said he wants to improve ties with Moscow, at times expressing admiration for Putin. U.S. lawmakers have said they want to hear about a June 2016 meeting involving Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. The younger Trump has released emails that showed he welcomed the prospect of receiving damaging information from the Russian government about Clinton. Kushner and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort were also at the meeting but Kushner described it as a waste of time and said there was no discussion about the campaign during the time he was there. \u201cI actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote \u2018Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting.\u2019\u201d Kushner is scheduled to address the House intelligence panel on Tuesday. ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Connecticut will cancel pay raises for managers at state agencies after the latest projections suggest the state\u2019s fiscal situation may be much worse than previously thought, top officials said on Monday. The canceled raises are an early indication of the harm done by the state\u2019s fiscal crisis. Many more cuts are expected this year as officials struggle with a budget deficit that could be as high as $900 million in the coming fiscal year. Although high-profile, the amounts involved are largely symbolic. The cancellations will affect 1,950 employees and represent savings of $12.74 million over two years. The figure does not include pay freezes in the judicial branch.  Connecticut has had to slash its revenue forecast because the weak stock market is cutting into capital gains tax receipts, which play a large role in the budget. It also met resistance when it tried to raise taxes. General Electric moved its headquarters out of the state earlier this year.   \u201cWe have a responsibility to the taxpayers of Connecticut not to move forward with managerial raises at a time when so many state programs will see reductions and while many state jobs are likely to be eliminated,\u201d wrote Ben Barnes, secretary of the Office of Policy and Management. The letter was co-signed by Brian Durand, chief of staff to Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy. A report last week from the non-partisan Office of Fiscal Management said the deficit could be as high as $900 million in the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1. An earlier estimate from Barnes\u2019 office put the deficit at $570 million.    Most of the raises, which have already been postponed twice, would have been awarded on Friday.

        "title": "Exclusive: U.S. envoys told to be coy on re-engaging in Paris climate deal - cable",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. diplomats should sidestep questions from foreign governments on what it would take for the Trump administration to re-engage in the global Paris climate agreement, according to a diplomatic cable seen by Reuters. The cable, sent by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to embassies on Friday, also said diplomats should make clear the United States wants to help other countries use fossil fuels. In the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement in June that the United States would withdraw from the accord, the cable tells diplomats to expect foreign government representatives to ask questions like: \u201cDoes the United States have a climate change policy?\u201d and \u201cIs the administration advocating the use of fossil fuels over renewable energy?\u201d If asked, for example, \u201cWhat is the process for consideration of re-engagement in the Paris Agreement?\u201d, the answer should be vague: \u201cWe are considering a number of factors. I do not have any information to share on the nature or timing of the process,\u201d the cable advises.  A U.S. State Department official declined to comment on the cable. (Click here for a link to the cable: here ) Trump, a Republican, had campaigned on a promise to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris deal, saying he believed it would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars while leaving developing nations such as China unfettered. In a sharp difference with the previous administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, Trump has several times called climate change a hoax. In June, Trump left the door open to re-engagement if terms improved. The United States will \u201cstart to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that\u2019s fair,\u201d he said. The State Department guidance clarifies that right now, \u201cthere are no plans to seek to re-negotiate or amend the text of the Paris Agreement.\u201d But it adds: \u201cThe President is sincere in his commitment to look for a path to re-engage that takes into account his concerns for U.S. economic growth and energy security.\u201d    The Paris accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, seeks to limit planetary warming by curbing global emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists believe drive global warming. The United States, under the Obama administration, had promised to cut emissions as much as 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.  Separate from the diplomatic cable, the Trump administration is reviewing a draft report written by scientists across 13 federal government agencies that shows the effects of climate change pose dire, near-term threats to the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment on the draft, which The New York Times published on Monday. The report puts the White House in the awkward position of either clearing the report\u2019s findings or editing them.  The diplomatic guidance makes clear that the United States intends to attend global climate summits during the prolonged process of withdrawing from the Paris deal to protect U.S. interests. The next summit is in November.  A U.S. official said a major priority in these talks would be to beat back attempts to have separate standards in the guidance on emissions cuts for rich and poor nations - long a sticking point in negotiations. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly nothing in the policies of this administration that would make us think that we should be acting differently,\u201d the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal memo.  The cable also anticipates questions over why the United States has changed its policy to make it easier for global development banks such as the World Bank to finance coal-fired power projects. In 2013 the Obama administration said the United States would oppose most coal projects, guidance since altered by the Trump administration.  \u201cThe new principles will allow the (United States) the flexibility to approve, as appropriate, a broad range of power projects, including the generation of power using clean and efficient fossil fuels and renewable energy,\u201d the cable said.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday denied that he is preparing for a presidential election run in 2020, saying the suggestion is \u201cdisgraceful and offensive.\u201d  Pence was responding to a New York Times report that some Republicans were moving to form a \u201cshadow campaign\u201d as though President Donald Trump were not involved. It said multiple advisers to Pence \u201chave already intimated to party donors that he would plan to run if Mr. Trump did not.\u201d The report said Pence had not only kept a full political calendar but also had created his own independent power base, including a political fund-raising group called the \u201cGreat America Committee.\u201d But Pence called the article \u201cfake news\u201d and said his entire team was focused on advancing Trump\u2019s agenda and seeing him re-elected in 2020.  \u201cThe allegations in this article are categorically false and represent just the latest attempt by the media to divide this Administration,\u201d Pence said in a statement. The Times stood by its coverage. \u201cWe are confident in the accuracy of our reporting and will let the story speak for itself,\u201d New York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said in an email. Pence has good relations with conservative political groups and some of the Republican Party\u2019s big donors, including billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.  He is also a Trump loyalist, and there is typically little distinction between his public statements and the policies of the president. But as investigations deepen into Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible ties to members of Trump\u2019s campaign, Pence has put some distance between himself and the president on the best way to approach Moscow.  On a trip to Eastern Europe last week, Pence condemned Russia\u2019s presence in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, with which Moscow fought a brief war in 2008. He also said ties with Russia would not improve until Moscow changed its stance on Ukraine and withdrew support for countries like Iran, Syria and North Korea.

        "title": "Louisiana governor urges tax hike, tapping reserves to fix budget gap",
        "text": "(Reuters) - Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards on Tuesday urged state legislators to approve a plan to increase taxes and tap reserves to plug the largest budget shortfall in state history. Louisiana faces a projected shortfall of $750 million this fiscal year and the gap is expected to grow to $1.9 billion in the next fiscal year beginning July 1 from deteriorating tax revenues and a drop in oil prices. Edwards, a Democrat who took office earlier this month, wants to add 1 cent to the state\u2019s existing 4-cent sales tax, excluding the purchase of groceries, prescription drugs and residential utilities. The proposed measure is expected to raise $216 million by late June. The plan also taps $128 million from the state\u2019s rainy day fund and $200 million paid by Plc to reimburse cleanup efforts following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The state would also cut some discretionary funding. If enacted, the governor\u2019s plan would reduce but not eliminate the deficits the state faces. \u201cThe days of using budget gimmicks that helped us limp along are over,\u201d said Edwards, the first Democrat to hold the office of governor in Louisiana since 2008. \u201cThis administration will remove the smoke and mirrors and provide the facts of where we are and where we are going.\u201d Edwards warned that if leaders did not act quickly, universities could struggle, distressed hospitals could close, and public education could suffer severe cuts. \u201cRaising taxes is not my first, second, or even third option when seeking to fill the state\u2019s budget shortfall,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cUnfortunately, those cuts will not be enough to bridge the enormous shortfall we face today.\u201d The state\u2019s overall budget problems stem from the drop in oil prices, but much of the shortfall also comes from previous excessive use of one-time money and lower-than-expected revenues, the governor\u2019s office reported. Louisiana is now contending with years of unresolved structural budget deficits that have collided with a weakening state economy and a sharp drop in revenues from oil and gas extraction taxes, Moody\u2019s Investors Services said in December. Moody\u2019s rates Louisiana Aa2 with a negative outlook. During Edwards\u2019 inaugural address last week, he pledged to  begin accepting federal funding to expand healthcare to residents through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. ",

        "text": "AACHEN, Germany (Reuters) - Social Democrat Martin Schulz on Saturday read out a message he received via Facebook from a young Syrian migrant who called on Germans to exercise their right to vote in Sunday s national election. In an open letter to the German people, Abdul Abbasi, a translator at a migrant legal clinic in Goettingen, talked of watching friends killed before his eyes while participating in pro-democracy demonstrations in Syria in 2012, Schulz said.  Their goals and desires were things that are considered normal in Germany in 2017. They died because they wanted to live as free people ... they wanted the right to participate in the politics of their country,  Abbasi wrote.  The ability to vote and live in a democratic country is a dream of many in this world,  he said.  Go vote and protect your democracy, protect us from people who divide us into categories, fight against our ability to live together and want to divide the society.  Abbasi was not immediately available to comment. His Facebook profile said he was from Aleppo, Syria, and was studying dentistry at the University of Goettingen. Schulz said the letter underscored the importance of voting at a time when the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is poised to become the first far-right party in the Bundestag since the end of World War Two. Abbasi posted the open letter in response to a Facebook posting in which Schulz called the AfD  a danger to our democracy  and said it  has no business being in parliament . Founded in 2013 to oppose large bailouts of financially strapped euro zone countries, the AfD has gained popular support after Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2015 opened the doors to about a million migrants. It is now polling around 13 percent.  What a wonderful letter, and what a challenge for us,  Schulz told thousands of supporters gathered for his final campaign appearance. With support of around 21 percent, the SPD is running far behind Merkel s conservatives in the polls, which are at 34 percent. Electoral arithmetic might yet force Merkel to renew her coalition with the SPD, or she might opt for a three-way alliance with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and environmental Greens. ",

        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - The wife of British aristocrat Lord Lucan, who vanished without trace 43 years ago after the murder of his children s nanny, has been found dead, London police said on Wednesday. The mystery of what happened to Richard Lucan, a dapper, moustachioed lord known as  Lucky , has fascinated the public for decades and speculation about his whereabouts has long been a staple of the British press. Lord Lucan disappeared hours after nanny Sandra Rivett was found bludgeoned to death in his house in central London in 1974. A car he was using was later found on the south English coast with a length of lead piping. It was alleged the peer had mistaken the nanny for his estranged wife Veronica, who was also attacked and fled to a nearby pub covered in blood to raise the alarm. She later identified her husband as the assailant. Police said on Wednesday they had found the body of 80-year-old Lady Lucan after forcing entry to a house in the upmarket Belgravia area of London.  The death is being treated as unexplained but is not believed to be suspicious,  police said. Over the years, the British press have reported supposed sightings of Lord Lucan across the world, including in Australia, India, the Netherlands and South Africa   but his relatives believe him to be dead. The London High Court declared him dead in 1999 and last year a judge issued a death certificate allowing his son George Bingham to inherit his title.  My own personal view, and it was one I took I think as an eight-year-old boy, is he s unfortunately been dead since that time (of his disappearance),  Bingham said last year. One of numerous theories about what became of Lucan, who would now be 82, was that he shot himself and was then fed to tigers at the zoo of his friend John Aspinall. Aspinall himself said in 2000 that Lucan had weighted himself down with a stone and drowned himself in the English Channel. ",

        "text": "BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand bade a final goodbye to its beloved late King Bhumibol Adulyadej on Thursday in a ceremony steeped in ancient rituals, processions and Buddhist rites that drew hundreds of thousands of mourners. Despite heavy downpours, black-clad mourners crowded Bangkok s historic quarter where the king s cremation took place. The $90 million funeral marks the end of an era for many Thais who had only ever known King Bhumibol as their monarch. It ushers in the reign of the late king s son King Maha Vajiralongkorn, or Rama X, who ascended the throne last year but whose coronation can only take place after his father s funeral. King Vajiralongkorn has overseen sweeping changes to the royal household, including the running of palace finances. Earlier in the day members of the Thai royal family, visiting dignitaries and government officials placed sandalwood flowers at the royal funeral pyre. The cremation of King Bhumibol began with Buddhist religious rites and ceremonial candle-lighting by saffron-robed monks. Many of those lining the Thai capital s streets had slept overnight on pavements near the Grand Palace to capture vantage spots for the funeral procession that wended past buildings draped in yellow marigolds.  This is the last goodbye,  said one tearful visitor, Pimsupak Suthin, 42, who traveled from the northern province of Nan to attend the function.  I really love and miss him. It is very difficult to describe.  King Bhumibol, also known as King Rama IX, died last October aged 88 after ruling for seven decades. He played a pivotal role in maintaining stability during years of political upheaval and rapid development. At the start of the ceremony, officials dressed in blue and orange removed a symbolic golden urn from the Dusit Maha Prasart Throne Hall and carried it through the streets to a 50-metre (165-foot) -high royal crematorium in a nearby square.  The king s body was moved to the cremation area on Wednesday night from the palace, where it had been lying in state since his death.  New King Maha Vajiralongkorn presided over religious chanting in the afternoon prior to the cremation at the royal crematorium, which features nine spires to mark the reign of his father, the ninth member of Thailand s Chakri Dynasty. One of the late king s daughters, Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, lit candles inside the crematorium. Thailand s supreme patriarch, Somdet Phra Maha Muniwong, led the religious ceremony, urging Thais to follow Buddhist teachings and  look beyond sadness . Royals from Bhutan, Britain, Japan, Lesotho, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden, among others, attended the funeral ceremony on Thursday. Performances   including the Thai Khon masked dance   punctuated the evening and added a festive air to an otherwise somber day.  Officials in charge of the ceremony said about 110,000 people had gathered near the cremation area, with 200,000 more nearby. The realisation of the king s departure was now sinking in, said funeral ceremony volunteer Petchpailin Jaidee, 60.   The cremation makes it real,  she added.  I feel like he is truly gone, and it feels like the sky is falling.  A sum of $90 million has been set aside for the funeral, the likes of which has never been seen in Thailand, officials have said, even though King Bhumibol was portrayed as a frugal man despite being one of the world s wealthiest monarchs. Elsewhere in the Thai capital and around the country, 85 smaller replicas of the royal crematorium and more than 870 pavilions were built for mourners to lay sandalwood flowers and pay their final respects. Sites to offer sandalwood flowers were also set up in 94 countries to give overseas Thais a chance to say good-bye. Some onlookers clutched pictures of the late king and several prostrated themselves as the urn passed by.  I was very fortunate to have been born under the reign of King Rama IX,  said Piyamat Potsopho, 38, adding that she had waited for the funeral procession since Wednesday night. In Nonthaburi province north of Bangkok, a long queue of black-clad mourners waited to place sandalwood flowers in a mark of respect, as volunteers handed out food. Analysts say the king s death has left a large vacuum in the Thai psyche. King Bhumibol is often referred to as  father  by Thais and is credited with reviving the popularity of the monarchy. Days of heavy rain failed to deter mourners, many of whom pitched tents to secure the best access to the funeral. Many businesses around the Southeast Asian nation were shut, while Bangkok s old quarter was draped in garlands of flowers. Some government buildings placed potted marigolds around the  portraits of the king. King Bhumibol was born on a Monday, a day that Thais associate with the color yellow. The king s ashes and bones will be collected in an early morning ceremony on Friday. (For a graphic on 'Thai King's Funeral' click tmsnrt.rs/2leWzcQ) ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cuba will make it easier for its U.S.-based citizens to travel to the island, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said on Saturday, in a gesture to win support from Cuban Americans during a diplomatic crisis over allegations of mysterious health attacks.  The U.S. government closes, and Cuba opens,  Rodriguez told a meeting of pro-Havana Cuban Americans in Washington. He said Cuban citizens in the United States would no longer need to have a special review of their Cuban passports to rehabilitate them before traveling to the island.  Rodriguez said that procedure had become more difficult due to staff shortages at the Cuban embassy after the U.S. government expelled 15 Cuban diplomats this month due to the dispute over the mystery attacks on U.S. personnel in Cuba.  It s unacceptable and immoral, from the point of view of the Cuban government, for people to be harmed by a difference between governments,  he said.  Some Cuban Americans said Havana was simply acceding to demands that it should have acceded to long ago, like allowing them home without a special procedure.  While the United States has not formally accused Cuba of carrying out what it says are attacks that have caused hearing loss and cognitive issues in its diplomats, President Donald Trump said last week Havana was responsible. Cuban government officials accused Trump this week of slandering their country. Tension over the alleged attacks, some of which involved high-pitched sounds, came after Trump said in June he wanted to partially roll back the historic detente between the United States and Cuba, ordering tighter restrictions on travel and trade. These have yet to be unveiled. Rodriguez said Cuba was making it easier for the children of Cubans in the United States to attain Cuban nationality and allowing Cuban Americans to travel to the country on cruise ships that embark at two ports on Cuba. Havana will also allow some Cubans who left the country illegally to return, he said.             There are roughly 2 million Cubans or Americans of Cuban origin in the United States. One attendee at the event, Andres Pertierra, a U.S.-born citizen with a Cuban father, said he was excited he now qualified for a Cuban passport.   These changes inspire gratitude and bring Cubans abroad closer to Cuban government,  said the legal assistant.  The Cuban government is making sure that it is clear that the weight of responsibility for failure to normalize falls squarely on the shoulders of the Trump administration.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. consumer financial watchdog on Thursday attempted to repel a Trump-administration attack on former President Barack Obama\u2019s sweeping student loan reforms and defended itself against Republican attempts to weaken its powers. In a lengthy letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said it had complied with its remit, despite her department\u2019s charges to the contrary. The Education Department announced last week it would no longer work with the bureau on resolving student loan complaints, saying it had complicated the lending process \u201cwith potentially inaccurate and inconsistent directives.\u201d  It said the consumer bureau, created after the 2007-09 financial crisis to protect individuals from predatory lending, was not honoring an agreement to promptly refer complaints to the department, but using the department\u2019s data \u201cto expand its jurisdiction into areas that Congress never envisioned.\u201d  The Obama-appointed head of the watchdog, Democrat Richard Cordray, said the bureau shares complaint information in \u201cnear real-time\u201d through an on-line portal with the department. It has \u201cnot exceeded its authority,\u201d and only fulfilled its mission under federal law to monitor and respond to individuals\u2019 complaints about debts as well as enforce federal consumer law, Cordray wrote.  Congress created the bureau in part to mediate between consumers and credit card companies, banks, mortgage providers and other lenders. The dispute goes beyond a mere territory fight. Republicans revile the CFPB, saying it reaches too far in its rules and enforcement and should be more accountable to lawmakers. Democrats have said it helps ensure fair treatment for middle-class people unable to fight fraud on their own.  Republicans also disapprove of Obama\u2019s attempt to make college more affordable by moving almost all of the $1.4 trillion student-loan industry into the federal government. Currently, only servicing is handled outside the Education Department.  During last year\u2019s elections, Trump and fellow Republicans promised to \u201cget government out of the business of lending\u201d and DeVos is now working to return much of the process to the private sector. She also wants to redo other Obama-era regulations, such as protections for sexual-assault victims on college campuses. DeVos critics consider the department\u2019s split from the CFPB as a way to protect for-profit schools, debt collectors and servicers from government intervention. Earlier this year the bureau, which has received nearly 20,000 complaints about student loan servicers since February 2016, sued the country\u2019s largest servicer Navient Corp for systematically failing borrowers. Navient disputes the allegations and is contesting them in court.  ",

Some 77 percent of them think the country is on the \u201cwrong track,\u201d which puts them more in line with Trump supporters than Clinton backers. They are also similar in age to many Trump backers: some 54 percent are at least 55 years old. And 67 percent never earned a college degree, compared with 71 percent for Trump supporters and 56 percent for Clinton supporters. Gender-wise, they track more closely with Clinton\u2019s base. Some 60 percent are women. Trump\u2019s base is made up of about 48 percent women, compared with 52 percent for Clinton. The most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found Clinton leading Trump by 4 percentage points in a two-way race. The Democratic nominee has mostly led Trump in the poll this year, but the gap between the two candidates has narrowed with six weeks left before the Nov. 8 election.  With neither candidate a clear favorite on issues like creating jobs or keeping the nation safe, nearly a third of uncommitted voters said they may be more likely to vote for a third-party candidate than for either Clinton or Trump. \u201cOne of the most important issues in this election is just making sure that our country has a future both through education and jobs,\u201d said undecided voter Erika Szotek, 43, of Hanover Park, Illinois, who voted for Romney in 2012. She said she thought Trump\u2019s \u201cflamboyancy is going to get the country into a lot of trouble with other countries.\u201d But she isn\u2019t sold on Clinton either. \u201cThere are some things I just don\u2019t trust about her.\u201d  Women have been a lingering problem for Trump, whose unfiltered speaking style and fiery rhetoric on immigration and security have put many off. He has also gotten into trouble for some remarks he has made about women. He was widely criticized for saying Fox News host Megyn Kelly had \u201cblood coming out of her wherever,\u201d a comment many interpreted as referring to her menstruating, although he insisted that was not what he meant.  He has also called television personality Rosie O\u2019Donnell a \u201cfat pig\u201d and made fun of former presidential rival and ex-Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina\u2019s face, saying, \u201cWould anyone vote for that?\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign has seized on the vulnerability. This week it launched an ad titled \u201cMirrors\u201d that shows images of girls looking in mirrors while recordings of Trump comment on women\u2019s weight and breast size, calling them \u201cslob,\u201d \u201cpig,\u201d and \u201cfat.\u201d   But Clinton has her own troubles. Multiple polls show that her use of a private email server without approval while secretary of state has deepened voters\u2019 mistrust of her even though she has since acknowledged it was a mistake. Trump frequently calls her \u201cCrooked Hillary.\u201d FBI director James Comey recommended in July that no criminal charges be brought against Clinton for her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state, but he called her use of the server \u201cextremely careless.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ruth Hammett, 77, of Kingsland, Georgia, said she would be looking to the debates for guidance on which candidate to support. She is leaning toward Clinton but wants to hear both candidates address national security.  \u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m very scared, most so for my kids and my grandkids,\u201d Hammett said. \u201cI\u2019m scared to death.\u201d ",

        "text": "TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Thousands of Israelis protested in Tel Aviv on Saturday for the second consecutive week against government corruption and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under criminal investigation over allegations of abuse of office. Police estimated the number of demonstrators at about 10,000 and they followed last Saturday s demonstration, which was by far the largest of the recent weekly anti-corruption protests when an estimated 20,000 people participated. The protests have been sparked by corruption allegations against Netanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing. The four-term leader is suspected of involvement in two cases.  The first involves receiving gifts from wealthy businessmen and the second involves negotiating a deal with a newspaper owner for better coverage in return for curbs on a rival daily. If charged, he would come under heavy pressure to resign or could call an election to test whether he still had a mandate to govern. Netanyahu s right-wing Likud party said in a Facebook post that the protest was a left-wing demonstration. It called on all Israelis to back their prime minister as he defends Israel against international criticism following U.S. President Donald Trump s acceptance of Jerusalem as Israel s capital.  Instead of uniting with all the people behind Jerusalem and showing the world a unified front, the left cannot contain itself and it prefers to create division,  part of the statement said. Over weeks of demonstrations, protesters have identified themselves as supporting both left- and right-wing parties. On Saturday they held banners reading:  Neither left, nor right (we demand) integrity,   We are fed up with corrupt (politicians)  and  Sweep the corrupt away.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department will not conduct its regular daily press briefing until a new secretary of state is confirmed, leaving the main U.S. agency responsible for dealing with the rest of the world silent amid the uproar over President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration. Trump on Friday announced a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and a temporary bar on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. The decision provoked a widespread backlash in foreign capitals, documented in cables U.S. embassies sent to Washington. Typically, in the aftermath of a major foreign policy shift, a State Department spokesperson would appear on camera within days to take questions from reporters and defend or explain the U.S. positions on different issues. The State Department has not briefed since the day before Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration, however, and on Monday a department spokesperson said no one will appear at the podium until the U.S. Senate confirms a new secretary of state. \u201cAt that point, we will update the press corps on our posture,\u201d the spokesperson said. Trump\u2019s desire to break with previous U.S. policies on issues including Israel\u2019s construction of settlements, U.S. trade pacts, and cooperation with Russia suggests that State Department officials have not been given guidance on what positions they should articulate.     \u201cUntil you know what policy you\u2019re advancing, it doesn\u2019t do you any good to get out there,\u201d said Richard Boucher, a former State Department spokesman who briefed reporters on the first weekday of the George W. Bush administration, in January 2001. \u201cThe decision not to brief is a simple admission that they don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d The Senate is due to vote on Monday on moving forward on confirming Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil Corp executive whom Trump has tapped to lead the State Department.   If as expected the Senate votes to advance his nomination, a final confirmation vote would most likely take place late on Tuesday. The lack of briefings this far into a new administration is a departure from the three previous inter-party transitions. In 1993, 2001, and 2009, State Department spokespeople briefed reporters no later than Jan. 23, according to briefing transcripts stored in online archives. In those three transitions, the new secretary of state was confirmed on or just after Jan. 20. ",

Both sides accused the other of starting the fighting around the town of Koch in Unity state. Seventeen aid workers fled the violence, according to a humanitarian source. There were no immediate details of casualties. The government and rebel groups signed a ceasefire on Thursday in the latest attempt to end a four-year civil war and let humanitarian groups reach civilians. The ceasefire formally came into force on Sunday morning, but fighting broke out soon afterwards, according to a humanitarian security report seen by Reuters.   Our forces came under heavy fire this morning in Koch county,  Dickson Gatluak, a spokesman for the government side, said.  Our forces acted in self defense and repulsed the attacking forces and defeated them,  he added in a statement. Rebel spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel said the army attacked first and rebel forces were now pursuing government soldiers towards the town.  The world s youngest country plunged into war in late 2013 after President Salva Kiir sacked his deputy, Riek Machar.  The dispute erupted into fighting that spread across the country, largely along ethnic lines between forces loyal to Kiir, who is Dinka, and Machar, who is Nuer.  The violence, which the United Nations says has amounted to ethnic cleansing, has forced a third of the population to flee.  Earlier this year, pockets of the country plunged briefly into famine. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Friday designated the site of a watershed event in the history of U.S. gay rights, the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, as a national monument, the first to honor the contributions of gay Americans. The Stonewall Inn gay bar in Manhattan\u2019s Greenwich Village was the scene of a police raid that triggered riots and ignited a long struggle to bring lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people into the American mainstream and guarantee their rights. \u201cWelcome to the family,\u201d the National Park Service said in a  tweet welcoming its 412th site. LGBT rights advocacy groups hailed the national recognition, saying it will help highlight the gay communities\u2019 continued struggles, especially in the aftermath of the June 12 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida that killed 49 people. \u201cThis new national monument will be a source of inspiration to a new generation of Americans across the country standing up for equality and uniting to show the world that love conquers hate,\u201d Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said. The move was the latest of several steps Obama has take on  gay rights during his presidency.  In 2010, he signed a law repealing a policy that had banned gays from serving openly in the U.S. military. In 2012, he became the first president to support gay marriage, a stance he has admitted took time to evolve. His administration also supported the legal challenge that led to the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide. \u201cThere is important distance yet to travel, but through political engagement and litigation, as well as individual acts of courage and acceptance, this movement has made tremendous progress toward securing equal rights and equal dignity,\u201d Obama said in a proclamation officially designating the historic site. The events of late June and early July 1969 in New York helped start the modern American gay rights movement. A week of violent clashes on Christopher Street between patrons of the Stonewall Inn and police, who had periodically raided the bar, arresting gays under morals laws of the era, became known as the Stonewall riots. The crackdown was also tied up in a dispute between the Mafia, which owned the bar, and corrupt police officers seeking payoffs for protection. But it unleashed a year of protests, culminating with the first gay pride parade in 1970. This year\u2019s weekend LGBT pride festivities started in New York on Friday with a street fair and were to culminate with Sunday\u2019s parade through Lower Manhattan. Events were scheduled across the country in San Francisco, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City and elsewhere. Obama\u2019s designation protects about 7.7 acres (3.1 hectares) of land, including the Stonewall Inn and nearby Christopher Park. U.S. lawmakers representing New York, in a statement, called the site \u201ca beacon for liberation.\u201d It drew renewed attention in the wake of this month\u2019s massacre in Orlando at another gay venue, a nightclub called Pulse. Mourners in New York flocked to the inn and created a makeshift memorial after the shooting, the worst such attack in modern U.S. history.  In honor of the new monument, the White House will release a video that will be played on billboards in New York\u2019s Times Square on Saturday. U.S. officials will also hold a designation ceremony at Stonewall on Monday. ",

The letter from the Senate panel seeking all documents, emails and telephone records arrived at Trump\u2019s campaign committee last week and was addressed to its treasurer, the Post said. This marked the first time the Trump campaign organization has been drawn into the bipartisan committee\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election, it said. Dozens of former campaign staffers are expected to be contacted soon to ensure they are aware of the request, the Post said, citing the two people. The letter was signed by Republican Senator Richard Burr, the committee\u2019s chairman, and Senator Mark Warner, its top Democrat, according to the Post, which said representatives for Burr and Warner declined to comment. The Senate panel\u2019s investigation is among several in Congress into Russian interference in the election, and is separate from a probe into the matter being led by a special counsel appointed last week by the Justice Department, former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller.

Glassner did not immediately respond to a request for comment and a White House representative had no immediate comment, the Post said. Trump\u2019s administration has been dogged by concerns about its ties to Russia and questions over whether Trump associates may have cooperated with Russians as they sought to meddle in last year\u2019s election on Trump\u2019s behalf. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trump\u2019s favor. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia.

Police said divers were still searching the area and they were investigating reports of other body parts that may have been spotted in Copenhagen harbor. Danish inventor Peter Madsen has been charged with killing Kim Wall, a Swedish journalist, in his home-made submarine.   We re dealing with a torso where arms, legs and head were cut off deliberately. The length of the torso doesn t speak against it being Kim Wall, but we still don t know,  Copenhagen police spokesman Jens Moller said in a video statement. Madsen told a court she had died in an accident on board the submarine and that he had buried her at sea, changing his earlier statement that he dropped her off alive in Copenhagen. Police are conducting DNA tests to identify the torso - found on Monday by a passing cyclist - and the results are due Wednesday morning, Moller said. The bizarre case has dominated Danish and Swedish media, and drawn interest from around the world. Madsen has been charged with the manslaughter of Wall, who has been missing since he took her out to sea in his 17-metre (56 feet) submarine on Aug. 10. He denies the charge. He was rescued a day later after his UC3 Nautilus sank in the narrow strait between Denmark and Sweden. Police found nobody else in the wreck. Madsen, an entrepreneur, artist, submarine builder and aerospace engineer, went before a judge on Saturday for preliminary questioning. The case is closed to the public in order to protect further investigations, police said. ",

        "title": "Trump names temporary chairs for U.S. labor agencies",
        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has appointed Republican members of two federal labor agencies to serve as their acting chairs, an early signal of a shift to more business-friendly policies. The National Labor Relations Board on Thursday said Trump had named Philip Miscimarra to the temporary role, one day after the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced that Victoria Lipnic had been named acting chair of the commission. The NLRB oversees union elections and enforces a federal law protecting workers\u2019 rights to organize. The EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Under former President Barack Obama, both agencies were the target of fierce criticism from business groups and Republican officials.  Miscimarra and Lipnic, both Obama appointees, will temporarily replace Democrats who had chaired the agencies until Trump\u2019s permanent replacements are confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The EEOC and NLRB chairs make staffing decisions and have a key role in updating guidelines and setting agency priorities. The EEOC currently has one vacancy, and the NLRB has two. Despite being Obama appointees, Lipnic and Miscimarra have routinely broken with their Democratic colleagues.  Miscimarra\u2019s many dissents in NLRB cases since his appointment in 2013 helped lay the foundation for claims by the business community that under Obama, the board baldly favored unions rather than promoting a balance between labor and management. In 2012, Lipnic dissented in a landmark EEOC case in which the commission ruled for the first time that discrimination against gay workers is a form of unlawful sex bias. She also objected to guidelines on pregnancy discrimination released by the commission in 2014, and regulations published the following year that made it easier for workers to sue for age discrimination. Lipnic, who worked at the U.S. Department of Labor under President George W. Bush before joining the EEOC in 2010, said in a statement that she was honored by the appointment. \u201cI believe equal employment opportunity is critical to all Americans and to how we define ourselves as a nation,\u201d she said. Miscimarra in a separate statement said his goal was \u201cto foster stability and to apply the National Labor Relations Act in an even-handed manner that serves the interests of employees, employers and unions throughout the country.\u201d ",

        "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Members of Italy s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which leads most opinion polls before a national election early next year, began voting on Thursday to elect their leader and candidate for prime minister. Barring a colossal surprise the winner will be Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old lower house deputy who has been groomed as leader over the last few years by Beppe Grillo, the comedian who founded 5-Star as a protest movement in 2009. The party s supporters are voting online on a dedicated platform linked to Grillo s blog, reflecting 5-Star s credo of internet-based direct democracy.  Voting will end at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT) on Thursday, but the result will not be known until Saturday, when it is announced at 5-Star s annual three-day gathering in the Adriatic coastal town of Rimini. There are eight candidates, but Di Maio s victory is considered a formality. He is one of Italy s most prominent and popular politicians and his seven rivals, mostly local councillors, are virtually unknown even to 5-Star supporters.  The only people seen as having any chance against him decided not to run, opening the party up to accusations of failing to run a proper contest. Roberto Saviano, author of the best-selling novel Gomorra, said on Facebook that he wanted to run for the post  to help 5-Star out of a pathetic situation . Saviano is not a party member and so is not eligible. Probably the only risk for Di Maio would be if voting were distorted by another hacking attack against 5-Star s internet platform. In August an anonymous hacker revealed he had broken into the system to obtain secret data on 5-Star s members and donors.       ",

        "text": "DUBAI (Reuters) - A Saudi cleric who said women should not drive because their brains shrink to a quarter the size of a man s when they go shopping has been banned from preaching, state television said. Saad al-Hijri was suspended from all religious activity after advising against allowing women to drive in a speech that contained comments  diminishing human value , the broadcaster quoted a spokesman for the governor of Asir province as saying. Ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that bans women from driving, despite ambitious government targets to increase their public role, especially in the workforce. Women in the kingdom are also bound by law to wear long robes and a headscarf and require the consent of a male guardian for most legal actions. In a video identifying him as the head of the religious edicts department in the southern province, Hijri asked what the traffic department would do it if it discovered a man with only half a brain.  Would it give him a license or not? It would not. So how can it give it to a woman when she has only half?  he said.  If she goes to the market she loses another half. What is left? A quarter...We demand the traffic department check because she is not suitable to drive and she has only a quarter.  The comments sparked anger on social media, which is hugely popular in the kingdom. Twitter users shared the video, many criticising it and making jokes about his remarks, under the Arabic hashtag  Al-Hijri_women_quarter_brain  Some users posted pictures of Saudi female scientists and academics in response and questioned Hijri s own intellectual capacities. His suspension, ordered by the provincial governor, was aimed at preventing the spread of views that spark controversy and do not serve the national interest, the provincial spokesman said, according to Ekhbariya TV s official Twitter account. Any others who used religious platforms to preach such views would also be banned. The government s modernizing reforms, backed by Saudi Arabia s business class, have sparked tensions with influential clerics upon whose support the ruling family relies. Some clerics have millions of followers on social media. ",

Facing $70 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, Puerto Rico is trying to solve an economic crisis before it hits substantial debt payments in May and July. It has defaulted on some of its debt and is trying to persuade creditors to take concessions.  In September, Puerto Rico officials unveiled the sweeping Puerto Rico Fiscal and Economic Growth Plan (FEGP), which included cuts to teacher pensions, a new financial control board and restructuring $18 billion of debt due in the coming five years. The proposed plan was subject to negotiation with creditors and relied on significant action from Washington as well as passing legislative hurdles in the U.S. territory.  \u201cThe FEGP is being revised given the recent reduction in revenue projections already reported by PR Treasury,\u201d Acosta said, adding that it would be extended from five years to ten. A conference call with creditors is taking place on Friday, she said.  \u201cGiven this, the restructuring proposal is being adjusted accordingly,\u201d she said.

        "text": "COLOMBO (Reuters) - The United Nations on Friday urged the Sri Lankan government to urgently implement reforms to end war-time arbitrary detention and strengthen independent monitoring of tough legislation. Sri Lanka has used the 1979 Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to pursue a tough line to prevent aiding and abetting terrorism in the island nation s long conflict with Tamil Tiger rebels. That legislation gives wide powers to police to arrest a suspect without informing the immediate family, restricts access to lawyers and allows detention of up to 18-months without charging. The war ended in 2009, but the government has not repealed PTA, though it had promised to end arbitrary detentions. Many ethnic minority Tamils who have been arrested under the PTA have complained of years of detention without being charged. The U.N. is now asking Sri Lanka to repeal the draconian law and introduce an internationally acceptable law. The government says it has begun moves to replace the PTA and is in the process of introducing new legislation.   There are no effective safeguards against arbitrariness in this context and there is an urgent need to strengthen mechanisms for independent monitoring and oversight, Leigh Toomey, a member of the UN working group on arbitrary detention told reporters in Colombo after concluding a 11-day mission. She said they had identified significant challenges to the right of personal liberty in Sri Lanka, resulting in arbitrary detention across the country. The Working Group also said their attention had been drawn to a loss of liberty among the socially vulnerable, such as children, women, elderly people, people with psycho-social problems and the poor. Sri Lanka is under criticism from the rights groups over its slow progress on the commitments it made to the UN human Rights council following a U.N. resolution that called for post-war reconciliation and an investigation of all alleged war crimes. Sri Lanka ended a 26-year-civil war crushing the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelan in 2009. The United Nations and rights groups have accused the military of killing thousands of civilians, mostly Tamils, during the final weeks of the conflict. The Tamil Tigers were also accused of widespread abuses during the war, such as using child soldiers and targeting civilians with suicide bombers. In November European lawmakers said they were disappointed about Sri Lanka s slow roll-out of human rights reforms that it had promised in exchange for trade concessions.   A U.N. rights watchdog in 2016 called on Sri Lanka to investigate documented allegations of torture and rape of detainees by security forces and to rein in broad police powers. The U.N. Committee against Torture described continuing reports of abductions, deaths in custody, poor conditions of detention and the use of forced confessions in court. ",

Kaladze, now 39 and running as a candidate for the ruling Georgian Dream party, has an advantage over the other seven candidates in the field as one of ex-Soviet Georgia s most recognizable public figures. He told Reuters after a campaign event he considered his career in sport was good preparation for politics. It taught him about teamwork.  Every time when I talk about success in politics or in sport, I stress how important it is to have a team of professionals,  he said. Kaladze has more than 30 percent support among likely voters, the National Democratic Institute said in a report this month   more than any other candidates. His closest competitor is likely to be Zaal Udumashvili, a well-known former television anchor who is representing the United National Movement, an opposition party. The result may have to be decided in a second round run-off. Some voters see Kaladze as the favorite, in part because he has the backing of Bidzina Ivanishvili, the founder of the Georgian Dream party and Georgia s richest man.  I m sure Kaladze will be elected as a mayor,  said Nugzar Malkhazashvili, a 47-year-old doctor and resident of the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. Kaladze s soccer career included a spell at Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv, then a period at AC Milan during which the club were Italian league champions once and won the UEFA Champions League twice. He finished his career at another Italian club, Genoa, before retiring in 2011. Kaladze was also a successful businessman, owning a handful of investments in Georgia, Ukraine, Italy and Kazakhstan. He entered politics in the year he retired, becoming an active supporter of Ivanishvili. He has served as energy minister and deputy prime minister in governments dominated by Ivanishvili s allies. In the race for mayor of the Georgian capital he has promised to solve problems with traffic by building new roads and overpasses, improve ecology by constructing new parks and green zones and to address education and healthcare problems. He said he was already looking beyond the election, and focusing on how he will fulfill his promises.  I don t see October 21 (the election day) as a problem.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new Republican bill to replace Obamacare will be unveiled in the U.S. Senate on Monday with backing from President Donald Trump, according to one of two Republican senators who have crafted the legislation. The lawmaker, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, told reporters he was optimistic the legislation could pass before a Sept. 30 deadline, if it can attract the bare minimum of 50 votes needed to succeed in the Republican-led Senate with tie-breaking support from Vice President Mike Pence. The bill, which Cassidy is sponsoring with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, could revive Republican hopes of overturning the Affordable Care Act weeks after their last attempt on July 28 came up one vote short in a humiliating defeat for Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. The new measure, which would give more healthcare powers to the states, is a revamped version of legislation that did not gain enough support during the summer healthcare debate.   \u201cMitch has said that if we get 50 votes, he\u2019ll hold a vote. I can tell you that the president\u2019s all about it,\u201d said Cassidy, noting the bill had also drawn some favorable comment from a key July \u2018no\u2019 vote, Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona. Some Senate Republicans doubt there will be a successful last-ditch effort this year to replace former Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law.  \u201cIt is not easy to get 50-plus-one (votes). Everybody\u2019s kind of got another idea. But I\u2019m open to it,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Republican. Cassidy said the legislation has had fulsome support from White House officials including Pence, who he said had sought to rally the support of state governors. Graham and former Republican Senator Rick Santorum have held discussions with the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which played a key role in getting an Obamacare repeal bill through the House of Representatives earlier this year.  If approved in the Senate, the bill would need to be reconciled with the House legislation. Both chambers would then need to vote a second time. Since Democrats oppose repealing Obamacare, Republicans need to use a parliamentary procedure known as reconciliation to move healthcare legislation on a simple majority through the Senate, which they control by a 52-48 margin. The tool that allows reconciliation is contained in a 2017 budget resolution that will expire with the fiscal year on Sept. 30. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. voters picked climate change advocates in a handful of gubernatorial and state legislature races on Tuesday, providing a potential boost to state-level efforts to fight global warming through carbon trading schemes. Democratic-led state and local governments have already promised to act as a counterweight to the administration of President Donald Trump, which is seeking to unwind climate change regulations it deems too costly, and remove the United States from a global pact to reduce emissions.  Democrat Phil Murphy won his race on Tuesday night to succeed New Jersey\u2019s outgoing Republican Governor Chris Christie. Murphy ran on a platform that included a pledge to \u201cimmediately restore New Jersey\u2019s place in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI),\u201d a northeast carbon market from which Christie withdrew in 2011. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespe and pledged to carry out outgoing Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe\u2019s executive directive to reduce carbon emissions and \u201callow Virginia to become trading-ready.\u201d RGGI Chair Katie Dykes said its officials had been communicating with Virginia as it developed greenhouse gas regulations, and welcomed the \u201cpotential dialogue with New Jersey.\u201d In Washington state, a victory by Democrat\u00a0Manka Dhingra in a state Senate district flipped control of the legislature to Democrats, a boost to Democratic Governor Jay Inslee\u2019s plan to join California, Quebec and Ontario in a carbon trading scheme.  RGGI and the western state carbon market were formed more than a decade ago to help develop market-based approaches to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The addition of Virginia and New Jersey to RGGI would be significant. In 2016, New Jersey emitted 22.1 million short tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) while Virginia emitted 38 million. RGGI\u2019s current nine states emitted 90 million short tons in 2016. RGGI holds quarterly auctions for carbon permits, which have yielded $2.8 billion in proceeds to date, intended for use to finance clean energy and energy efficiency projects. Environmental advocates said state-level developments could help counter the Trump administration, as its seeks to revive the U.S. coal industry and roll back environmental protections enacted by Democratic former President Barack Obama. \u201cWe are seeing growing momentum on climate action at the state level,\u201d said Jackson Morris, an official at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

        "text": "(Reuters) - Warren Buffett is closely monitoring whether U.S. President Donald Trump can lower corporate taxes, one of the rare times the billionaire has looked to Washington to help him decide which stocks to buy and sell. \u201cIt\u2019s an actual factor at Berkshire,\u201d Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC television. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very, very, very seldom in my 87 years that it has ever been a factor.\u201d Buffett normally buys stocks for the long term with less focus on tax issues. But when asked if he was thinking about taxes, he said \u201cI think about them plenty\u201d now. \u201cWe\u2019ve got actions on both sides that we would take,\u201d referring to taking gains or realizing losses, he said. Berkshire has said it ended June with more than $135 billion of equity investments, which Buffett mainly controls and holds for the long term. The conglomerate is sitting on huge gains in big investments such as American Express Co (AXP.N), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), while other bets such as International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) have fared less well. Buffett had said at Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 6 that he would rather realize losses than take gains if he expected rates to fall. That might be a good strategy now, if Trump and many congressional Republicans succeeded in lowering the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Buffett explained that he would \u201cfeel kind of silly\u201d realizing a $1 billion gain and paying $350 million in taxes, only to have Congress lower the rate and thus his tax bill. He said other investors sitting on \u201chundreds of billions\u201d of dollars of potential profits might be thinking the same thing. It is unclear whether the Republican-controlled Congress can pass a tax bill that Trump will sign, and Buffett said it has been unable to overhaul the Affordable Care Act or move forward on infrastructure, two of the president\u2019s priorities. He expects to know by year end whether taxes are going down. \u201cI would think the Republicans controlling both houses [of Congress] and the presidency, they would not want to have a shutout, in their first year,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cI think they can get it done.\u201d ",

        "title": "Trump resists pressure to soften stance on Iran nuclear deal",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump finds himself under immense pressure as he considers de-certifying the international nuclear deal with Iran, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility. Trump is expected to unveil a broad strategy on confronting Iran this week, likely on Friday. There was always the chance he could still have a last-minute change of heart and certify Iran s compliance with the 2015 accord, which he has called an  embarrassment  and the  worst deal ever negotiated.  Senior U.S. officials, European allies and prominent U.S. lawmakers have told Trump that refusing to certify the deal would leave the U.S. isolated, concede the diplomatic high ground to Tehran, and ultimately risk the unraveling of the agreement. Signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, the deal relieved sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbing its disputed nuclear program. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) concluded that Iran secretly researched a nuclear warhead until 2009, which Tehran denies. Iran has always insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and denies it has aimed to build an atomic bomb.      After Trump made clear three months ago he would not certify Iran s compliance with the deal, his advisers moved to give him options to consider, a senior administration official said.  They came up with a plan that protects the things they are concerned about but doesn t recertify, which the president made clear he was not going to do. That ship has sailed,  according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said Trump has been telling foreign leaders and U.S. lawmakers that his refusal to certify the Iran deal would not blow it up.  He s not walking away from it. The chances of him walking away from it go down if they work with him on making it better,  the official said. White House officials said Trump is expected to announce a broad, more confrontational policy toward Iran directed at curbing its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and financial and military support for Hezbollah and other extremist groups. Trump has said he believes the nuclear deal is too generous toward Iran and would not stop it from trying to develop a nuclear weapon.  He has criticized the agreement s  sunset clauses,  under which some restrictions on Iran s nuclear program would expire over time. He also wants to toughen language on ballistic missiles and inspections. The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran is complying with the agreement. European officials have categorically ruled out renegotiating the deal, but have said they share Trump s concerns over Iran s destabilizing influence in the Middle East. Several diplomats have said Europe would be ready to discuss sanctioning Iran s ballistic missile tests and forming a strategy to curb Iran s influence in the region. Officials have also said there could be room to open a new negotiation for what happens once some of the core terms of the deal begin expiring in 2025, although there is no reason to believe Iran would be ready to enter in such a negotiation. Iran has said it may exit the deal if the U.S. withdraws. De-certifying would not withdraw the United States from the deal but it would give the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose the sanctions on Tehran that were suspended under the agreement. One U.S. official involved in administration said that declining to certify Iran s compliance would probably leave all of the parties to the deal on one side and the United States on the other.  That means that while the French and others are also interested in curbing Iran s destabilizing activities, they may be less likely to follow (the U.S.) lead at the risk of the agreement blowing up,  the official said. British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron both spoke to Trump this week to express their concerns about the potential decision not to recertify the Iran deal.  If the feeling is that the United States no longer supports the agreement, then the political reality is that the agreement will be in serious jeopardy and its implementation will be very difficult,  a senior French diplomat said. Two other U.S. officials, who also requested anonymity, said Trump s bellicose rhetoric on a number of fronts is troubling both many of his own aides and some of America s closest allies, a few of whom have asked U.S. officials privately if Trump s real objective is attacking Iran s nuclear facilities. One of the officials said that like the heated rhetoric with North Korea on its nuclear program, the Iran discussion has vexed White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  who have tried to advise the President that there are significant risks in the course he d prefer to pursue.   At the end of the day, though, everyone recognizes that he s the decider.  Trump allies who oppose the deal have watched the president closely to see if he might buckle under pressure.    He s not going to re-certify,  said Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump national security aide.  I m not worried. His gut instinct is absolutely right.  ",

        "title": "Tillerson signals tough Trump administration stance on Cuba",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Tuesday a policy of engagement with Cuba has financially benefited the island\u2019s government in violation of U.S. law, further fueling expectations that President Donald Trump this week will roll back parts of former President Barack Obama\u2019s opening to Havana. Speaking ahead of Trump\u2019s expected trip to Miami on Friday to announce his new Cuba policy, Tillerson insisted that Havana \u201cmust begin to address human rights challenges\u201d if it wants Washington to continue normalizing relations between the Cold War-era foes. Tillerson, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, acknowledged that rapprochement with the communist-ruled island has led to an increase in U.S. visitors and U.S. business ties. However, Tillerson added: \u201cWe think we have achieved very little in terms of changing the behavior of the regime in Cuba .... and it has little incentive today to change that.\u201d His comments came as Trump\u2019s aides sought to finalize rules that, according to U.S. officials and people familiar with the discussions, are likely to bar U.S. trade with Cuban enterprises linked to the military \u2013 which controls a large part of the economy \u2013 and tighten some rules on Americans traveling there.  But the new policy will stop short of closing embassies or breaking off relations re-established in 2015 after more than five decades of hostility, the sources said. In his speech, Trump is expected to claim fulfillment of a campaign promise to the Cuban-American community to tighten the screws on the government of Cuban President Raul Castro. While Tillerson declined to confirm any details, he left no doubt that the Trump administration was prepared to undo some pieces of Obama\u2019s policy that it sees as boosting the Cuban government financially, which would violate U.S. law. \u201cAs we\u2019re developing these business relationships and as we\u2019re enjoying the benefits on the economic and development side, are we inadvertently or directly providing financial support to the regime? Our view is we are,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cAnd the question is ... how how do we bring that back into compliance with longstanding statutory obligations\u201d he said. Many of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, and some Democrats, objected to Obama\u2019s policy shift, saying he gave too much for too few concessions from Cuba. But Obama\u2019s measures have proven popular with the public, U.S. businesses and many lawmakers from both parties. Tillerson agreed that moves toward more normal relations with the United States have helped some Cubans lift themselves out of poverty and provided opportunities for U.S. companies. However, Tillerson said there is a \u201cdark side\u201d to relations with Cuba, noting that the government in Havana continues to jail political opponents and harass dissidents. \u201cWe are supportive of the continued economic development, as long as it is done in full compliance with our existing statutes to not provide financial support to the regime,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cThat\u2019s the focus of our current policy review.\u201d But divisions remain within the Trump administration over how far to go. Some aides have argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. business and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a promise to Cuban-Americans whose support they considered significant in winning Florida in the 2016 election. Miami is home to the largest Cuban-American community. One proposal under consideration, according to the U.S. sources, would tighten enforcement to make sure Americans legally fit the authorized categories they claim to be traveling under. Another tougher change being weighed would revert to regulations requiring at least some types of U.S. travelers to seek a special license to travel to Cuba. However, airline officials say they do not expect the Trump administration to revoke any flights to Cuba approved by the Obama administration but said new measures to restrict visits to Cuba could result in less demand for seats.

        "title": "Obama makes last attempt to persuade Congress to close Guantanamo",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama launched a final push on Tuesday to persuade Congress to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, despite strong opposition from lawmakers who do not want detainees transferred to the United States. The president, a Democrat, pressed the Republican-led legislature to give his proposal a \u201cfair hearing\u201d and said he did not want to pass the issue to his successor in January. The Pentagon-authored plan proposes 13 potential sites on U.S. soil to hold some 30-60 detainees in maximum-security prisons but does not identify the facilities. U.S. law bars transfers to the United States, and lawmakers are unlikely to lift those restrictions, especially in an election year. \u201cWe\u2019ll review President Obama\u2019s plan,\u201d Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said. \u201cBut since it includes bringing dangerous terrorists to facilities in U.S. communities, he should know that the bipartisan will of Congress has already been expressed against that proposal.\u201d Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said Obama had yet to convince Americans that moving the prisoners to the United States was smart or safe. Obama is considering taking executive action to close the facility, situated in a U.S. naval station in southeast Cuba, if Congress does not change its position. The White House declined to rule out a unilateral option on Tuesday. Republicans oppose any executive order, and issuing one would almost certainly generate legal challenges. The Guantanamo prisoners were rounded up overseas when the United States became embroiled in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The facility came to symbolize aggressive detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture. Most detainees have been held without trial for more than a decade. \u201cLet us go ahead and close this chapter,\u201d Obama said at the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pass this problem on to the next president, whoever it is. And if, as a nation, we don\u2019t deal with this now, when will we deal with it?\u201d Obama pledged as a presidential candidate in 2008 to close Guantanamo. Doing so would fulfill that pledge and boost his legacy during his final year in office. Pressing his case now thrust the issue into the 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cNot only are we not going to close Guantanamo - when I am president, if we capture a terrorist alive, they are ... going to Guantanamo and we are going to find out everything they know,\u201d said Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio. The plan would send detainees who have been cleared for transfer to their homelands or third countries and transfer remaining prisoners to U.S. soil to be held in maximum-security prisons. Congress has banned such transfers to the United States since 2011.      Though the Pentagon has previously noted some of the sites it surveyed for use as potential U.S. facilities, the administration wants to avoid fueling any political outcry in important swing states before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Republican Senator John McCain, Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential opponent and an advocate of closing the prison, scoffed at the plan as not being focused. \u201cThirteen different possible sites. That\u2019s a recommendation?\u201d he said. The White House has sought to buttress its argument for closing the prison by focusing on its high cost. Obama said nearly $450 million was spent last year alone to keep it running. The new plan would be cheaper, officials said. The transfer and closure costs would be $290 million to $475 million, an administration official told reporters, while housing remaining detainees in the United States would be $65 million to $85 million less expensive than at the Cuba facility, meaning the transfer bill would be offset in 3 to 5 years. The administration hopes sending the plan to Congress will spur lawmakers to help choose a facility they find amenable, but the White House is well aware the plan may not move at all. \u201cI am very clear-eyed about the hurdles to finally closing Guantanamo. The politics of this are tough,\u201d Obama said. \u201cPart of my message to the American people here is we\u2019re already holding a bunch of really dangerous terrorists here in the United States ... and there have been no incidents.  We\u2019ve managed it just fine.\u201d The Guantanamo facility, which Obama said once held nearly 800 people, now houses 91 detainees. Some 35 prisoners will be transferred to other countries in the coming months, bringing the final number below 60, officials said. More prisoners could be transferred other countries as well, potentially lowering that number further. Obama said military commissions would continue to be used to try some of the prisoners, but he said that process also required reform. Obama noted that his predecessor, Republican President George W. Bush, transferred hundreds of prisoners out of Guantanamo and wanted it closed.  ",

        "text": "COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Twelve-year-old Nur Hafes would rather be in school or playing football with friends at home in Myanmar. Instead, he waits by the road in Palong Khali refugee camp in southern Bangladesh, looking for visitors who might give him money for his family.  Sole breadwinner for seven younger siblings and his mother since they arrived at the camp in Cox s Bazar two months ago, Nur spends his days watching for Muslim clerics who distribute money collected at mosques for the refugees.  Opening a brown umbrella, Nur offers to shade the visitors from the blazing sun, which can bring in a little extra cash for food and supplies. (Click reut.rs/2AtT2uy for photo essay on Nur Hafes and his family.)    Sometimes I get 50 or 100 taka and some days I come back empty-handed,  Nur said, holding up a 50-taka ($0.60) note he received from a donor.  Nur and his family are among the more than 600,000 Rohingyas who have fled to Bangladesh since August to escape a counter-insurgency operation by the Myanmar military after attacks on security posts by Rohingya militants.  United Nations officials have described the military s actions in Myanmar s northern Rakhine state as  ethnic cleansing , an accusation the Southeast Asian nation denies.  The family left their home in Tharay Kone Yoe Dan village in Rakhine s Maungdaw township when the violence started.   The Myanmar army burnt the houses with the people inside,  said Nur s mother, Rabia Khatun.   I saw many people with gunshot wounds and heard the crackle of houses burning.   She gathered a few belongings - a blanket to protect her children from rain, identity papers and a couple of old photos - and the family fled to her parents  village, Zaw Mat Tat, south of Maungdaw.   The next day, the army showed up there, too. Her husband became upset and suddenly left. Rabia has not seen him since.  Left with eight children, six of them younger than 10, she kept going. That evening, the family took a three-hour boat journey to Shah Porir Dwip, on the Bangladesh side of the Naf River.  Now the family relies on Nur for support. He was a huge help in Myanmar, reselling produce in their village market that his father had bought wholesale.  Nur and his mother said they hope he can eventually do something similar in Bangladesh, although Nur also still talks about school and football. With Nur s family huddled under a tarpaulin tent and his mother needing help to feed his siblings, the youngest two of whom suffer malnourishment, a normal child s life is not in his immediate future.  I know he is young, but he understands his responsibilities. He doesn t behave like a child anymore,  Nur s mother said.  ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - The 2016 election cycle had been a ratings boon for U.S. cable news networks, and Tuesday\u2019s stunning U.S. presidential election victory by Republican Donald Trump was no different. Time Warner Inc\u2019s CNN led all U.S. TV networks in primetime coverage with 13.3 million viewers, the most-watched Election Night coverage in U.S. cable news history, according to Nielsen data. 21st Century Fox\u2019s Fox News came in second with 12.1 million viewers, and Comcast Corp\u2019s MSNBC was far behind with just under 6 million.

        "title": "Migrant smuggling crackdown triggered clashes in Libyan city: armed group head",
        "text": "TRIPOLI (Reuters) - An armed group in the Libyan smuggling hub of Sabratha is being targeted because it began stopping migrant boats leaving for Italy, leading to heavy clashes with groups benefiting from the trade, the head of the group said.  The fighting over the past two weeks has caused dozens of casualties, displaced hundreds of families, and put Sabratha s famed Roman ruins at risk.  Migrant crossings from Libya have dropped sharply since July, a change that the armed group, the Anas al-Dabbashi brigade, says is due to its policing of the coast near Sabratha under a deal with the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli. Brigade leader Ahmed al-Dabbashi, also known as Al-Ammu (the uncle) and described in a U.N. report as one of Libya s top smuggling facilitators, said the move had led to attacks by rivals smuggling from al-Wadi, an area just east of Sabratha.  We, al-Dabbashi brigade, had an agreement with Government of National Accord (GNA) to stop illegal migration,  Dabbashi told Reuters by phone in an interview, referring to the Tripoli administration.  Then we were surprised that after stopping migration the Shuhada al-Wadi brigade started coming at us with their four-by-four vehicles painted in military police colors and their members started wearing military uniforms.  They started harassing us because we stopped migration and this is bad for them,  Dabbashi said. A senior Dabbashi member said last week that the brigade s sudden shift from smuggling to policing was motivated by a desire for legitimacy in the form of police and army jobs for its members. It and the Italian government have denied reports that Dabbashi was paid by Italy to stop the migrant boats. Dabbashi said the Wadi brigade is aligned with the Operations Room, a force formed to oust Islamic State jihadists from Sabratha last year and that clashes began when Dabbashi s cousin Abubaker was killed at an Operations Room checkpoint.  Saleh Graisia, an Operations Room spokesman, said clashes erupted because the actions of the Dabbashi brigade and the allied Brigade 48 were  out of control . The Operations Room and its allies, which include ultra-conservative Salafists and locals from Al-Wadi, had moved to push  militias  from Sabratha, he said.   The Room has its own conditions. The top one is that all militias withdraw from the city and hand over their weapons so the city be under legitimacy of the police and army.  Fighting has led to the evacuation of hundreds of families from central Sabratha, said Essam Krir, head of an association of non-governmental organizations. Several civilians and at least 13 fighters have been killed, while dozens of combatants have been wounded, according to Dabbashi and Graisia.  Fighting has raged around Sabratha s hospital and its Roman ruins, a UNESCO World Heritage site. UNESCO s head appealed for all parties to  ensure the safeguarding of Sabratha s unique cultural heritage .  We have orders to not use heavy artillery for the protection of the ruins,  Graisia said. The Operations Room said on its Facebook page it had taken control of the ruins. The head of Sabratha s antiquities department, Mohamed Bojela Rhoma, said because of the clashes, it had not been possible to check a report of the amphitheatre being hit. Pictures posted on social media appear to show surface damage to the monument and empty bullet cases scattered in the ruins.   ",

        "text": " (This October 18 story has been refiled to fix dateline, amend headline and first paragraph) ANGOOR ADDA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan is betting that a pair of nine-foot chain-link fences topped with barbed wire will stop incursions by Islamist militants from Afghanistan, which opposes Islamabad s plans for a barrier along the disputed frontier. Pakistan plans to fence up most of the 2,500 km (1,500 mile) frontier despite Kabul s protests that the barrier would divide families and friends along the Pashtun tribal belt straddling the colonial-era Durand Line drawn up by the British in 1893. Pakistan s military estimates that it will need about 56 billion rupees ($532 million) for the project, while there are also plans to build 750 border forts and employ high-tech surveillance systems to prevent militants crossing. In the rolling hills of the Angoor Adda village in South Waziristan, part of Pakistan s restive Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), three rolls of barbed wire are sandwiched in the six-foot gap between the chain-link fences.  (The fence) is a paradigm change. It is an epoch shift in the border control management,  said a Pakistani army officer in command of South Waziristan during a presentation to foreign media on Wednesday.  There will not be an inch of international border (in South Waziristan) which shall not remain under our observation.  Pakistan s military has so far fenced off about 43 km of the frontier, starting with the most violence-prone areas in FATA, and is expected to recruit tens of thousands of new troops to man the border. It is not clear how long it will take to fence the entire boundary.  But Pakistan s plans have also drawn criticism from across the border. Gulab Mangal, governor of the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar, told Reuters the wall will create  more hatred and resentment  between two neighbors and will do neither country any good.  The fence will definitely create a lot of trouble for the people along the border on both sides but no wall or fence can separate these tribes,  he said.  I urge the tribes to stand against this action.  Pakistan has blamed Pakistani Taliban militants it says are based on Afghan soil for a spate of attacks at home over the past year, urging Kabul to eradicate  sanctuaries  for militants. Afghanistan, in turn, accuses Islamabad of sheltering the leadership of the Afghan Taliban militants who are battling the Western-backed government in Kabul. Both countries deny aiding militants, but relations between the two have soured in recent years. In May, the tension rose when 10 people were killed in two border villages in Baluchistan region. The clashes occurred in so-called  divided villages , where the Durand Line goes through the heart of the community, and where residents are now bracing for the fence to split their villages in two. Pakistan s previous attempts to build a fence failed about a decade ago and many doubt whether its possible to secure such a lengthy border. But Pakistani army officials are undeterred by the scepticism and insist they will finish the job as the country s security rests on this fence.  By the time we are done, inshallah, we will be very sure of one thing: that nobody can cross this place,  said the Pakistani officer in charge of South Waziristan. ",

        "title": "Former Kentucky state lawmaker sentenced to seven years for bribery",
        "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - A former Kentucky lawmaker received a seven-year prison sentence on Thursday for bribing an inspector to overlook violations at his coal mining companies, his attorney said. Former state Representative W. Keith Hall, 56, who was convicted in federal court in June 2015 of paying $46,000 over a five-year period to former mining inspector Kelly Shortridge, was also fined $25,000, said his attorney, Brent Caldwell.  Prosecutors said at Hall\u2019s trial in Lexington that most of the funds were funneled from Hall\u2019s companies to a shell company the two men created in the name of Shortridge\u2019s wife. Shortridge reached a plea agreement and testified against Hall. He is slated to start his 24-month sentence next week. According to court documents, sentencing guidelines for Hall called for more than eight years in prison. His attorneys argued a sentence closer to the minimum 6-1/2 years was more appropriate. Caldwell said on Thursday an appeal was still possible, adding his client disagreed with the verdict. Hall, a Democrat, served 14 years in the Kentucky General Assembly before losing a primary election in May 2014. His indictment came five months later. His companies listed in the indictment included Beech Creek Coal Co, LLC & HEI Services LLC. ",

        "title": "U.S. top court appears unlikely to revive Obama immigration plan",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama\u2019s bid to save his plan to spare millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits ran into trouble on Monday at the U.S. Supreme Court in a case testing the limits of presidential power. The court, with four conservative justices and four liberals, seemed divided along ideological lines during 90 minutes of arguments in the case brought by 26 states led by Texas that sued to block Obama\u2019s unilateral 2014 executive action that bypassed Congress. Liberal justices voiced support for Obama\u2019s action. The  conservatives sounded skeptical. A 4-4 decision would be a grim defeat for Obama because it would uphold lower court rulings that threw out his action last year and doom his quest to revamp a U.S. immigration policy he calls broken. More than a thousand people in favor of Obama\u2019s action staged a raucous demonstration outside the white marble courthouse on a sunny spring day, with cheery mariachi music from a red-and-black clad band filling the air. A smaller group of Obama critics staged their own rally. In order to win, Obama would need the support of one of the court\u2019s conservatives, most likely Chief Justice John Roberts or Anthony Kennedy. But they both at times hit the Obama administration\u2019s lawyer, U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, with tough questions. Kennedy expressed concern that Obama had exceeded its authority by having the executive branch set immigration policy rather than carry out laws passed by Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the president is setting the policy and the Congress is executing it. That\u2019s just upside down,\u201d Kennedy said. A ruling is due by the end of June. Obama\u2019s plan was tailored to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. Obama said the program, called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), was aimed at preventing families from being torn apart. The case comes during a heated presidential campaign in which the status of the roughly 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally, most of them from Mexico and other Latin American nations, has been a central theme. Immigration is also a global concern, with Europe now struggling with a flood of immigrants fleeing violence in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. The Republican-governed states that filed suit asserted that the Democratic president overstepped his authority provided in the Constitution while his administration said he merely provided guidance on how to enforce deportation laws. A 4-4 ruling is possible because there are only eight justices following February\u2019s death of conservative Antonin Scalia. One possible compromise outcome would be that the court could uphold Obama\u2019s plan in part while leaving some legal questions unresolved, including whether the government can provide work permits to eligible applicants. Obama would also win if the justices decide the states had no legitimate grounds to sue. Texas said it had \u201cstanding\u201d to sue because it would be hurt by the additional costs it would incur by providing driver\u2019s licenses to those given legal status. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted the \u201cbasic problem\u201d that the government lacks the resources to deport everyone in the country illegally, meaning it must set priorities. \u201cThere are these people who are here to stay, no matter what,\u201d Ginsburg said.  Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized Texas\u2019 argument about the economic harm caused by Obama\u2019s action, saying millions of immigrants \u201care here in the shadows\u201d and will affect the economy \u201cwhether we want (them) to or not.\u201d Verrilli said the federal government has regularly launched programs aimed at giving large groups of immigrants temporary legal status as part of its role establishing enforcement priorities due to limited resources. Asked by Roberts if the government has the power to allow all immigrants who are in the country illegally to stay, Verrilli said: \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d Shortly before the plan was to take effect, a federal judge in Texas blocked it after the states filed suit. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision in November. Obama\u2019s executive action arose from frustration within the White House and the immigrant community about a lack of action in politically polarized Washington to address the status of people living in the United States illegally. He took the action after House of Representatives Republicans killed bipartisan legislation, called the biggest overhaul of U.S. immigration laws in decades and providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, that was passed by the Senate in 2013. Obama, stifled by Republican lawmakers on many of his major legislative initiatives, has drawn Republican ire with his use of executive action to get around Congress on immigration policy and other matters including gun control and healthcare.

        "title": "Trump, Obama dominate Twitter year, but chicken nuggets prevail",
        "text": "(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump continued to dominate Twitter in 2017 even though former President Barack Obama\u2019s tweets were more liked and both were blown away by one man\u2019s quest for free chicken nuggets. Twitter revealed the year\u2019s most liked and retweeted tweets on Tuesday, reflecting how a nation bitterly divided between Republicans and Democrats is likewise split on social media. Trump, whose 44 million followers of @realDonaldTrump rank him 21st on Twitter, was the most tweeted about world leader and U.S. elected official.  Likewise @FoxNews, the conservative cable news channel, was the top tweeted news outlet, led by @SeanHannity, the host who is a friend and ally of the president. Obama was also well-represented. The former president, whose @BarackObama ranked as the third-most-followed Twitter account behind @katyperry and @justinbieber, posted the most popular tweet: nearly 4.6 million likes for the Nelson Mandela quote, \u201cNo one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion,\u201d with a picture of Obama greeting a diverse group of babies through a window. That was also the second most retweeted item at 1.7 million times. No president could compete with free nuggets, however. A 16-year-old named Carter Wilkerson, @carterjwm, garnered 3.6 million retweets in his campaign for a year\u2019s supply of nuggets from Wendy\u2019s. He came up short of Wendy\u2019s target of 18 million retweets, but Wendy\u2019s still gave him the nuggets and a $100,000 donation in his name to the Wendy\u2019s-linked Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption. The top four new U.S. political accounts were some of Trump\u2019s most forceful critics, led by @PreetBharara, the former federal prosecutor he fired. Next came @SallyQYates, the former acting attorney general who was also fired by Trump. Third was former Obama adviser Ben Rhodes, @brhodes, followed by Obama\u2019s former official photographer, @PeteSouza, who has tweeted flattering pictures of Obama during some of Trump most criticized moments. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, @SHSanders45, rounded out the top five. Other results underscored the punch and counterpunch of politics. Right behind @FoxNews on the top tweeted news outlet list was @CNN, which Trump derides as fake news. The most tweeted activist hashtag was #Resist, as in resist Trump, followed by #MAGA for Trump\u2019s slogan Make America Great Again. Among national leaders, Trump was followed by @narendramodi of India, @NicolasMaduro of Venezuela and @RT_Erdogan of Turkey. (This story corrects paragraphs 8 and 9 to show request was for one year of free nuggets instead of lifetime supply)  ",

        "title": "Trump would spend billions more on military, but for what? experts ask",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s U.S. military buildup plan would cost hundreds of billions of dollars - but with no apparent strategy, defense experts from across the political spectrum said on Thursday. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any kind of strategy,\u201d said William Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. \u201cHe (Trump) says nobody is going to challenge us because we will be so strong. But that\u2019s not a strategy. It\u2019s just a kind of wish-fulfillment.\u201d U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, a top Trump backer who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the proposal was based on recommendations from groups such as the National Defense Panel and served as a statement of Trump\u2019s commitment to build the military. \u201cI believe this lays out a framework for rebuilding the military, and it represents a commitment by Donald Trump to make this a priority,\u201d Sessions said in an interview. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have presidential leadership really defending the need for a robust national defense, you\u2019re not going to maintain the defense budget.\u201d Trump\u2019s proposal, unveiled in a speech on Wednesday, did not spell out how he would accommodate the additional manpower and hardware as the United States shutters military bases, or where and for what purposes the larger forces would be employed. There were no cost estimates and Trump proposed revenue-raising steps that budget experts called insufficient. \u201cHe just called for higher defense spending without giving us a number and without telling us how he is going to pay for it,\u201d said Lawrence Korb, a former Reagan administration Pentagon official and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank aligned with the Obama administration. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent in the Nov. 8 election, Hillary Clinton, advocates tough defense and foreign policies, but has yet to take a stand on the size of the Pentagon budget. Stephen Miller, a Trump policy adviser, said Trump\u2019s proposal came in contrast to Clinton, who he said has \u201cno military plan.\u201d Trump pledged to expand the Army to 540,000 active-duty troops from its current 480,000, increase the Marine Corps from 23 to 36 battalions \u2013 or as many as 10,000 more Marines \u2013 boost the Navy from 276 to 350 ships and submarines, and raise Air Force tactical aircraft from 1,100 to 1,200. Trump said those numbers were based on assessments by the conservative Heritage Foundation and other groups. Heritage said in a report that it looked at the capacity needed to handle two major wars to determine its force-size recommendations. Trump said he would bolster the development of missile defenses and cyber capabilities. He made no mention of U.S. nuclear forces already in the midst of a modernization effort that will cost an estimated $1 trillion over 30 years. To pay for the buildup, Trump said he would ask Congress to lift a Pentagon budget cap and \u201cfully offset\u201d the increased costs by collecting unpaid taxes, cutting appropriations for federal programs operating without congressional reauthorization, cracking down on social welfare fraud and other fraud, and collecting additional taxes and fees from increased energy production. \u2018SOFT-PEDALING\u2019 THE COST Writing in The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, Tom Donnelly, a defense scholar at the American Enterprise Institute think tank who opposes Trump\u2019s election, praised Trump for embracing a buildup that many mainstream Republicans advocate. \u201cHowever, Trump undercut the power of his proposals by soft-pedaling the cost of such a buildup,\u201d he wrote. Independent cost estimates for Trump\u2019s plan range from $150 billion in additional spending over 10 years, according to the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, to as much as $900 billion over the same period, as assessed by Todd Harrison, a defense budget analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. Harrison said that increase could be achieved only by raising the federal budget deficit, raising taxes, or cutting other spending, such as benefits programs for seniors and the poor. \u201cNone of those things are politically popular,\u201d he said. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that lifting the cap would cost $450 billion over 10 years. The revenue-generating steps proposed by Trump would leave $150 billion of that amount uncovered, it said. Another flaw in Trump\u2019s plan is the assumption that Republican members of the House of Representatives who belong to the deficit-fighting tea party movement would agree to end the budget cap. In April, Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley told a Senate committee that adding more soldiers without a sufficient budget would be disastrous for the country and the Army. Bases would close and programs that support troops and their families would have to be curtailed to make up the shortfall, he said. The Navy already has launched a shipbuilding program to raise the number of vessels to more than 300 by 2021. Trump\u2019s plan fails to account for the country\u2019s limited shipbuilding capacity and the cost of manning, maintaining and basing the additional warships he proposes to build. \u201cThe whole thing is unrealistic,\u201d said Dov Zakheim, the Pentagon\u2019s top financial official under former President George W. Bush. Zakheim, who opposes a Trump presidency, estimates that Trump\u2019s plan would boost defense spending by roughly $300 billion over five years. \u201cIt\u2019s a soundbite,\u201d he said. ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A technician hired by Hillary Clinton to run the private email system she used while U.S. secretary of state told investigators he tried to pass on colleagues\u2019 concerns that the system might not comply with records laws, FBI interview summaries show.  Bryan Pagliano, the technician Clinton hired when she joined the State Department in 2009, told federal investigators he relayed the concerns to Cheryl Mills, then Clinton\u2019s chief of staff. Mills, whose lawyer did not respond to requests for comment, has previously testified under oath she could not recall anyone alerting her to potential problems with Clinton\u2019s email arrangement. The episode had not been disclosed until the Federal Bureau of Investigation released on Friday night nearly 200 pages of additional records from its year-long investigation into the handling of classified government documents by Clinton and her staff via an unauthorized email server in the basement of her New York home. Clinton has said the decision to use a private email system was a mistake, but the controversy has dogged her campaign as the Democratic candidate for the presidency and raised public doubts about her trustworthiness, public opinion polls show. Republicans have criticized her for putting national security at risk. The FBI closed the year-long investigation in July, recommending no charges, although FBI Director James Comey said Clinton and her staff had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in handling classified government secrets. Pagliano has declined to answer questions by Republican lawmakers about his work on Clinton\u2019s server, but spoke to federal investigators after securing a form of immunity from prosecution. He told investigators two colleagues from the technology office approached him with concerns during Clinton\u2019s first year after learning about the email system. One said it could lead to a \u201cfederal records retention issue,\u201d Pagliano told investigators, and urged him to raise the concern with Clinton\u2019s \u201cinner circle.\u201d A colleague also warned Pagliano \u201che wouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if classified information was being sent through Clinton\u2019s unsecure system, Pagliano told the FBI. The newly released interview summaries from the FBI investigation show government employees undercutting other aspects of the public accounts given by Clinton and senior State officials. A State Department employee, whose name was redacted, told investigators they believed senior department officials interfered with the screening of Clinton\u2019s emails for public release last year in a way that helped Clinton.  The employee, who worked on the screening process, said there was pressure to obscure the fact they were finding classified information in the messages. John Kirby, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement the department \u201cstrongly disputes\u201d the claim of interference. Clinton repeatedly said last year she never sent or received classified information, but now says she did not do so knowingly since the release of the FBI findings. The employee also said the Defense Department told the State Department last year it had found about 1,000 emails between Clinton and David Petraeus in its records from his time as the director of the United States Central Command. The State Department has said that Clinton did not include any of her emails with Petraeus when her lawyers screened and returned what they said were all her work emails in 2014. A single conversation of about 10 emails later emerged last year after the Defense Department provided it. Spokesmen for Clinton have declined to discuss the omission, and did not respond to questions about the new interview summaries. Kirby, the department spokesman, said he could not \u201cspeculate\u201d whether the Defense Department had found more than just a single conversation between Clinton and Petraeus. \u201cWe can only speak to the records in our possession,\u201d he said.

        "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States has circulated a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would extend by two years the mandate of an international inquiry into chemical weapons attacks in Syria, after Russia vetoed an extension last week. The U.S. draft, which was seen by Reuters on Thursday, says Syria must not develop or produce chemical weapons, and it calls on all parties in Syria to provide full cooperation with the international probe. The investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) - was unanimously created by the 15-member Security Council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November. The JIM found that the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad was to blame for a chemical attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people in April, according to a report sent to the Security Council on Oct. 26. Two days earlier, Russia vetoed a renewal of the JIM mandate after it was unsuccessful in getting the Security Council to postpone the vote. U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Russia wanted to discuss the Khan Sheikhoun report before the vote. Russia, whose air force and special forces have been supporting the Syrian army, says there is no evidence to show Damascus was responsible for the attack. It maintains that the chemicals that killed civilians belonged to rebels, not Assad s government. [nL8N1N86I0] On Wednesday, the United States admonished Russia for its veto. [nL2N1N805Y]  Russia s attempts to undermine and eliminate the JIM show a callous disregard for the suffering and loss of life caused by the use of chemical weapons and an utter lack of respect for international norms,  the White House said in a statement.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by phone on Thursday it was unacceptable to politicize the work of chemical weapons inspectors in Syria, Russia s foreign ministry said. [nL8N1MP0GI] A Russian draft resolution calls for a six-month extension of the inquiry, with the possibility of further extensions, and asks for investigators to collect environmental samples in connection with the Khan Sheikhoun probe, among other things. In their 14th report since 2011, U.N. investigators said in September they had documented 33 chemical weapons attacks to date.

        "text": "CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian court sentenced top Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie to another life term in prison on Thursday in the latest example of a crackdown against Islamists since the army overthrew President Mohamed Mursi.       The sentence relates to violence that broke out in 2013 after the army toppled Mursi in the wake of mass demonstrations against him. General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led the military at that time and was elected president the following year. Authorities outlawed the Brotherhood after Mursi was ousted and arrested thousands of its supporters. They also dissolved its Freedom and Justice Party, which Mursi led. Mass life and death sentences have been common since then in what rights groups call an unprecedented crackdown.  Fifteen others were sentenced to life in prison in the same case on Thursday while 77 were given 15-year sentences with hard labor. Only 38 of those sentenced on Thursday were present at court while the rest were sentenced in absentia.  The judgment can be appealed in a higher court within the next 60 days.  Those sentenced were charged with inciting terrorism, leading an outlawed group, raiding and vandalizing government facilities among other crimes related to clashes in Beni Suef, south of Egypt in August 2013. The clashes took place the same day security forces dispersed two Islamist sit-ins in central Cairo and killed hundreds of Mursi s supporters.     Those sentenced on Thursday included former members of parliament and members of the Freedom and Justice Party.  Badie was sentenced to life in jail in 2014 after being convicted of murder and inciting violence during clashes that took place during the same period. ",

        "text": " WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Supreme Court nomination battle that was ignited on Saturday with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia has given Democrats an explosive new issue that could bolster their chances of regaining majority control of the U.S. Senate.  The impact could be felt most acutely in \u201cswing\u201d states, where Republicans are trying to hold onto Senate seats, political strategists and analysts said. The high stakes are also expected to prompt greater voter turnout that could favor Democrats.ALSO ON\u00a0REUTERS Trump is a ------: White House hopeful plays fill-in-the-blanks with voters Not in my backyard? Mainstream Scandinavia warily eyes record immigration With no clear idea of who President Barack Obama will nominate as Scalia\u2019s replacement, it was way too early to know exactly how this fight will play out in already rollicking presidential and congressional elections.  But, \u201cin this hyper-polarized political environment we are currently operating in, I can only assume the battle over this (court) nominee will dominate the political debate from here on out,\u201d said Jim Manley, a strategist and former top aide to Democratic senators.  Manley noted Republicans are facing tough races for Senate seats in swing states such as Ohio, Florida, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and could find themselves in even tighter spots because of the divisive fight over Scalia\u2019s replacement.  These Republican candidates, who either already serve in the Senate or are vying for open seats, have to especially thread the needle in their politically divided states on social issues, like abortion rights, that so dominate Supreme Court confirmation fights.  Democrats already enjoyed an advantage in the November Senate elections, having to defend only 10 seats while 24 Republican seats are up for grabs in the 100-member chamber.  Democrats need a net gain of five seats to win back the majority they lost in the 2014 elections.  Just hours after Scalia\u2019s death at the age of 79, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proclaimed that whoever moves into the White House on Jan. 20, 2017 - and not Obama - should pick the replacement for the late conservative jurist.  The Senate must confirm presidential nominees to the life-time appointments at the nine-justice high court, whose recent decisions have had a deep impact on the country, from the legalization of same-sex marriage to election campaign finance.  \u201cIf the Republican leadership refuses to even hold a hearing, I think that is going to guarantee they lose control of the Senate, because I don\u2019t think the American people will stand for that,\u201d proclaimed Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, who was interviewed on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday.\u00a0\u00a0  Meanwhile, McConnell\u2019s announcement sparked new fundraising pleas in the presidential and congressional campaigns, which already were awash in campaign contributions.  Ron Bonjean, a former top Republican Senate leadership aide and current political strategist, acknowledged that Republican Senate candidates from swing states \u201cmay be placed in an awkward position\u201d by the Supreme Court fight.  While some may be pressured to join Democrats in calling for a confirmation vote depending on who Obama nominates, Bonjean also saw a potential upside for those Republicans.  With anti-establishment candidates like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders far exceeding expectations in their quest for the presidency, Republican Senate candidates in swing states could feel emboldened to break from party ranks.  Senator Mark Kirk in Illinois, for example, is one of those Republicans in a swing state facing a potentially rough race.  The 2016 campaigns already were generating an avalanche of voter interest with control of the White House and Congress hanging in the balance.  Now, with the ideological control of the Supreme Court also to be decided, \u201cThat leads to only one conclusion: Increased turnout\u201d of voters in November, said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist.  Higher turnout often helps Democratic presidential candidates, which in turn could help Democratic Senate candidates.  However, Sabato also noted that with the Supreme Court vacancy ascending in importance, it could rally establishment Republicans who currently oppose the anti-establishment Trump to support him if he becomes the party\u2019s nominee.  And that, in turn, could boost Republican turnout in tight Senate races.  ",

        "text": "SAVONLINNA, Finland (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia would be forced to retaliate if Washington pressed ahead with what he called illegal new sanctions against Moscow, describing U.S. conduct towards his country as boorish and unreasonable. Putin, speaking on a visit to Finland, was commenting on a vote by the U.S. House of Representatives which on Tuesday decided to impose new sanctions on Moscow and to force President Donald Trump to obtain lawmakers\u2019 permission before easing any sanctions on Russia.  The sanctions have yet to be approved by the Senate or Trump, and a top White House aide said on Thursday that Trump could veto the legislation in order to push for a tougher deal. Putin, who has repeatedly denied U.S. allegations that Russia interfered with last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election, said Moscow would only decide on how to retaliate against Washington once it had seen the final text of the proposed law. \u201cAs you know, we are exercising restraint and patience, but at some moment we\u2019ll have to retaliate. It\u2019s impossible to endlessly tolerate this boorishness towards our country,\u201d Putin told a joint news conference with his Finnish counterpart. \u201cWhen will our response follow? What will it be? That will depend on the final version of the draft law which is now being debated in the U.S. Senate.\u201d Putin also spoke about an ongoing diplomatic row between Moscow and Washington which erupted last December when then U.S. President Barack Obama ordered the seizure of Russian diplomatic property in the United States and the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats. \u201cThis goes beyond all reasonable bounds,\u201d said Putin. \u201cAnd now these sanctions - they are also absolutely unlawful from the point of view of international law.\u201d Calling the proposed sanctions \u201cextremely cynical,\u201d Putin said the demarche looked like an attempt by Washington to use its \u201cgeopolitical advantages ... to safeguard its economic interests at the expense of its allies\u201d. He dismissed Congressional investigations into Russia\u2019s alleged meddling in last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election, calling them a symptom of growing anti-Russian hysteria in the United States and a result of U.S. domestic politics. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad that U.S.-Russian relations are being sacrificed to resolve internal policy issues in the U.S,\u201d said Putin. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity, because acting together we could be solving jointly the most acute problems that worry the peoples of Russia and the United States much more efficiently.\u201d  However, Putin said that Moscow had \u201cmany friends\u201d in the United States and hoped that one day the situation would right itself.

Trump\u2019s plan could shift the U.S. economy into higher gear but could have one effect the White House would not welcome \u2014 interest rates ratcheted higher than expected by a wary central bank. The Trump tax cut will generate growth but not nearly enough to replace trillions of dollars in lost revenues, while rising deficits could even take back some of the economic gains, fiscal experts say. Congress inches toward a deal to fund the government through September but is preparing to possibly extend a midnight Friday deadline in order to wrap up negotiations and avoid an imminent government shutdown. Trump is considering issuing an executive order to pull the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement, an administration official says, a move that could unravel one of the world\u2019s biggest trading blocs. Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discuss bilateral trade in their second conversation in as many days  amid strains over softwood lumber and dairy. The Trump administration says it aims to push North Korea into dismantling its nuclear and missile programs through tougher international sanctions and diplomatic pressure, and remains open to negotiations to bring that about. Trump gives the military the authority to reset a confusing system of troop limits in Iraq and Syria that critics say allows the White House to micro-manage battlefield decisions and ultimately obscures the real number of U.S. forces. Trump signs an executive order to allow national monument designations to be rescinded or reduce the size of sites as the administration pushes to open more federal land to drilling, mining and other development. Trump orders Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to review the government role in school policy, which supporters cheer as a step in creating more local control in education and critics worry it could lead to lower quality schools in poorer neighborhoods.

It is a response to the new sanctions against Russia reluctantly signed into law last week by U.S. President Donald Trump. The sanctions targeted Russia\u2019s energy sector, with new limits on U.S. investment in Russian companies. \u201cWe will of course intensify work related to import substitution, reduction of dependence on U.S. payment systems, on the dollar as a settling currency and so on.

        "title": "Republicans aim to coax Trump toward House trade tax plan",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. Congress hope to convince President-elect Donald Trump to support an untested strategy of using the tax code to promote exports while slashing corporate taxes, framing it as a way to fulfill his campaign promises to restore blue-collar jobs. The plan would be one way to help Republican lawmakers reconcile their long-standing goal of tax cuts with the often populist campaign rhetoric of Trump, who has attacked the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other trade deals as bad for U.S. workers. Critics say it risks running afoul of global trade rules and increasing costs for U.S. consumers. Analysts also say that any export gains could be short-lived if the strategy causes the dollar to strengthen, wiping out any price advantage for U.S. products in international markets. It is likely to undergo months of debate as part of a larger package of proposals offered in congressional Republicans\u2019 \u201cA Better Way\u201d economic plan, but at least one Trump adviser already seems to have a favorable view of the export-focused \u201cborder adjustability\u201d strategy. \u201cIf we have a border adjustable tax system, that can solve a lot of these trade issues that Trump is talking about,\u201d economic analyst and Trump adviser Stephen Moore said in an interview. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tax what\u2019s imported and not going to tax what\u2019s exported. So we\u2019re going to reduce the trade deficit and we\u2019re going to have more companies come in here,\u201d Moore said. Border adjustability\u2019s details are not clearly explained in a summary of the \u201cA Better Way\u201d plan from House Speaker Paul Ryan and House tax committee chairman Kevin Brady. But the Tax Foundation, a think tank that closely studies business tax policy, said the strategy would be implemented by making revenue from sales to non-U.S. residents non-taxable, while preventing importers from deducting the cost of goods bought from non-residents. Brady told Reuters that border adjustability would \u201cvirtually eliminate\u201d any tax incentive for U.S. companies to move operations overseas and encourage foreign investment to return to the United States. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great argument, I think,\u201d he said. Steven Mnuchin, Trump\u2019s pick for U.S. Treasury secretary and co-author of the president-elect\u2019s tax plan, described tax reform on Wednesday as \u201csomething that happens absolutely within the first 90 days of this presidency.\u201d Wilbur Ross, Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, did not mention tax policy directly but said the Trump administration\u2019s aim would be to increase exports in part by getting rid of \u201cnon-tariff\u201d barriers. The perceived winners under a border adjustability approach would include U.S. manufacturers that export heavily, while large-volume importers, such as U.S. retailers, could be hurt. That distinction was already dividing corporate lobbying groups.  While retailers support an overhaul of the tax code, \u201cthe tax on imports\u00a0proposed in\u00a0the House blueprint\u00a0is\u00a0cause for concern for retailers,\u201d said Christin Fernandez, spokeswoman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a Washington group. The industry group\u2019s members include Wal Mart Stores Inc, Home Depot Inc and Target Corp. Some version of border adjustability could attract support from Democrats. Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat who sits on the Senate Finance Committee and the panel\u2019s tax subcommittee, said he strongly favors the idea. But he called the emerging House plan \u201cvery, very questionable\u201d because it would use tax on corporate income rather than a consumption tax. Tax lawyers and other experts have said such an approach risks violating long-standing world trade rules that allow countries to adjust their trading positions through indirect taxes, such as a sales tax, but not with direct taxes like the U.S. corporate tax.      \u201cIt would lead to uncertainty on how it would be treated internationally. And that\u2019s bad for business,\u201d Cardin told Reuters.      Trump\u2019s transition team and other Trump advisors on the economy did not respond to requests for comment. Brady has said border adjustability would pass muster with the World Trade Organization, which polices global trade. The WTO declined to comment on the plan. Border adjustability is only one component of the \u201cA Better Way\u201d blueprint. It would also slash the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from a top rate of 35 percent; repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax; and let businesses write off capital investments immediately. Altogether, the House Republicans\u2019 corporate tax plan would reduce U.S. corporate tax revenues by about $891 billion over 10 years, estimated the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, perpetuating a long-term decline in the corporate tax take. Combined with an equally ambitious package of individual income tax cut proposals put forward in the \u201cBetter Way\u201d package, the Republican plan would boost the federal deficit by about $3.7 trillion over a decade, the center estimated. Advocates of border adjustability note that U.S. trading partners including China use value-added taxes to favor exports over imports and say the House proposal would level the playing field for U.S. companies.  But some tax experts have questioned how effective it would be. Kyle Pomerleau and Stephen Entin of the Tax Foundation wrote in June that the increased demand abroad for cheaper U.S.-made goods would boost the dollar\u2019s value and cancel out gains for exporters. Still, supporters of the plan believe it could win the favor of the president-elect, who has railed against U.S. companies that have shifted production abroad and scaled back U.S. operations. Trump has already ruled out U.S. participation in the ambitious Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal and has vowed to renegotiate or quit NAFTA. \u201cWhen Trump understands how the blueprint works, particularly the border adjustability provision, which will create a huge incentive to make stuff in the United States, I think he\u2019ll be delirious,\u201d said Ken Kies, one of Washington\u2019s most influential corporate tax lobbyists.

        "title": "Clinton leads Trump by eight points: Reuters/Ipsos poll",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton leads Republican rival Donald Trump by 8 percentage points among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday. The Aug. 14-18 survey showed 42 percent of Americans supported Clinton ahead of the Nov. 8 general election. That compares with 34 percent support for Trump. Another 23 percent of likely voters would not pick either candidate.  Clinton has led Trump in the poll throughout most of the 2016 campaign, and has maintained her advantage following last month\u2019s Republican and Democratic conventions. Since late July, support for the former secretary of state has ranged between 41 percent and 44 percent of likely voters, while Trump\u2019s support has varied between 33 percent and 39 percent. The race was tighter at this point in the 2012 election, with Democratic President Barack Obama ahead of Republican nominee Mitt Romney by less than 2 percentage points.     Clinton also led a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that asked people to choose between Clinton, Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party. Some 41 percent supported Clinton and 34 percent supported Trump. Among alternative-party candidates, Johnson came in third with 7 percent and about 2 percent supported Stein.  Clinton and Trump have both struggled to inspire American voters this year. According to the poll, neither candidate is regarded favorably by most Americans, and two-thirds of U.S. adults believe the country is on the wrong track.  Clinton continues to face questions about her handling of classified emails while serving as Obama\u2019s secretary of state, while Trump\u2019s off-the-cuff remarks about immigrants, women and Muslims have rankled members of his own party. Republican leaders, including former members of Congress, have called for the Republican National Committee to stop helping Trump and refocus its resources on helping candidates win down-ballot races for the House of Representatives and the Senate. Earlier this week, Trump reshuffled his campaign leadership while his campaign chief, Paul Manafort, faced increased scrutiny over his work with pro-Russian political groups in the Ukraine. Manafort resigned on Friday. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It surveyed samples of 1,119 and 1,118 likely voters, respectively, and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. ",

        "title": "Trump replaces chief of staff Priebus with retired General Kelly",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump replaced his beleaguered White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, after only six months on the job on Friday, installing retired General John Kelly in his place in a major shake-up of his top team. Trump announced the move in a tweet a day after his new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, accused Priebus of leaking information to reporters in a profanity-laced tirade.  Kelly, 67, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, is currently secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and will assume the chief of staff post on Monday. He was hired with the goal of bringing more discipline to the White House, a senior White House official said. Trump issued his decision just as he landed aboard Air Force One after a visit to Long Island and hours after Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare failed in the Senate. Priebus was on the plane with the Republican president and made no comment. Reporters had noticed no sign of stress from Priebus during the day.Priebus told CNN he had been talking to Trump for some time about exiting the White House, and is the latest in a long line of officials to leave or not take a job at the White House. \u201cThe president has a right to hit a reset button. I think it\u2019s time to hit the reset button,\u201d Priebus said in a televised interview from the White House. \u201cHe intuitively determined that it was time to do something different, and I think he\u2019s right.\u201d Trump had lost confidence in Priebus, privately questioning his competence after major legislative items failed to pass the U.S. Congress, a Trump confidant said. A source close to Priebus said the former Republican National Committee chairman turned in his resignation on Thursday night, after Scaramucci\u2019s rant against him was published by the New Yorker magazine. A senior White House official said Trump had informed Priebus two weeks ago that he would be replacing him and that the move had no connection to Scaramucci, whose hiring a week ago prompted Sean Spicer, a Priebus ally, to abruptly resign as press secretary. After frequent conversations with Kelly, Trump recently warmed up to the idea of naming Kelly chief of staff to more effectively manage personnel and offered it to him earlier this week, a senior White House official said. Carrying an umbrella, Trump approached reporters as he stepped off Air Force One, with rain storming down. \u201cReince is a good man. John Kelly will do a fantastic job. General Kelly has been a star, done an incredible job thus far, respected by everybody. He\u2019s a great, great American. Reince is a good man,\u201d Trump said. Priebus\u2019 189-day tenure was the shortest in modern history for a White House chief of staff. He had hoped to stay on at least a year but struggled to manage his unpredictable boss and was unable to get a handle on conflicting factions in the White House who have frequently squabbled. In a statement, Priebus said it had been one of the great honors of his life to serve Trump and the country. \u201cI will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the president\u2019s agenda and policies. I can\u2019t think of a better person than General John Kelly to succeed me and I wish him God\u2019s blessings and great success,\u201d he said.    Trump loyalists had chafed at Priebus, feeling he had installed his RNC allies at the White House and overlooked the people close to Trump who helped get him elected president in November. But Priebus allies felt he was an important link to establishment Republicans in Washington as the capital attempted to adjust to the anti-establishment style of the president. \u201cHe has served the president and the American people capably and passionately,\u201d House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said of his close friend in a statement. \u201cHe has achieved so much, and he has done it all with class. I could not be more proud to call Reince a dear friend.\u201d White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she did not think Priebus\u2019 exit would affect the White House\u2019s relationship with the Republican Party. \u201cI think we\u2019ve still got a good relationship. We\u2019re going to continue working with the party and doing what we came here to do,\u201d she said. Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Elaine Duke will become the acting chief of the department on Monday, DHS said in a statement. U.S. Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, is among those being considered for Homeland Security secretary, a DHS official said.  ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A compromise Republican tax bill released late Friday does not eliminate a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit as Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives had previously proposed. The measure follows the lead of the Senate version approved last month that did not eliminate the credit. Killing the credit could have hurt automakers like General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T). Consumers under current law are eligible for a $7,500 tax credit to defray the cost of plug-in electric vehicles. The electric vehicle tax credit starts to phase out after a manufacturer sells 200,000 plug-in vehicles. After an automaker hits that point, the $7,500 tax credit is still available for at least three more months before phasing out.  Consumers are currently allowed to take the credit on vehicles until the manufacturer hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles. The Electric Drive Transportation Association said in a statement late Friday it was pleased the credit would remain in law. \u201cThe credit supports innovation and job creation while helping drivers access advanced vehicle technology,\u201d the group said. More than 50 automakers and other companies and groups released a letter earlier this week urging Congress to retain the credit, including Ford Motor Co (F.N), BMW AG (BMWG.DE), GM, Uber Technologies Inc. Former President Barack Obama repeatedly proposed hiking the tax credit for electric vehicles to $10,000 and converting it to a point-of-sale rebate, but Congress did not approve the measure. Automakers face mandates from California and a dozen other states to produce a rising number of zero-emission vehicles and have said the credits are essential to meeting requirements. ",

        "title": "Senate leaders look to work with White House to block Moore",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that he wanted to work with the White House to explore ways to keep embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore from taking office if he wins a special election in Alabama. Speaking to reporters at the U.S. Capitol, McConnell said he had been in contact with President Donald Trump and others about sexual misconduct allegations against Moore. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously not fit to be in the United States Senate,\u201d McConnell said, \u201cand we\u2019ve looked at all the options to try and prevent that from happening.\u201d Five women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct stemming from when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. Moore, now 70, has denied the allegations.  Trump returns to Washington on Tuesday evening from a 12-day trip to Asia, and McConnell said he planned to discuss Moore\u2019s situation with the president. Both are Republicans.  McConnell said he had also spoken with Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly about Moore. Trump supported Moore\u2019s opponent, Luther Strange, in the Republican primary but threw his support to Moore after Strange was defeated. McConnell said Republicans were still considering having a candidate launch a write-in campaign against Moore for the Dec. 12 special election. Speculation has centered on Strange and the current U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, as possibilities. McConnell said later in the day that Sessions, who left the Senate seat to become attorney general, would be a plausible write-in candidate. \u201cHe fits the mold of somebody who might be able to pull off a write-in,\u201d the majority leader said during a forum on the economy.  Before the allegations surfaced, Moore, a Christian conservative and former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice,  had been heavily favored to defeat Democrat Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney. A Democratic win in Alabama would be a blow to Trump\u2019s agenda and shift the political outlook for next year\u2019s congressional elections, giving Democrats a stronger shot at recapturing control of the Senate. Under state law, Moore cannot be removed from the ballot. \u201cObviously this close to the election, it\u2019s a very complicated matter,\u201d McConnell said earlier. Moore has suggested that McConnell and other establishment Republicans were working in tandem with news media to discredit him.  After McConnell\u2019s remarks, Moore responded by tweeting: \u201cThe good people of Alabama, not the Washington elite who wallow in the swamp, will decide this election!\u201d McConnell urged Moore on Monday to leave the race, while Senator Cory Gardner, who chairs the Republican Party\u2019s Senate campaign arm, suggested the Senate should expel Moore should he continue campaigning and win.  The Republican National Committee has withdrawn its support for Moore, according to a Federal Election Commission filing on Tuesday, after the party\u2019s Senate campaign wing, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, ended a fundraising deal with him on Friday.  In Birmingham, Alabama, Jones told reporters his campaign had no plans to directly attack Moore over the allegations in a bid to capitalize on the furor. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay in our lane. We\u2019re going to talk about the issues that we continue to talk about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will bring up his record, his previous record, other people will bring up the issues of the day. And people will have a choice.\u201d Jones\u2019 campaign released a new ad on Tuesday featuring Republican voters who say they are backing the Democrat. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican, but Roy Moore - no way,\u201d one voter says in the ad. The national Democratic Party, however, has yet to invest directly in the race beyond funds to build the state party, and has not changed that stance since the Moore allegations surfaced. Earlier in the day, Sessions said in testimony before Congress that he had no reason to doubt the five women who have accused Moore of misconduct when they were in their teens. The House of Representatives\u2019 top Republican, Speaker Paul Ryan, said he believed Moore\u2019s accusers and that Moore should leave the race.  \u201cIf he cares about the values and people he claims to care about, then he should step aside,\u201d Ryan told a news conference. On Monday, Beverly Young Nelson became the fifth woman to accuse Moore of misconduct, saying he sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s. Moore said on Monday that Nelson\u2019s accusations were \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d Moore has denied the allegations first raised in a Washington Post story about his relationships with four women when they were teenagers, including a charge he initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s. Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations and accusations.  ",

The proposal would offer experienced workers who now make less than $50,000 a form of wage insurance, allowing them to replace half of their lost pay. The benefit would cover up to $10,000 over two years. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to give families some stability and encourage folks to rejoin the workforce - because we shouldn\u2019t just be talking about unemployment; we should be talking about re-employment,\u201d Obama said in his weekly radio and Internet address, broadcast on Saturday.

Details about the program\u2019s proposed funding will be further outlined in Obama\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2017 expected to be released next month. Obama promised in his State of the Union earlier this week to advocate for legislative action on issues with bipartisan support during his last year in office. During the address, he pointed to wage insurance as one measure where lawmakers may be able to work together. The White House plan would require states to provide insurance for workers laid off from jobs they had held for at least three years. The plan would be federally-funded, but it would be administered through state unemployment insurance programs. Other measures proposed by the White House on Saturday included a requirement that all states provide at least 26 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits, and the creation of a permanent program that would automatically provide up to 52 additional weeks of federally-funded benefits for states experiencing rapid job-losses or high unemployment.

Lawyers for the companies had said $750 million in potential tax refunds in California and additional amounts in other states were at stake in the case.

That is eight short of the number needed to trigger a party leadership contest, the mechanism through which May could be forced from office and replaced by another Conservative. May has been struggling to maintain her authority over her party since a snap election on June 8 which she called thinking she would win by a wide margin but instead resulted in her losing her parliamentary majority.

Mylan has been widely criticized, including by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, for raising the price of EpiPens, which are carried by people with life-threatening allergies. The company, which acquired the product in 2007, recently raised the list price for a pair of EpiPen auto-injectors to $600. The price has been rising from a cost of about $100 in 2008. A probe into EpiPen pricing by a U.S. Senate subcommittee was announced on Sept. 7. Brown\u2019s decision on Friday highlights the predicament facing allergy advocates, who strongly support epinephrine access legislation but have criticized Mylan\u2019s pricing.  Over two dozen U.S. states have passed laws similar to California\u2019s authorizing businesses to stock epinephrine, according to advocacy group Food Allergy Research & Education.  Brown said he was signing the bill because EpiPens save lives, but that he strongly objected to Mylan\u2019s pricing. \u201cState government cannot stop unconscionable price increases, but it can shed light on such rapacious corporate behavior,\u201d Brown said in a statement. A Mylan representative could not immediately be reached for comment.

        "title": "France's Macron urges continued EU ties with Turkey",
        "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said Turkey remained a vital partner of the European Union and ties should be maintained even if the country had strayed from the EU path, according to a newspaper interview published on Thursday. A senior Turkish official said EU states must decide whether they wanted Turkey as a member, but there was a sense  they no longer want the marriage...(but) want cohabitation . Comments from the French president followed German Chancellor Angela Merkel s remarks in a television debate on Sunday that the EU should halt membership talks with Ankara.  Turkey has indeed strayed away from the European Union in recent months and worryingly overstepped the mark in ways that cannot be ignored,  Macron told Greece s Kathimerini newspaper.  But I want to avoid a split because it s a vital partner in many crises we all face, notably the immigration challenge and the terrorist threat.  The EU is eager to preserve a deal with Turkey that has stemmed the mass migration via Turkish territory of people from conflict areas. Turkey has in the past questioned the EU s sincerity in keeping its side of the arrangement.  Relations with Ankara and the European Union have deteriorated since a failed July 2016 coup that has been followed by the arrests of tens of thousands of people across the country. Critics accuse President Tayyip Erdogan of using the coup attempt as pretext for a reckoning political opponents. Turkey, which signed an association agreement with the EU in 1963, began formal negotiations to join the union in 2005. However, several members, including France, have opposed talks on certain subjects meaning that only 16 negotiation chapters out of 35 have been opened.  Speaking to reporters in Paris, Turkey s ambassador echoed President Erdogan s comments that the EU had to make its mind up about membership and dismissed any notion of an alternative  special partnership .  Integrating Turkey into the EU is not a Turkish question, but a European question now. Of course we have the impression of being duped,  Ismail Hakki Musa told reporters in Paris.   They no longer want the marriage they want cohabitation. For a privileged partnership it s too late and Europe must now be honest and sincere.   Turkey s relationship with France is not as bad as that with Germany, but ties have been strained following the arrest of French journalists in the country. The most recent, Loup Bureau, was seized by Turkish border guards on the frontier with Iraq in early August. Musa said Macron and Erdogan had asked their respective interior and justice ministers to find a way to solve the problem.    We have to find a solution without tainting the fundamentals of the Turkish system,  he said. France s foreign minister is due in Ankara on Sept. 14.   Finland s Foreign Minister Timo Soini, arriving in Brussels for talks with counterparts, said he was against ending membership talks with Turkey.  It s always useful to have a dialogue. We know there are problems with human rights in Turkey.  While Macron has sought not to anger Erdogan since taking office, when responding in an interview last month on why being on the world stage was not so easy, Macron appeared to take a veiled swipe at the Turkish president.       I am the one who has to talk with Erdogan every 10 days,  he told Le Point without elaborating. ",

        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The European Union on Thursday condemned the killing of a female Mexican prosecutor who specialized in violence against women, as the country grapples with its worst murder rate in two decades, including a spate of attacks on rights workers and reporters.   Yendi Guadalupe Torres Castellanos, a prosecutor in the state of Veracruz whose remit included violence against women as well as sexual and family-related crimes, was killed Monday in her car in the city of Panuco, according to the state government.       This murder demonstrates once more the troubling level of violence that devastates Mexico, including violence against human rights defenders,  the EU s Mexican delegation said in a joint statement with Swiss and Norwegian ambassadors.  Earlier this month, unknown gunmen shot dead Silvestre de la Toba, the head of the Baja California Sur state human rights commission.  And, after a spate of killings of reporters, a United Nations team of experts on freedom of expression is currently visiting Mexico to assess the safety of journalists. Torres  death was also denounced by the Veracruz government, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and the U.S. ambassador to Mexico.  October was the most violent since the Mexican government began tracking such crimes two decades ago.

        "title": "China urges U.S. to block transit by Taiwan president",
        "text": "BEIJING/GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - China called on U.S. officials on Tuesday not to let Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen pass through the United States en route to Guatemala next month, days after President-elect Donald Trump irked Beijing by speaking to Tsai in a break with decades of precedent. The U.S. State Department appeared to reject the call, saying that such transits were based on \u201clong-standing U.S. practice, consistent with the unofficial nature of (U.S.) relations with Taiwan.\u201d China is deeply suspicious of Tsai, whom it thinks wants to push for the formal independence of Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing regards as a renegade province. Her call with Trump on Friday was the first between a U.S. president-elect or president and a Taiwanese leader since President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan in 1979. Tsai is due to visit Guatemala, one of Taiwan\u2019s small band of diplomatic allies, on Jan. 11-12, its foreign minister, Carlos Raul Morales, told Reuters. Taiwan\u2019s Liberty Times, considered close to Tsai\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive Party, reported on Monday that she was planning to go through New York early next month on her way to  Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador. Taiwan has not formally confirmed Tsai\u2019s trip but visits to its allies in the region are normally combined with transit stops in the United States and meetings with Taiwan-friendly officials. The trip would take place before Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20 to replace Democrat Barack Obama and Tsai\u2019s delegation would seek to meet Trump\u2019s team, including his White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, the Liberty Times said. An adviser to Trump\u2019s transition team said he considered it \u201cvery unlikely\u201d there would be a meeting between Tsai and Trump if she were to go through New York. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the one-China principle, which states Taiwan is part of China, was commonly recognized by the international community and that Tsai\u2019s real aim was \u201cself-evident.\u201d China hopes the United States \u201cdoes not allow her transit, and does not send any wrong signals to \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 forces,\u201d the ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said on Monday he had no information whether Tsai would meet U.S. officials if she stopped in transit but said Taiwanese presidents did stop over  periodically.  He said the transits were \u201cbased on long-standing U.S. practice, consistent with the unofficial nature of our relations with Taiwan.\u201d A spokeswoman repeated the position on Tuesday when asked to comment on the Chinese call. In a meeting with American reporters on Tuesday, Tsai played down the significance of her conversation with Trump, saying it was to congratulate the president-elect. \u201cI do not foresee major policy shifts in the near future because we all see the value of stability in the region,\u201d she  told the reporters. U.S. Vice President-elect Mike Pence told the Fox News Channel on Tuesday that Trump did not regret taking the call. \u201c(The) president-elect was fully aware of the one-China policy,\u201d Pence said. \u201cHe\u2019s also very aware that the United States has sold billions of dollars in arms to Taiwan. \u201cWe have a unique relationship with that country that\u2019s been defined over the decades since we\u2019ve reopened relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China but I think he think he felt it would be rude not to take the call.\u201d Taiwan has been self governing since 1949 when Nationalist forces fled to the island after defeat by Mao Zedong\u2019s communists in China\u2019s civil war. Taiwan\u2019s Presidential Office said media reports about a January trip were \u201cexcessive speculation.\u201d El Salvador\u2019s government said it was working with Taiwan on plans for a visit by Tsai in the second week of January but gave no specific dates. The Nicaraguan government had no immediate comment. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega is to be sworn in for a third consecutive term on Jan. 10, however, so Tsai\u2019s trip to Guatemala would dovetail with that ceremony. The White House said on Monday it had sought to reassure China after Trump\u2019s phone call with Tsai, which the Obama administration warned could undermine progress in relations with Beijing. ",

        "title": "Little prospect of Syria peace progress seen in Geneva talks",
        "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - A breakthrough in U.N.-backed Syria peace talks in Geneva this week seems hardly more likely than in seven failed earlier rounds as President Bashar al-Assad pushes for total military victory and his opponents stick by their demand he leave power.  U.N. Syria mediator Staffan de Mistura said on Monday the Syrian government had not yet confirmed that it would attend the talks. A Syrian newspaper reported that the government delegation would delay its planned Tuesday arrival in Geneva because of the opposition s insistence Assad step down. The opposition s stance is seen by Damascus and its allies as divorced from reality after the government s steady march of victories since Russia entered the war in 2015. The rebels have been forced from all Syria s big cities and their hopes of toppling Assad by military means look finished. The opposition has also accused the government of refusing to seriously engage.  The Assad regime must not be allowed to play for time while people are being besieged and bombed,  Yahya al-Aridi, newly appointed head of the opposition s negotiating committee, said on Sunday. Aridi was chosen last week after the opposition rejigged its negotiations committee - jettisoning as its leader a more hardline opponent of Assad in what some speculated might be a move towards softening its position. But the statement it put out after meeting on Friday reiterated its demand that Assad go before the start of a political transition under any peace deal. Last week a senior Assad adviser said talks could succeed only if rebels laid down their arms. Over the weekend, air strikes on the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta district near Damascus intensified, killing 41 people on Sunday and Monday, according to a war monitor.   You cannot expect very much,  said Nikolaos Van Dam, a former Dutch diplomat in Damascus and author of two books about Syria.   The regime doesn t want to really negotiate. They want to reconquer every inch of Syrian territory and then negotiate. But then the opposition would have no bargaining chips,  he said. The Syrian civil war, now in its seventh year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and caused the world s worst refugee crisis, driving 11 million from their homes. All previous diplomatic initiatives have swiftly collapsed over the opposition demand that Assad leave power and his refusal to go. Troops from Russia, Iran, Turkey and the United States, as well as Shi ite militias from Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan, have all now joined arrived on the battlefield.  Russia has pushed its own parallel track of diplomacy since early this year, bringing together Assad s other main ally Iran, and Turkey, which has been one of the biggest rebel supporters.  Russia has elections next year and President Vladimir Putin wants to show progress towards a political deal after two years of fighting far from Russian soil. Moscow has already said it will bring many troops home from Syria by the end of the year.  Putin may also seek to tout diplomatic progress as he angles for the West to take some of the burden of Syria s post-war reconstruction, now likely to fall on Russia, Iran and China.  Western foreign ministers said in September their support hinges on a  credible political process leading to a genuine political transition , a process they have said requires the involvement of the opposition.   Russia wants the end of the war but it wants its ally intact. So what would be the compromise that is acceptable to the opposition or to the other countries? It s not clear to me,  said Van Dam. Moscow now plans a  Syrian Congress , bringing together the government and some opposition groups to write a new constitution leading to elections. The main opposition rejects the idea, saying all talks must come under the United Nations. But the government has said it backs the congress, as has Turkey, which has some sway over rebel groups in the northwest.   There is an acceleration in the political solution on the basis of a unified Syria headed by Bashar al-Assad, with amendments to the constitution and in the election law,  a senior, pro-Assad official in the region said. The Syrian government declared on Sunday it would support the formation of a committee that will discuss the constitution and is expected to be set up at the congress. It also said it would support U.N. participation in legislative elections to be held after that discussion.  Ultimately Russia s objective is to dress up a limited military victory for the Assad regime and the Iranians in Syria as a diplomatic one,  said Andrew Tabler, a Syria specialist at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think-tank.  Because the regime and the Iranians don t have the manpower to completely occupy all Syria, or to rebuild Syria, or the money to rebuild Syria, they need international buy-in,  he said.  I don t think it will be easy for them because the United States and others know what they are trying to do.  This week s Geneva talks will focus on the issues of elections and a constitution, Ramzi Ramzi, the deputy United Nations special envoy for Syria said in Damascus on Saturday. De Mistura said on Monday negotiations should take place at Geneva and without any preconditions, and  all other initiatives should support the U.N. mediation process.  After recapturing the last major rebel urban stronghold in East Aleppo a year ago, and advancing across central and eastern Syria against Islamic State this year, the government now controls far more territory than any other force in the country.  But rebels still hold a swathe of northwest Syria next to Turkey, and an enclave in the southwest near Israel and Jordan. They have other pockets near Damascus and Homs.  Kurdish groups and allied Arab militia backed by the United States also hold the northeast and are holding elections there this week for local councils in an effort to cement autonomy.  They have not been invited to the Geneva talks and are regarded by Syria s neighbor Turkey as enemies. Assad has sworn to recover all of his state, and visiting Iranian officials have indicated that new military campaigns may soon start against both the rebels and the Kurds. ",

        "title": "Obama scolds Senate Republicans for Supreme Court threat",
        "text": "RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday vowed to pick an indisputably qualified nominee for the Supreme Court and chided Republicans who control the U.S. Senate for threatening to block him from filling the pivotal vacancy. Obama told senators he has a constitutional duty to nominate a new justice after Saturday\u2019s death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and reminded them of their constitutional obligation to \u201cdo their job\u201d and vote to approve or reject his nominee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the seat on the nation\u2019s highest court should remain vacant until Obama\u2019s successor takes office in January so voters can have a say on the selection when they cast ballots in the Nov. 8 presidential election. \u201cI\u2019m amused when I hear people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution suddenly reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe Constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now,\u201d Obama, a former constitutional law professor, told a news conference at the close of a two-day meeting with leaders from Southeast Asia. In Washington, Scalia\u2019s chair in the court\u2019s ornate chamber was draped with black wool crepe in accordance with court tradition following a justice\u2019s death. The court said Scalia\u2019s body will lie in repose at the Supreme Court building on Friday before his funeral Mass at the  Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington on Saturday. Obama\u2019s nominee could shift the balance of power on the court, which had five conservatives and four liberals before Scalia\u2019s death. The president said he understood the high stakes for Republican senators under pressure to vote against his pick for the lifetime appointment, who conceivably would be the deciding vote in cases where the court is split. Obama said the \u201cvenom and rancor in Washington\u201d has led to the Senate routinely blocking his nominations for lower courts and other posts but said the Supreme Court is too important to get trapped in political gridlock.  \u201cIt\u2019s the one court where we would expect elected officials to rise above day-to-day politics,\u201d he said. But Republicans have pointed out that Obama and members of his cabinet, who were then in the Senate, were not above trying to block the Supreme Court nomination of Justice Samuel Alito by then-President George W. Bush in 2006. \u201cWhile he complained about filibusters today, he joined filibusters while in the Senate,\u201d said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Asked about his record, Obama acknowledged Democrats have played politics with nominations, too, through what he described as \u201cstrategic decisions\u201d that ultimately did not block the president\u2019s nominee. \u201cBut what is also true is Justice Alito is on the bench right now,\u201d Obama said. Obama shed little light on whom he would choose or how the White House will try to finesse his choice through Congress. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find somebody who is an outstanding legal mind, somebody who cares deeply about our democracy and cares about rule of law,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019m going to present somebody who indisputably is qualified for the seat, and any fair-minded person, even somebody who disagrees with my politics, would say would serve with honor and integrity on the court,\u201d he added. Asked directly if that meant he would choose a moderate candidate, Obama said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said there was \u201cmore than enough time\u201d for the Senate to hold hearings and vote on his nominee without the White House needing to resort to a procedure known as a recess appointment to get around the Senate when it is not in session. But he did not explicitly rule out a recess appointment. Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, whose panel weighs Supreme Court nominations, said on Tuesday he will wait until Obama names his pick to fill the vacancy before deciding whether to hold confirmation hearings. Grassley has offered mixed messages since Scalia\u2019s death on how the Senate should proceed on the vacancy, alternating hardline views on blocking any nominee with comments not ruling out hearings.  \u201cI would wait until the nominee is made before I would make any decisions\u201d about confirmation hearings, Grassley said, according to Radio Iowa. \u201cIn other words, take it a step at a time.\u201d ",

        "title": "German women ask Merkel for more support after vote",
        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - A group of German women s organizations wrote to Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday demanding more support for their goals of equal participation, equal pay and better monitoring of gender policies after the Sept. 24 election. Merkel was elected as Germany s first female chancellor in 2005, helped by strong support from women voters, but the leader of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) has not made fighting for equal rights a major priority.   Women in Germany have moderated their demands for long enough and repeatedly accepted compromises. Without notable progress,  wrote the 17 groups representing 12.5 million women in professions ranging from medicine to law and engineering.  Now, new, binding milestones with clear targets need to be defined and achieved.  Opinion polls show that Merkel should easily win a fourth term, with women still more likely to vote for the CDU than the SPD, and far more likely to support Merkel   on 60 percent   than her SPD challenger Martin Schulz   on just 20 percent. Merkel was initially opposed to quotas, but her government  has introduced a requirement for women to hold 30 percent of seats on non-executive company boards after it was championed by her junior coalition partners, the center-left Social Democrats. Beyond that, however, progress at boosting female representation in both business and politics has been slow. None of Germany s top 30 listed companies has a female CEO and women hold only 7 percent of executive positions in the 160 biggest listed firms, up from 6 percent in 2016. Meanwhile, the percentage of women in the German parliament is expected to fall to 32 percent from a current 36.5 percent after the election due to the likely entry of the male-dominated Free Democrats and Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD). Merkel says she wants half her new cabinet to be female, compared to seven out of 16 posts now, although that will depend on which party she shares power with. She has also warned firms they face tougher regulation if they do not promote more women. The women s groups said they welcomed Merkel s desire for an equal cabinet and for more women in business, but said more was needed to improve participation and equal pay.  The example of the mandatory gender quota for supervisory boards of large companies shows that legal targets are needed to speed up the necessary processes of change and a switch in role models in business and society,  the letter to Merkel said.

        "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Frauke Petry, co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany, said on Tuesday she was leaving the party in a major blow to its credibility just two days after it surged to third place in a national election. The anti-immigrant AfD won 12.6 percent of the vote in Germany\u2019s election on Sunday, becoming the third-largest group in parliament and the first from the far-right to win seats in the Bundestag since the 1950s.  Petry, the highest-profile figure in the AfD\u2019s more moderate wing, had shocked other senior members by saying on Monday she would not sit with the AfD in the Bundestag (lower house) but rather as an independent member of parliament. Her husband, another senior AfD figure, is also leaving the party.  \u201cWe tried to change course but you have to realize when you reach a point when that is no longer possible,\u201d Petry, a 42-year-old chemist, told reporters in the eastern city of Dresden. \u201cI have five children for whom I am responsible and ultimately you have to be able to look yourself in the mirror.\u201d Petry has clashed with other senior members, arguing for the party to take a more moderate course to make it possible for it to join a coalition government. Her husband, Marcus Pretzell - head of the AfD in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and also an MP in the European Parliament - is quitting the party and will become an independent MP, a spokesman for the AfD in NRW said. The spokesman said Pretzell and another AfD lawmaker in NRW\u2019s regional assembly who is also leaving the party had made the decision for reasons of \u201cpersonal integrity\u201d. On Monday, four of the 17 AfD lawmakers in the assembly of the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern announced they were bolting because the party had become more radical. Europe\u2019s far-right parties have a history of infighting among their various factions. Marine Le Pen, leader of France\u2019s National Front, last week lost her deputy over policy differences.  Alexander Gauland and Alice Weidel, the AfD\u2019s top candidates during the election campaign, were elected as chairs of the party\u2019s parliamentary group on Tuesday. Gauland is a supporter of Bjoern Hoecke, a senior AfD member who has courted controversy by denying that Adolf Hitler was \u201cabsolutely evil\u201d and calling Berlin\u2019s Holocaust Memorial a \u201cmonument of shame\u201d. Weidel was originally an opponent of Hoecke but has not been so critical of him lately. Weidel said she did not expect other lawmakers to quit the party but added: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see. The step surprised us all, but there are not yet any trends recognizable in the future parliamentary group.\u201d Senior AfD member Dirk Driesang, who in July founded a moderate group within the AfD called the \u201cAlternative Centre\u201d, with which Petry was said to sympathize, told news magazine Der Spiegel that the group could not understand Petry\u2019s decision and would not be following in her footsteps. He said the group would continue to fight for the AfD to take a moderate course and added that \u201ca spin-off from the AfD is a stillbirth\u201d. Driesang pointed to the example of Bernd Lucke, who founded the AfD then left in 2015 due to what he saw as rising xenophobia and then formed a new, unsuccessful party. Petry was the most recognizable face in the AfD during its swift rise over the past two years. But she said on Monday she could not stand with an \u201canarchistic party\u201d that lacked a credible plan to govern. For months, Petry has urged the AfD to soften its stance and prepare to join coalition governments, while others wanted the party to stick to opposition. Mainstream parties refuse to work with the AfD. She had also distanced herself from some of the AfD\u2019s more radical senior members, saying their comments were putting voters off. Gauland caused a scandal during the election campaign by saying Germans should be proud of their World War Two soldiers. He also said the integration minister should be \u201cdisposed of\u201d in Turkey, where her parents come from. As the AfD convened in Berlin on Tuesday for its first parliamentary group meeting, Gauland said discussions in the Bundestag would not echo those of the party\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the talks during the campaign are different to those held in parliament,\u201d he said.

        "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish court has ordered the release of a parliamentarian who was the former spokesman for Turkey s pro-Kurdish opposition party, a party official said on Friday. The court ruled that Ayhan Bilgen be released after a monthly review of his detention since he was arrested in the southern city of Diyarbakir over accusations that he was a member of an armed terrorist group, the official told Reuters. Bilgen had served as spokesman and head of the pro-Kurdish Peoples  Democratic Party s (HDP) parliamentary group. The ruling comes amid growing concern among opposition parties, human rights groups and Turkey s Western allies that President Tayyip Erdogan is using a crackdown on suspected supporters of last year s failed coup to muzzle dissent. Since the failed coup, some 50,000 people have been arrested and more than 150,000 sacked or suspended from the military, civil service and private sector.     Nine HDP deputies are jailed pending trial, more than 70 elected mayors from the HDP s southeastern affiliate have been remanded in custody in terrorism-related investigations, and their municipalities taken over by state officials. Thousands of party members have also been arrested. The Turkish government says the HDP is an affiliate of the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency against the Turkish state and is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The HDP denies direct links. Turkey s parliament has also stripped four HDP lawmakers, including the party s co-chairwoman Figen Yuksekdag, of their parliamentary status, reducing the presence of the country s third-largest party in the 550-seat assembly. The HDP had 59 lawmakers elected to parliament in the November 2015 general election. The party s co-leader Selahattin Demirtas has also been in jail since November 2016.

        "title": "Trump may discuss secretary of state job with critic Romney: source",
        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump planned a Saturday meeting with Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and fierce Trump critic, and may discuss whether he should be a candidate for secretary of state, a source familiar with the meeting said on Thursday. Trump already has a lengthy list of potential candidates for the post of top U.S. diplomat, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, U.S. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who met Trump on Thursday. Trump, a former reality TV star, has shown a flair for the dramatic in his deliberations over his Cabinet, saying only he knows who \u201cthe finalists\u201d are. Corker told CNN on Wednesday he was \u201cin the mix\u201d for the position but that Trump might pick someone who was closer to him during the presidential campaign. He met on Thursday in Washington with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Trump\u2019s expected meeting with Romney amounts to an olive branch of sorts to one of his sharpest critics. Romney, who in a speech in March called Trump \u201ca phony, a fraud,\u201d urged Republicans to vote for anyone but the New York real estate magnate while the party was picking its presidential nominee. Trump, in turn, used harsh rhetoric at times during his campaign to dismiss Romney as a failure who blew a chance in 2012 to defeat Democratic President Barack Obama, whom Trump felt was a weak opponent. The source told Reuters that a broad discussion was expected during the meeting and that discussion about the secretary of state position was possible. The source had said earlier his understanding was that the meeting would occur on Sunday. Asked about the meeting, Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway suggested it was still being arranged. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it,\u201d she said.  \u201cI think it\u2019s good that the president-elect is meeting with people like Mr. Romney,\u201d U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, one of Trump\u2019s closest confidants and a potential nominee for defense secretary, told reporters at Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower. Sessions sounded far from certain Romney would be offered a job. \u201cThere are a lot of talented people that he (Trump) needs good relationships with. And I think Mr. Romney would be quite capable of doing a number of things. But he will be one of those, I am sure, that\u2019s reviewed. Donald Trump will make that decision,\u201d Sessions said. When Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, opted out of running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, people close to him suggested that serving as secretary of state might be appealing to him if a Republican won the presidency. A steady stream of potential Trump administration hires made their way through the lobby of Trump Tower to meet with either Trump or officials close to him. All indicated a willingness to serve, such as Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. He is a potential treasury secretary in the Trump administration. \u201cI stand ready to help the president in any capacity possible. I\u2019ve got a great position in public policy today, if he wants to talk to me obviously, about serving somewhere else, we\u2019ll look at serving somewhere else,\u201d he told reporters. ",

        "title": "Trump and Duterte bond at Asia summit; U.S. says discussed rights",
        "text": "MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he had a  great relationship  with his Philippine counterpart, Rodrigo Duterte, while a White House official said human rights got only a brief mention when the two met on the sidelines of an Asian summit. A spokesman for Duterte said there was no mention at all of human rights or extrajudicial killings during their conversation.  The meeting between the two presidents was one of the most anticipated at the summit of East and Southeast Asian leaders in Manila, with human rights groups pressing Trump to take a tough line on Duterte over his bloody war on drugs, in which thousands of people have been killed.  The conversation focused on ISIS (Islamic State), illegal drugs, and trade,  said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.  Human rights briefly came up in the context of the Philippines  fight against illegal drugs.  Duterte s spokesman, Harry Roque, told a news conference the Philippine president had explained his antidrug policy at length to Trump, who  seemed to be appreciative of his efforts.   There was no mention of human rights, no mention of extralegal killings,  he said. A joint statement released later by the White House listed human rights as the third of 14 topics discussed.  The two sides underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs to promote the welfare of all sectors, including the most vulnerable groups,  the statement said. They discussed the Philippine campaign against crime, including illegal drugs, it said, and  committed to share best practices in the areas of prevention; enforcement, including capacity-building and transparency in investigations; and rehabilitation.   More than 3,900 people have been killed in a war on drugs that Duterte declared when he took office last year. His government says the police act in self-defense, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability.  We are your ally. We are an important ally,  Duterte told Trump at the beginning of their talks, according to reporters allowed in to the meeting room. Trump replied:  We ve had a great relationship. This has been very successful. And the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) conference has been handled beautifully by the president in the Philippines.  Duterte, who has been called the  Trump of the East  for his brash style and provocative language, said last week he would tell the U.S. president to  lay off  if he were to raise accusations of rights violations. Trump was criticized in May for praising Duterte during a phone call for the  great job  he was doing to counter illegal narcotics. The United States and the Philippines, a former U.S. colony, have been strategic allies since World War Two. But their relations have been strained by anti-U.S. outbursts from Duterte and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China. However, Duterte clearly appears to be getting on better with Trump than he did with the American president s predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump and Duterte seem to have warmed to each other after meeting for the first time on Saturday at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group meeting in Vietnam. On Sunday, Duterte crooned hit Filipino love song  Ikaw  (You) at a gala dinner for summit leaders in Manila, saying it was on  the orders  of Trump. One of the song s verses, translated from Filipino, begins:  You are the light in my world, a half of this heart of mine .  Ladies and gentlemen, I sang uninvited, upon the orders of the commander in chief of the United States,  Duterte said later, according to the ABS-CBN news channel. Roque described the relationship between Trump and Duterte as  warm, friendly and candid.   It s very apparent that both of them have a person who they consider as not a best friend,  he added.   They have similar feelings toward former U.S. President Barack Obama.   Duterte s anger was unleashed last year when Obama raised concern about possible human rights abuses in the war on drugs. Duterte said Obama could  go to hell  and called him a  son of a bitch.  ",

        "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey detained the main opposition leader s lawyer on Friday for alleged links to the network accused of carrying out last year s failed coup, in a widening government crackdown. Lawyer Celal Celik was a former top court judge who resigned from his post in September 2011 in protest of the rising influence of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen s network in the judiciary.  However, Celik had now been detained at his home in the capital Ankara as part of operations targeting the network. Turkey accuses cleric Gulen of orchestrating the abortive putsch in July 2016. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, denies involvement.   What happened today is a disgrace in the name of democracy. The detention decision concerning my lawyer is an eclipse of the mind,  main opposition Republican People s Party (CHP) chairman Kemal Kilicdaroglu was cited as saying by broadcaster CNN Turk. President Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling AK Party have recently adapted a harsher rhetoric against Kilicdaroglu, repeatedly accusing him and the CHP of being linked to Gulen s network and acting together with what it calls the  terrorist organization . Using Erdogan s acronym for the Gulen network, Kilicdaroglu said the government was  supporting the FETO under the banner of a fight against the FETO.       Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters after Friday prayers that Celik s detention was a legal process, and that he hoped  a correct decision  would come from the investigations. CHP Spokesman Bulent Tezcan said the detention was a plot against the party.   Celik had resigned from his judgeship at the court of appeals to battle the FETO when it was at its most powerful. If Calik s home can be raided, then let it be known that every single person faces this threat,  Tezcan said.     More than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial for alleged ties to Gulen s movement and some 150,000 people, including journalists and opposition figures, have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the public and private sectors for the same reason. Rights groups and Turkey s Western allies have expressed concern about the crackdown and suspect the government has used the coup as a pretext to quash dissent. The government says the purges are necessary due to the gravity of the threats it has faced since the failed putsch, in which more than 240 people were killed. ",

Trump Jr. had been invited to testify in public in a hearing in July, but reached an agreement to speak privately with committee staff. \u201cWe look forward to a professional and productive meeting and appreciate the opportunity to assist the committee,\u201d Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for Trump Jr., said in a statement on Wednesday. Russia has loomed large over the first seven months of the Trump presidency. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia worked to tilt last year\u2019s presidential election in favor of Trump, the Republican candidate. Special counsel Robert Mueller is leading an investigation examining potential collusion with Russia by the Trump campaign. Several congressional committees are also looking into the matter, with the Senate and House intelligence committees conducting the main congressional investigations. Trump Jr. is expected to testify before Senate Intelligence sometime later this year. \u201cI\u2019m not interesting in talking to principal witnesses until I\u2019ve talked to everybody else that was in the room,\u201d Senator Richard Burr, the panel\u2019s Republican chairman, told reporters. Congressional investigators have focused on a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower whose attendees included a Russian lawyer and lobbyist and Trump associates including his son, and what came out of it, if anything, in terms of the relationship between Russians and the Trump campaign or Trump business interests.

        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Two-thirds of Mexicans reject offering an amnesty to members of criminal gangs as a way of reducing violence in the country, a poll showed on Monday, days after a top leftist presidential candidate floated the idea of exploring the step. At the start of December, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told supporters in the violence-wracked state of Guerrero he was prepared to analyze all the options, including an amnesty, to bring peace to Mexico after years of violence between gangs.  You can t fight fire with fire,  he said. Asked by a reporter whether his amnesty could include drug cartel bosses, Lopez Obrador his campaign would  consider it  in a recording published by newspaper El Universal. A telephone survey by polling firm Buendia & Laredo for El Universal showed only 23 percent of the respondents agreed somewhat or strongly with the idea of brokering an amnesty with the gangs in exchange for pledges to reduce violence. Some 66 percent took the opposite view, while eight percent said they had no opinion either way. The rest gave no answer. Violence between drug cartels and security forces has been blamed for well over 100,000 deaths in the past decade, and Mexico is on track to register its highest murder total this year since it began keeping regular monthly tallies in 1997. Lopez Obrador, who has led most of the early polls for the July 2018 election, did not provide details about the potential scope of the amnesty, and aides to the 64-year-old consulted by Reuters have so far declined to flesh out how one might work. A former mayor of Mexico City, Lopez Obrador was runner-up in the last two elections, and his adversaries seized on the amnesty to paint the proposal as a threat to security and an affront to the victims of organized crime. A gang truce in El Salvador in 2012 initially cut violence, but when it broke down, murders soared to new heights. The Buendia & Laredo survey, which polled 600 people Dec. 7-8, said that only 16 percent of those polled felt the amnesty would improve the security situation in Mexico, while 62 percent took the opposite view. Some 18 percent believed it would make no difference and the rest gave no answer. The poll was conducted had a margin of error of 4.0 percentage points, El Universal said.     ",

Western countries have called for the release of Kem Sokha and for an end to attempts to dissolve the CNRP. Hun Sen said in a message to CNRP parliamentarians and local councillors, he knew not all had been involved in Kem Sokha s alleged treason and they should take the chance to switch to his ruling Cambodian People s Party (CPP).  I want to give you this opportunity to continue in your job,  he said.  It will not only be that the party is dissolved and then the matter is finished. Maybe more than 100 people will be banned from politics for five years.  He said such a ban was likely to include all the CNRP s steering committee - meaning most of its members of parliament, around half of whom have fled Cambodia to escape arrest. No CNRP officials were immediately available for comment. Cambodia s Supreme Court is in theory independent of the government in ruling on the interior ministry s request for the CNRP to be banned, but Hun Sen has said it is  a fact  that the party will be dissolved. Cambodia s parliament has already passed a law to share out elected positions to other parties if the CNRP is dissolved. Most of the seats in parliament will go to minor parties while local councils, known as communes, will be taken over by the ruling party. ",

        "text": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil s Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles has hired social media experts to boost his image ahead of the 2018 election, three sources told Reuters on Wednesday, the strongest sign yet that the former banker is seriously eyeing a run for president. Meirelles hired analysts linked to the Get lio Vargas Foundation (FGV) think tank to study his social media presence on a daily basis and build a communication plan, said one of the sources. The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.  They have been working for Meirelles for more than three months, two of the sources said. The Finance Ministry s press office declined comment on Meirelles behalf.  The finance minister s potential candidacy adds to political uncertainty ahead of a presidential election marked by a strong anti-establishment climate and a lack of clear favorites.  Meirelles, praised by investors for leading a market-friendly agenda of economic reforms, would have to leave his post by April, six months before the election, and could face a wide field of competitive candidates in a first-round vote. One of the analysts hired by Meirelles works alongside the ministry s official communication team in Brasilia, although the FGV team has not received any public funds for supporting his potential candidacy, two of the sources said.  The team includes Thomas Traumann, a former spokesman for impeached President Dilma Rousseff, according one of the sources and another person familiar with the matter. Traumann confirmed to Reuters that he had consulted for Meirelles under private contract since 2015, but he did not work for the Finance Ministry. He declined to comment on potential preparations for next year s presidential race. The Finance Ministry said FGV has offered consultancy on social media to the ministry as part of a 40-year-long initiative of institutional support, without any connection to the 2018 campaign. A  ministry spokeswoman, who asked not to be named in accordance with ministry policy, said it had no relationship with Traumann. FGV said it had not signed a contract with the Finance Ministry or Meirelles. Reuters reported late in August, citing a source close to Meirelles, that Meirelles wanted to run for president but knew he would have a strong chance only if the economy improved substantially after two years of recession.  Congressmen from his Social Democratic Party (PSD) last month heard from Meirelles that he felt honored to have his name floated as a potential candidate. Other potential candidates from within President Michel Temer s fragmented coalition include the governor of Sao Paulo state, Geraldo Alckmin, and Sao Paulo Mayor Joao Doria. Meirelles opened a Twitter account in June to publicize his actions as minister and has recently left the door open for a potential candidacy, saying he would take a decision on the race by April. About 2 percent of voters have declared their intention to vote for him, according to a recent Datafolha poll.  A civil engineer by training, Meirelles is the former president of BankBoston, which was eventually acquired by Bank of America Corp, and a former president of Brazil s central bank. ",

        "title": "Republicans offer bill to block potential Iran dollar use",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Republican U.S. senators who oppose the nuclear agreement with Iran introduced a bill on Wednesday that would keep Iran from gaining even indirect access to the U.S. financial system or using U.S. dollars in business transactions. The measure introduced by Senators Mark Kirk and Marco Rubio came amid media reports that U.S. officials were moving toward allowing such transactions. President Barack Obama has denied having such plans. The legislation would prohibit the president from issuing any license for conducting an offshore U.S. dollar clearing system for Iranian transactions or providing any such system with U.S. dollars. It also would impose secondary sanctions on any financial institution found to be participating in any offshore dollar clearing system with Iran. State Department spokesman Mark Toner acknowledged the United States was advising banks and other businesses about how to conduct business with Tehran without running afoul of U.S. authorities, but that does not involve converting money to dollars. \u201cThese banks don\u2019t want to violate existing sanctions,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they are allowed to under certain condition to do business with Iran, so we do consider it as an obligation on how to counsel them.\u201d Along with some of Obama\u2019s fellow Democrats, congressional Republicans unanimously opposed the deal announced in July in which Iran agreed to scale back its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Several lawmakers have been working on legislation since to keep tight controls on Iran, especially over its repeated ballistic missile tests since late last year. U.S. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, published a column in the Washington Post on Wednesday saying Obama was so eager to preserve a signature foreign policy agreement that he would consider measures that would let Iran \u201claunder dollars while the administration looked the other way.\u201d The issue is particularly potent in this U.S. election year, when Americans will pick a new president, and every member of the House and one-third of senators are up for re-election. The three remaining Republican presidential candidates have all vowed to tear up or back away from the nuclear deal, which Obama administration officials say would be calamitous. Rubio suspended his 2016 presidential campaign last month, and Kirk\u2019s Senate re-election race is seen as one of this year\u2019s most competitive. ",

        "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey cautioned its citizens on Saturday to take care when traveling to Germany, citing what it said was an upswing in anti-Turkish sentiment ahead of a German national election later this month. The advisory is likely to further exacerbate tensions between the two NATO allies, whose ties have soured following last year s failed coup against Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and his subsequent crackdown on alleged coup supporters.  The political leadership campaigns in Germany are based on anti-Turkey sentiment and preventing our country s EU membership. The political atmosphere... has actually been under the effects of far-right and even racist rhetoric for some time,  Turkey s foreign mininstry said in a statement. Last weekend German Chancellor Angela Merkel said during a televised election debate that she would seek an end to Turkey s membership talks with the European Union, in an apparent shift of her position that infuriated Ankara.  Merkel, whose conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) have long been skeptical about Turkey s EU ambitions, is expected to win a fourth term in office in Germany s Sept. 24 election.  Turkish citizens who live in, or who plan to travel to, Germany should be cautious and act prudently in cases of possible incidents, behavior or verbal assaults of xenophobia and racism,  the foreign ministry said. The advisory marks a reversal of roles. Earlier this year Germany warned its own citizens traveling to Turkey about increased tensions and protests ahead of a Turkish referendum on April 16 which considerably expanded Erdogan s powers. Merkel and other EU leaders have strongly criticized Erdogan s actions since the failed coup, saying his purges of Turkey s state institutions and armed forces amount to a deliberate attempt to stifle criticism. More than 50,000 people have been detained and 150,000  suspended in the crackdown, including journalists and opposition figures. Some German nationals have also been targeted. Turkey says the purges are necessary given the extent of the security threat it faces. ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the crucial last weeks\u00a0of the U.S. presidential campaign, Democrat Hillary Clinton has dramatically widened her advantage over Republican rival Donald Trump in ad spending, according to\u00a0campaign finance reports released\u00a0on\u00a0Thursday. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The newest filings showed Clinton\u2019s\u00a0campaign and Super PAC outspending Trump in the first three weeks of October by a factor of\u00a0two to one on everything from national TV ads to local outreach on smartphone screens. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, the two Super PACs associated with Trump\u2019s White House bid have seen their fundraising start to stall out, with one of the groups reserving no broadcast or cable ads between Oct. 20 and Election Day, according to data from ad-tracking firm SMG Delta. Clinton and Priorities USA, the Super PAC that supports her, have spent $360 million on all types of advertising since the beginning of the campaign,\u00a0said\u00a0the new reports, which covered spending through Oct. 19. That total\u00a0blows away the $147\u00a0million spent on advertising by Trump and his two affiliated Super PACs during the same period. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What\u2019s more, for\u00a0the period beginning Oct. 20 and running through\u00a0the Nov. 8\u00a0election, Clinton and her Super PAC have reserved an additional $55 million in TV ads, according to SMG Delta, including $30.5 million from her campaign and $25 million from her Super PAC. A Super PAC is a fund-raising group that must operate separately from political campaigns but can raise unlimited sums. The Trump campaign has committed to spending $32.4 million during the same period, with the Trump Super PAC known as Great America PAC saying it would also contribute another $2.35 million in broadcast and cable ads. The newest batch of campaign finance filings also reveal that the celebrity businessman\u2019s recent vow that he would contribute in excess of $100 million to his campaign out of his own fortune has also fallen short.  \u00a0 \u00a0 Trump contributed $56 million through the end of September, chipping in an additional $31,000 since then.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spending on television commercials does\u00a0not\u00a0decide an election. Trump, with his\u00a0controversial\u00a0statements and inflammatory tweets, has mastered the art of garnering free media coverage, which is expected to top $5 billion by Election  Day, more than double the amount Clinton is likely to earn, according to data analytics tracker mediaQuant. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But\u00a0ever since Trump\u2019s campaign began to falter last summer after he criticized the family of a slain U.S. soldier, Clinton has been able to use her ad spending juggernaut to repetitively pound at criticisms of Trump, which several strategists said had exacerbated his slide in polls, where he now lags Clinton by eight percentage points. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trump could pour more money into his ad operation in the final 11 days of the campaign. Republican presidential campaign operatives said areas where Trump could still spend included battleground states, national ad buys and digital outreach and phone banking.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But they also said it may be too late for such outlays to make a difference.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe stations would gladly take his money,\u201d said Fred Davis, a\u00a0major Republican ad maker. \u201cI just don\u2019t think he will.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the Republican nominating contests, Trump vanquished 16 opponents in part by eschewing campaign finance mainstays such as ads and pollsters.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe felt he won the primary with basically no ad spending by being a larger-than-life TV personality. It worked,\u201d\u00a0Davis said. But the general election, he added, was \u201ca whole new ballgame.\u201d Many of Clinton\u2019s TV ads have focused on upbeat messages featuring her work on behalf of women and children. She\u2019s also spent a large amount of her advertising budget attacking Trump, including a commercial that showed children listening to some of his most demeaning remarks about women. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trump\u2019s ads, by contrast, paint a dark picture of America, besieged by violence and on the brink of economic destruction. \u00a0 \u00a0 Rick Wilson, a former strategist for Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign, said \u201cads don\u2019t matter, until they do,\u201d adding that comments by Trump that critics have called racist and sexist were providing maximum ammunition for Clinton. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trump may not be able to rely on his small cadre of big donors, either: Make America Number 1 PAC \u2013 a super PAC formed by conservative mega-donor Robert Mercer - raised nothing between Oct. 1 and 19.  At the same time, Trump has also stopped doing high-dollar fundraisers. Overall, the reports released on Thursday night showed how much Trump and his lean campaign operation have been dwarfed by Clinton\u2019s big money juggernaut. In total, Trump has raised $292 million between his campaign and affiliated Super PACs, including his own contributions, whereas Clinton has hauled in more than twice that, at $718 million.  ",

Now mayor of Tallahassee, Florida, and viewed as a rising star in that state, Gillum did not hesitate when asked to name his political role model.  \u201cElizabeth Warren,\u201d he replied, referring to the firebrand U.S. senator from Massachusetts.  That the 37-year-old African-American mayor of a Southern U.S. city identifies Warren as his political lodestar speaks volumes about the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive shift, even as Hillary Clinton officially became its presidential nominee after a quarter-century in the public eye. With the party in transition, Clinton\u2019s 1990s-era brand of Democratic centrism is slowly being eclipsed by a wave of progressivism personified by Warren and by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a rival of Clinton\u2019s until he endorsed her this month. Although Sanders\u2019 insurgent presidential bid fell short, leaving his supporters bitterly disappointed, a new crop of Democratic candidates seems determined to carry on his work, with Warren, 67, as their putative leader.  Like Obama in 2004, Gillum and many others at the Philadelphia convention sought to boost their profiles, raise cash and network with fellow Democrats, buoyed by the adoption of the most progressive platform in party history, with planks for debt-free college, expanded Social Security benefits and a tax on carbon emissions. Clinton, too, has moved to the left, embracing many of these causes, separating herself from a more moderate brand of Democratic politics personified by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who was pro-free trade, friendlier to Wall Street and emphasized budget discipline.  She appealed to Sanders supporters during her speech accepting the party\u2019s presidential nomination on Thursday, pledging to work with him on progressive issues. \u201cLet\u2019s go out there and make it happen together,\u201d Clinton said.  Sarah Lloyd, 44, a congressional candidate in Wisconsin who supported Sanders, said, \u201cThere is an energy that\u2019s coming from the folks that were brought to the process by the Sanders campaign.... That can only be a positive thing for the party.\u201d More than Sanders, Warren has taken the lead in shaping the Democrats\u2019 next generation. Formerly a professor of law, Warren conceived and set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau formed in 2011 under President Obama. She launched a political action committee to back Democratic candidates and inspired other advocacy groups, such as the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, to solicit donations to a bloc it terms the party\u2019s \u201cWarren wing.\u201d A speaker at the convention, Florida\u2019s Gillum was frustrated by Sanders because he seemed disinterested in helping other Democratic candidates, in contrast with Warren.  \u201cSenator Sanders was content to be a movement by himself,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cIt\u2019s a revolution when you bring people along with you.\u201d  Warren\u2019s committee has donated to the campaigns of U.S. Senate hopefuls such as Kamala Harris, 51, of California, Jason Kander, 35, of Missouri, and Catherine Cortez Masto, 52, of Nevada. They and Wisconsin\u2019s Lloyd oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the global trade deal that has split the progressive and moderate elements of the party. The PCCC\u2019s slate of \u201cWarren wing\u201d candidates supports a $15-an-hour minimum wage, campaign-finance reform and tighter rules for Wall Street.  One of those on the slate is Zephyr Teachout, a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in New York, who has campaigned in a T-shirt that reads, \u201cI\u2019m from the Elizabeth Warren wing of the party\u201d and who has been endorsed by Sanders.  \u201cThere is a rising and very important populism, talking about money in politics, talking about trade, talking about economic issues,\u201d Teachout, 44, told Reuters. \u201cWithin the party, and across the board, there has been a serious rethinking of trade, rethinking of big banks, rethinking of monopolies that have too much power.\u201d Tulsi Gabbard, a U.S. representative from Hawaii, is often mentioned by Sanders supporters as one who could assume his mantle. A cable-news regular, Gabbard, 35, was one of a few Sanders supporters offered a convention speaking slot. Onstage she formally nominated Sanders for president, saying he had become a \u201cvoice for millions, connecting seamlessly with laborers in the Rust Belt and environmentalists in the West.\u201d Other rising Democratic progressives frequently cited by strategists include Julian Castro, 41, the U.S. housing secretary, and his twin brother, Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, former Ohio state senator Nina Turner, 48, U.S. Senate candidate Pramila Jayapal, 50, of Washington, and former South Carolina lawmaker Bakari Sellers, 31. Harris might be the one to shine the brightest. As California\u2019s attorney general, Harris has been mentioned as a potential U.S. presidential candidate or U.S. Supreme Court justice should she win her Senate race in November. She enjoys the support of Warren, Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, a Republican-turned-independent, suggesting she can appeal to both the party\u2019s liberal and moderate flanks.  She joined forces with Bloomberg in his crusade for tighter gun laws, bonded with Warren over helping homeowners struggling through the foreclosure crisis of the late 2000s and joined Obama\u2019s efforts to overhaul a criminal justice system that tends to treat black citizens more harshly than white ones. In one campaign ad, Warren is viewed saying, \u201cKamala Harris was fearless.\u201d Harris, in turn, has backed Clinton. In an interview, she rejected the idea that the party is leaving Clinton behind even as it nominates her for president.  \u201cI strongly believe that these two generations have much more in common than what separates them in terms of fundamental values,\u201d Harris said.

        "title": "EU urges swifter Brexit talks as London seeks 'flexibility'",
        "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Monday he was concerned at the slow progress of Brexit talks, while his British counterpart David Davis called for  imagination and flexibility  to move on.  British officials arrived in Brussels on Monday hoping to push the EU toward talks about their post-Brexit ties, which the bloc refuses to launch until there is agreement on London s exit bill and other pressing  divorce  matters, including the rights of EU citizens in Britain after March 2019.  To be honest, I am concerned. Time passes quickly,  Barnier told reporters as he welcomed Davis back for a new round of talks. The third formal session since the process began in June, it is due to wind up on Thursday.  We must start negotiating seriously,  Barnier said.  The sooner we remove the ambiguity, the sooner we will be in a position to discuss the future relationship.  He welcomed a series of proposals London made over the summer break, but made clear they fell short of what EU leaders want to see before they will agree to open negotiations on the future free trade agreement the British government wants. Impatient with the structure of talks agreed among the 27 other states and now binding Barnier s negotiators, the British position papers made frequent reference to a future relationship with the EU rather than just the immediate task of bringing legal clarity for people and business when Britain leaves.  The UK government has published a large number of papers covering important issues related to our withdrawal and our vision for a deep and special partnership,  Davis said.  We want to lock in the points where we agree, unpick the areas where we disagree and make further progress on the whole range of issues,  he added. To do that would require  flexibility and imagination from both sides , he said. But the EU wants to settle the major separation issues of ensuring expatriate rights, agreeing a divorce bill and squaring the circle of the future Irish border before jumping into talks about post-Brexit ties with London.  The EU 27 and the European Parliament are united. They will not accept that separation issues are not addressed properly,  Barnier said.  I am ready to intensify negotiations over the coming weeks in order to advance.  British officials took a relaxed view of Barnier s implied criticisms, noting it was a familiar line from the former French minister, and dismissed a suggestion talks were going badly. The EU has already signaled that the slow progress so far has made talks about a new accord with Britain less likely to start after an EU summit in October, as had been hoped. The EU and Britain seem far apart on agreeing how much London should pay the bloc on departure to account for previous commitments.  The Irish issue is extremely delicate because of the history of political violence there, as well as the complex economic consequences of Brexit.  Dublin said on Monday much of the future border arrangements between Northern Ireland and Ireland could be solved before Brexit talks enter the next phase. Neither side expects major breakthroughs this week in talks aimed at unraveling more than 40 years of union. Neither seems ready for major political concessions at this stage. An EU official said it was  clearly worrying that we have major differences of core issues ... with very little time to land all this, even if Britain moves . Britain s opposition Labour Party on Sunday offered an alternative to the policy pursued by Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May by saying it would stay in the European single market for a transitional period after Brexit. The British and German chambers of commerce together urged negotiators on Monday to start talks about future trading relations, and particularly customs arrangements, swiftly. Writing in Le Monde in his native France, Barnier said the EU and Britain must remain allies for their common defense:  The Union of 27 and the United Kingdom will have to join forces to stand up to common threats,  he said.   The security of our citizens cannot be haggled over.  ",

        "text": "(Reuters) - Richard Cordray, a Democrat whose resignation as head of the U.S. consumer bureau last month triggered a political battle over who should replace him, plans to run for governor of Ohio, an advisor said on Monday. Cordray will make the announcement at an event on Tuesday at a restaurant in his home town of Grove City, Ohio, said the advisor, who asked to remain anonymous. Cordray will later tour Ohio, meeting with Democratic activists, community leaders and voters, the advisor said. When he resigned last month, Cordray named his deputy to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But the appointment was mired in turmoil after President Donald Trump assigned White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney to the role. A federal judge last week sided with Trump, but the deputy, Leandra English, is challenging the decision. The 2018 election is to replace Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Republican who cannot seek a third term because of term limits in the pivotal election battleground state. Kasich ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016. Many Democrats have said Cordray, with his reputation for being tough on banks and defending consumers, is their best hope for taking the Ohio governor\u2019s mansion and chipping away at Republicans\u2019 dominance in state government. Several candidates from both the Republican and Democratic parties announced they would run for Ohio governor, according to local media. Cordray delivered a campaign-style speech at a Labor Day celebration in Cincinnnati in September, but at the time he stopped short of saying whether he intended to run for governor. The Ohio native was the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a consumer watchdog agency created under former President Barack Obama in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  In Washington, Mulvaney on Monday said he has no intention of firing English. ",

        "text": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations  political affairs chief will visit North Korea this week, making the highest-level visit by a U.N. official in more than six years as tensions grip the region over Pyongyang s nuclear and weapons programs. Jeffrey Feltman, a former senior official of the U.S. State Department, will visit from Tuesday to Friday and meet with officials to discuss  issues of mutual interest and concern,  the United Nations said. He will meet with North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho and Vice Minister Pak Myong Guk, said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric, adding that the visit was in response to  a long-standing invitation from the authorities in Pyongyang for a policy dialogue with the U.N.   He will also meet with the United Nations Country Team and members of the diplomatic corps, as well as visit U.N. project sites,  Dujarric told reporters, adding that Feltman was also visiting China. Feltman will be the first senior U.N. official to travel to North Korea since his predecessor Lynn Pascoe visited in February 2010 and former U.N. aid chief Valerie Amos visited in October 2011, the United Nations said. The visit comes at a time of high tension over North Korea s program to develop nuclear tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States, including the test of Pyongyang s largest intercontinental ballistic missile last week. An official of the U.S. State Department said it was  aware  of the planned trip, when asked in Washington backed the initiative.  The United States will continue to work with other countries, including the members of the U.N. Security Council, to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on (North Korea) to convince the regime to abandon its illegal nuclear weapons and missile development programs,  the official added.  It is imperative that the countries of the world present North Korea with a unified, unambiguous response to its unlawful provocations.  The official said the U.S. focus remained on finding a peaceful diplomatic solution to the crisis, but  the reality is that the regime has shown no interest in credible negotiations.  While stressing that it favors a diplomatic solution, President Donald Trump s administration has said it will never accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state and has warned that all options, including military ones, are on the table. On Monday, the United States and South Korea went ahead with large-scale joint aerial drills, a move North Korea had said would push the Korean peninsula to  the brink of nuclear war.   Russia and China wanted the drills called off.  North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its missile and nuclear programs. At a U.N. Security Council meeting last week to discuss the missile test, U.N. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said that while Washington does not seek war with Pyongyang,  if war comes, make no mistake, the North Korean regime will be utterly destroyed.  Dujarric said North Korea issued the invitation for Feltman to visit on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations in New York in September, but the visit was confirmed only late last week.     When asked if Feltman was paving the way for a visit by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Dujarric said:  We hope to have more afterwards.  There are about 50 international staff working for six U.N. agencies in North Korea - the U.N. Development Programme, the U.N. children s agency UNICEF, the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the U.N. Population Fund. ",

        "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army and its allies took complete control over Albu Kamal, Islamic State s last significant town in Syria, a military news service run by Hezbollah said on Sunday.  The army had declared victory over Islamic State in Albu Kamal earlier this month but the jihadists then staged a counter-attack using sleeper cells hidden in the town.  Driving Islamic State from Albu Kamal means only a few villages along the Euphrates and patches of nearby desert, as well as isolated pockets in other parts of the country, remain in Syria of the caliphate it declared in 2014.  Most of the forces battling Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have said they expect it to go underground and turn to a guerrilla insurgency using sleeper cells and bombings.  Western intelligence agencies have said it will still be able to inspire attacks on civilians around the world.   The Syrian Army and its allies in the axis of resistance have expelled Daesh from its last stronghold on Syrian soil,  the Hezbollah news service reported.  The  axis of resistance  is used by those in it to describe the alliance of Iran, Syria and Shi ite militias including Hezbollah.  The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday that most IS members withdrew from the town, with fighting continuing in the perimeter of Albu Kamal. Islamic State s area of rule in Syria has crumbled this year under two rival military campaigns.  The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, backed by a U.S.-led coalition has driven it from much of its territory in the north, including its former Syrian capital Raqqa. Syria s army and its allies have waged an offensive across central and eastern Syria backed by Russian air and missile power.  The two offensives have mostly avoided conflict with each other through communication between the United States and Russia. However, Syrian and Iranian officials have said that Damascus seeks to regain control over areas held by the SDF. ",

        "text": "UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has called on the U.N. Security Council to  blacklist 10 ships for circumventing sanctions on North Korea, documents showed on Tuesday, while South Korea s President suggested delaying military exercises with Washington to ease tensions ahead of next year s Winter Olympics. Documents seen by Reuters said the 10 vessels had been conducting ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum products to North Korean vessels or transporting North Korean coal in violation of U.N. sanctions imposed over Pyongyang s nuclear and missile programs. The ships would be blacklisted - meaning countries would be required to ban them from entering their ports - if none of the 15 members of the Security Council s North Korea sanctions committee object by Thursday afternoon. North Korea is under a U.N. arms embargo and the Security Council has banned trade in exports such as coal, textiles, seafood, iron and other minerals to choke funding for Pyongyang s missile and nuclear programs.  In September, the council put a cap of 2 million barrels a year on refined petroleum products exports to North Korea. The ships targeted for blacklisting were Xin Sheng Hai (flag unknown); the Hong-Kong-flagged Lighthouse Winmore; the Togo-flagged Yu Yuan; Panama-flagged Glory Hope 1 (also known as Orient Shenyu), Kai Xiang, and Billions No. 18; and the North Korean-flagged Ul Ji Bong 6, Rung Ra 2, Rye Song Gang 1, and Sam Jong 2. Four ships were designated for carrying coal from North Korea by the council s North Korea sanctions committee in October. The United States has led a drive to step up sanctions on North Korea in response to Pyongyang s efforts to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States. In Ottawa on Tuesday, Canada and the United States said they would co-host a foreign ministers meeting in Vancouver on Jan. 16 to demonstrate international solidarity against North Korea s nuclear and missile tests. Representatives of the countries that sent troops or other military support to the U.N.-backed effort to repel North Korean forces after the 1950 invasion of South Korea will attend. Japan, India and Sweden will also attend, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said.  We can t talk unless North Korea is ready to talk,  Tillerson told reporters after meeting with Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland.  What s important for North Korea to know is that this pressure campaign will not abate, we will not be rolling any of it back, it will only be intensified as time goes by, and it will remain in place until they agree to give up their nuclear weapons and allow us to verify the fact that is what they have done,  he said. Freeland said the world had to demonstrate to North Korea that it was united in condemning Pyongyang s actions.  The international pressure campaign - we believe it s going to be successful, and a successful outcome of the international pressure campaign is a diplomatic engagement,  Freeland said. Washington has warned that all options are on the table, including military ones, to prevent North Korea s missile development. On Friday, Tillerson had urged North Korea to carry out a  sustained cessation  of weapons testing to allow the two countries to hold talks. North Korea paused its missile testing for more than two months before firing a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile in late November. U.S. officials say it has given no indication it is willing to discuss giving up its nuclear program and Pyongyang has repeatedly denounced U.S. and South Korean military drills, which it says are a prelude to invasion. On Tuesday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he was willing to ease tensions ahead of next year s Winter Olympics in South Korea by delaying joint military exercises.  It is possible for South Korea and the U.S. to review the possibility of postponing the exercises,  he told NBC News.   I ve made such a suggestion to the U.S., and the U.S. is currently reviewing it. However, all this depends on how North Korea behaves.  A spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command, Commander Dave Benham, declined to discuss any plans for exercises. Earlier on Tuesday, Japan and South Korea, both U.S. allies, urged China to put more pressure on North Korea. Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said after talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha that China - North Korea s neighbor and only big ally - was implementing Security Council resolutions but could do more. China routinely says it is meeting its U.N. obligations on North Korea and has urged  all sides  to pursue dialogue. The U.S. Navy s top officer, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson, said on Tuesday that vessels from the eastern Pacific could be moved to reinforce U.S. naval power in Asia as Washington contends with increased threats in the region and accidents that have weakened its maritime force. China has been irritated by stepped-up U.S. naval deployments in the Pacific and along with Russia has proposed that Washington and Seoul halt major military exercises in exchange for North Korea freezing its weapons programs. Washington has warned North Korea it would be  totally destroyed  in the event of war and on Monday U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a new national security strategy stressing the need to deal with the challenge posed by Pyongyang. This week Washington publicly blamed North Korea for a massive worldwide cyber attack in May that crippled hospitals, banks and other companies. A White House official said on Tuesday that Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp disabled a number of North Korean cyber threats last week. Researchers say a series of cyber attacks has netted North Korean hackers millions of dollars in virtual currencies like bitcoin, with more attacks expected, as international sanctions drive the country to seek new sources of cash.

Major medical and insurance groups penned a letter to Trump on Wednesday urging him to maintain funding for the subsidies, which amount to about $7 billion a year and are paid directly to insurers. They help cover premiums, deductibles and other medical expenses for about 7 million people who purchase health insurance on the individual health insurance market. House of Representatives Republicans sued the Obama administration for funding the subsidies, which they argue have to be appropriated by Congress. A federal judge in May 2016 ruled in favor of the Republicans, prompting an appeal by the Obama administration. The case is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Major insurers, including Humana Inc and Aetna, have left or announced their intention to leave the Obamacare exchanges, citing multi-million-dollar losses and patient populations that are far costlier and sicker than they expected. They warned that withholding the subsidies would destabilize the market further and leave millions of consumers with little or no choice in picking a health insurance plan. ",

        "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Friday it had lodged a complaint with Australia after its prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said he took reports very seriously that China s Communist Party had sought to interfere in his country. Turnbull said this week that foreign powers were making  unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process  in Australia and the world. He cited  disturbing reports about Chinese influence . Turnbull, speaking to parliament on Thursday during the introduction of legislation to stop external interference in domestic politics, reiterated those concerns.  Media reports have suggested that the Chinese Communist Party has been working to covertly interfere with our media, our universities and even the decisions of elected representatives right here in this building. We take these reports very seriously,  he said. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in Beijing he was  shocked  at what Turnbull had said. Such comments pandered to certain irresponsible reports in Australian media, were full of prejudice against China, were baseless and poisoned the atmosphere of China-Australia relations, Geng told a daily news briefing.  We express strong dissatisfaction at this, and have already lodged solemn representations with the Australian side,  he said. Geng said China had always respected the principle of non-interference in internal affairs in dealing with Australia  We strongly urge the relevant Australian person to spurn Cold War thinking and prejudice towards China, immediately stop making wrong comments that harm political mutual trust and mutually beneficial cooperation, and take effective steps to dispel negative effects,  he added. Geng s remarks were China s latest and strongest broadside against Australia on the issue. The Chinese embassy in Australia on Wednesday accused Australia of hysteria and paranoia after Turnbull vowed to ban foreign political donations to curb external influence in domestic politics. China s soft power has come under renewed focus this week after a politician from Australia s opposition Labor party was demoted from government having been found to have warned a prominent Chinese business leader and Communist Party member that his phone was being tapped by intelligence authorities. In June, Fairfax Media and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported on a concerted campaign by China to  infiltrate  Australian politics to promote Chinese interests.  ",

        "title": "State funding changes in spotlight in Republican healthcare bill",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican leaders sought to nail down the final votes needed to pass what U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday called their \u201clast best chance\u201d to repeal Obamacare while a new analysis underscored how Democratic-leaning states stand to lose large amounts of federal funding under the legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to bring the bill introduced by fellow Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy to a vote next week, as his party seeks to make good on seven years of promises to erase Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement. With no Democratic support for the bill, Republicans remain a handful of votes short in the Senate, needing 50 votes in a 100-seat chamber they control 52-48, with Pence casting a potential tie-breaking vote. Senator Rand Paul opposes it and at least six others are undecided: John McCain, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan, Rob Portman and Jerry Moran. Asked whether the legislation will pass, Pence said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see. We\u2019re close.\u201d Republicans, still reeling from their failure in July to win Senate passage of previous legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, have set a Sept. 30 deadline for passage of this bill. \u201cThis may well be our last best chance to stop and turn around and head America back in the direction of the kind of healthcare reform that\u2019s based on individual-choice, state-based innovations,\u201d Pence told Fox New Channel. President Donald Trump has been pushing Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, which would fulfill one of his top campaign promises from last year. The current bill would take money that the federal government now spends on healthcare through the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and subsidies to help Americans buy private insurance and distribute it to the states in block grants. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has not yet assessed the bill\u2019s effects but independent analyses indicate it would fundamentally redistribute federal healthcare money, generally with Republican-leaning states benefiting and Democratic-leaning states losing. The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare research group, estimated on Thursday that states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare would lose $180 billion under the bill from 2020 to 2026, while non-expansion states would gain $73 billion in the same time period. The Graham-Cassidy bill in 2020 would end the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, which many Democratic-governed states had carried out while many Republican-governed states did not, and limit overall federal spending on the five-decade-old program regardless of how many Americans qualify for its benefits. Republicans have called Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, a federal overreach, and say block grants would give states discretion on how to provide healthcare coverage. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, five states would stand to lose more than 30 percent of their federal healthcare money from 2020-2026: New York (down 35 percent), Oregon (down 32 percent), Connecticut (down 31 percent), Vermont (down 31 percent) and Minnesota (down 30 percent). All are Democratic leaning. The analysis found that six Republican-leaning states would get at least 40 percent more in federal funds: Mississippi (up 148 percent), Texas (up 75 percent), Kansas (up 61 percent), Georgia (up 46 percent), South Dakota (up 45 percent) and Tennessee (up 44 percent). In total dollars, the state with the largest forecast loss of funds is California, losing $56 billion. The biggest gainer would be Texas, with a $34 billion increase. California, the most populous U.S. state, is Democratic leaning. Texas is the second most populous state and the largest Republican-leaning one. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely true to say the Graham-Cassidy bill over time levels out on a per-person basis the way we distribute money on healthcare, which I think resonates with most Americans,\u201d Pence said. McCain, Collins and Murkowski were the three Republicans who voted against the last Republican healthcare legislation brought up in the Senate, which failed 51-49 in July. Paul, who voted in favor of that bill after previously expressing misgivings, on Thursday went to Twitter to underscore his criticism that the Graham-Cassidy bill does not go far enough to erase Obamacare. The insurance industry, hospitals, medical advocacy groups such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and American Cancer Society, the AARP advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists have come out against the bill, urging a bipartisan fix to the current law that was abandoned this week. More medical and civil rights advocacy groups lined up against the Graham-Cassidy bill on Thursday, including the American Psychological Association, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the NAACP.  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, estimated that the bill would cause more than 30 million people to lose insurance. The Graham-Cassidy proposal would let states opt out of the requirement that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates, causing a furor among advocacy groups that say it could make health insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions.

        "title": "U.S. makes lower trade deficit top priority in NAFTA talks",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday launched the first salvo in the renegotiation of the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), saying its top priority for the talks was shrinking the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico. In a much-anticipated document sent to lawmakers, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he would seek to reduce the trade imbalance by improving access for U.S. goods exported to Canada and Mexico under the three-nation pact.  For the first time in a U.S. trade deal, the administration also said it wants an \u201cappropriate\u201d provision to deter currency manipulation by trading partners. The move appeared aimed at future trade deals rather than specifically at Canada and Mexico, which are not considered currency manipulators. The 17-page document asserted that no country should manipulate its currency exchange rate to gain an unfair competitive advantage, an often-cited complaint about China in past years. Shortly before the release of the document, President Donald Trump lashed out against trade deals and unfair trade practices, saying he would take more legal and regulatory steps during the next six months to protect American manufacturers.  Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland said the U.S. list was \u201cpart of its internal process\u201d although a source familiar with the Canadian government\u2019s thinking said the document was \u201cnot earth shattering.\u201d The source said officials from the United States, Mexico and Canada would meet in Washington on Tuesday to discuss logistics of the talks. No date has been announced for the NAFTA talks, but they are expected in mid-August. Mexico\u2019s economy ministry said in a statement it would work \u201cto achieve a constructive negotiation process that will allow trade and investment flows to increase and consolidates cooperation and economic integration to strengthen North American competitiveness.\u201d Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior Mexican government official said the list of priorities was \u201cnot as bad as I was expecting\u201d and welcomed that the United States was not pushing to impose punitive tariffs, as Trump has threatened. Trade experts have argued that shrinking the yawning U.S. trade deficit will not be achieved through trade deals but rather by boosting U.S. savings.  \u201cThe first bullet point shows their preoccupation with bilateral trade deficits and that\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d said Chad Bown, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThere\u2019s not much that trade policy and trade agreements can do to change those. That\u2019s more of a macroeconomic issue.\u201d Among the priorities, Lighthizer said the administration would seek to eliminate a trade dispute mechanism that has largely prohibited the United States from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Canadian and Mexican firms. There was no mention of active disputes between the United States and Canada over softwood lumber and dairy products, but the document targeted a range of agricultural non-tariff barriers, including subsidies and unfair pricing structures, that are currently at the heart of those standoffs. USTR said it would seek to strengthen NAFTA\u2019s rules of origin to ensure that the pact\u2019s benefits do not go to outside countries and to \u201cincentivize\u201d the sourcing of U.S. goods. It offered no details on such incentives and did not specify how much of a product\u2019s components must originate from NAFTA countries. Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a group representing U.S. automakers, welcomed the decision to include objectives on the removal of regulatory barriers and the provision on currency manipulation. A spokesman for Ford Motor Co said: \u201cForeign currency manipulation is the 21st century trade barrier, and we strongly support the inclusion of this top-tier issue in the U.S. negotiating objectives for NAFTA.\u201d The document also outlined plans to upgrade standards for labor and the environment and govern digital trade. Canada and Mexico have already agreed to upgrade these areas as part of the defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Earlier on Monday, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said NAFTA had been an \u201cunequivocal failure\u201d and should be completely renegotiated although he stopped short of calling on Trump to abandon the agreement if there was no agreement. \u201cWe will do everything we can to make this a good agreement and to hold the president at his word and make sure we get a renegotiation,\u201d the head of the 12.5-million-strong union umbrella group told a conference call with reporters.  \u201cIf it comes out that it is not a good deal, no deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d Trumka said. NAFTA has quadrupled trade among the three countries, surpassing $1 trillion in 2015, but the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico exceeded $63 billion last year. ",

        "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon has set a date of May 6 next year to hold its first legislative election in nearly a decade, potentially transforming the politics of a country caught in a confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk signed a decree setting the date on Friday, allowing the vote to go ahead at last. The election has been postponed three times since the last vote in 2009, with politicians citing security concerns, political crisis and a dispute over the election law. Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri s coalition government, which took office a year ago, agreed on the new election law in June, but setting the date was held up while officials debated technical details and registered Lebanese citizens abroad. Lebanon s political landscape has shifted dramatically since the last election. Hariri s pro-Western, Saudi-backed political alliance has split up. For the past year he has led a power-sharing government which includes the heavily armed, Iran-backed Shi ite movement Hezbollah, despised by his Saudi allies. Hariri sparked a political crisis last month by announcing his resignation while in Riyadh and denouncing Hezbollah and Iran. He stayed abroad for two weeks before returning, and finally withdrew his resignation last week. Lebanon has a complex electoral system designed to maintain civil peace in a country where Sunnis, Shi ites, Christians and Druze fought numerous civil wars since independence in 1943. The 128-seat parliament includes 64 Christians apportioned among seven denominations, and 64 Muslims, including equal numbers of Sunnis and Shi ites. The country is divided into districts that each vote for multiple lawmakers according to strict religious quotas. The president must be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the parliament speaker a Shi ite Muslim, representing the three biggest groups in parliament. The international community has repeatedly stressed the importance of Lebanon holding timely elections to restore confidence in its institutions and maintain stability.

        "text": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - The new governor of Indonesia s capital faced a barrage of criticism on Tuesday for remarks in his inauguration speech that some residents and politicians warned could stoke ethnic and religious tension in the Southeast Asian country. Anies Baswedan, a former education minister, said in a speech only hours after he was sworn in on Monday that  pribumi  (native or indigenous Indonesians) should take back control of the country from  colonial  influences.  His comments came as tolerance in the Muslim-majority country has been under scrutiny since bitterly fought city elections this year during which Islamist-led rallies targeted the former governor, an ethnic Chinese Christian, in a controversial blasphemy case.   We  pribumi  people were oppressed and defeated. Now, after independence, it is time for us to be masters in our own country,  Baswedan said in a speech to supporters outside the Jakarta City Hall late on Monday.     The word  pribumi , which excludes ethnic groups like Chinese Indonesians or Indian Indonesians who have lived in the country for generations, was the top trending topic on Twitter in Indonesia on Tuesday.  You are of Arab descent yourself sir! So who do you mean when you say  it s time for pribumi to be masters of the country ?  user @denradityaa tweeted.  Baswedan is a descendant of the Hadrami tribe of Yemen and comes from a family of respected moderate Islamic scholars. Some took Baswedan s words to single out Chinese Indonesians - a minority that has faced long-running resentment for their control of trade and wealth in Indonesia.  There were also some supporters.  Why are people making a racket about pribumi? If you re born, raised and have Indonesian Id, you re a pribumi. Those who are mad with (the word) pribumi are not Indonesians,       @febrin_navarro wrote.  A spokesman for the governor did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but Baswedan was quoted by media as saying the comments referred to the colonial era.  The point is that (the word) was used to explain the Dutch colonial era,  he was quoted as saying. Baswedan and his deputy, Sandiaga Uno, won April s governor election on the back of support from hardline Islamists who have pushed, among other things, vitriolic anti-Chinese rhetoric.  A prominent Islamist leader, Bachtiar Nasir, who backed Baswedan s campaign, said the wealth of Chinese Indonesians was a problem and advocated an affirmative action program for native people.  Neighboring Malaysia runs a controversial affirmative action policy under which ethnic Malays and other indigenous populations enjoy entitlements such as quotas in universities and companies and cheaper property rates.    Indonesia s 250 million people are predominantly Muslim, but it has sizeable Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities and hundreds of ethnic groups.      Baswedan is ripping the national fabric...with the use of the word  pribumi ,  said Rian Ernest, an ethnic Chinese politician with the Solidarity Party of Indonesia.  We strongly condemn Baswedan s statement, which does not reflect the spirit of leadership or  unity in diversity ,  he added, referring to Indonesia s national motto. ",

        "title": "Displaced by mining, Peru villagers spurn shiny new town",
        "text": "NUEVA FUERABAMBA, Peru (Reuters) - This remote town in Peru s southern Andes was supposed to serve as a model for how companies can help communities uprooted by mining. Named Nueva Fuerabamba, it was built to house around 1,600 people who gave up their village and farmland to make room for a massive, open-pit copper mine. The new hamlet boasts paved streets and tidy houses with electricity and indoor plumbing, once luxuries to the indigenous Quechua-speaking people who now call this place home. The mine s operator, MMG Ltd, the Melbourne-based unit of state-owned China Minmetals Corp, threw in jobs and enough cash so that some villagers no longer work. But the high-profile deal has not brought the harmony sought by villagers or MMG, a testament to the difficulty in averting mining disputes in this mineral-rich nation. Resource battles are common in Latin America, but tensions are particularly high in Peru, the world s No. 2 producer of copper, zinc and silver. Peasant farmers have revolted against an industry that many see as damaging their land and livelihoods while denying them a fair share of the wealth. Peru is home to 167 social conflicts, most related to mining, according to the national ombudsman s office, whose mission includes defusing hostilities. Nueva Fuerabamba was the centerpiece of one of the most generous mining settlements ever negotiated in Peru. But three years after moving in, many transplants are struggling amid their suburban-style conveniences, Reuters interviews with two dozen residents showed. Many miss their old lives growing potatoes and raising livestock. Some have squandered their cash settlements. Idleness and isolation have dulled the spirits of a people whose ancestors were feared cattle rustlers.  It is like we are trapped in a jail, in a cage where little animals are kept,  said Cipriano Lima, 43, a former farmer. Meanwhile, the mine, known as Las Bambas, has remained a magnet for discontent. Clashes between demonstrators and authorities in 2015 and 2016 left four area men dead. Nueva Fuerabamba residents have blocked copper transport roads to press for more financial help from MMG. The company acknowledged the transition has been difficult for some villagers, but said most have benefited from improved housing, healthcare and education.  Nueva Fuerabamba has experienced significant positive change,  Troy Hey, MMG s executive general manager of stakeholder relations, said in an email to Reuters. MMG said it spent  hundreds of millions  on the relocation effort. Mining is the driver of Peru s economy, which has averaged 5.5 percent annual growth over the past decade. Still, pitched conflicts have derailed billions of dollars worth of investment in recent years, including projects by Newmont Mining Corp and Southern Copper Corp. To defuse opposition, President Pablo Kuczynski has vowed to boost social services in rural highland areas, where nearly half of residents live in poverty. But moving from conflict to cooperation is not easy after centuries of mistrust. Relocations are particularly fraught, according to Camilo Leon, a mining resettlement specialist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. Subsistence farmers have struggled to adapt to the loss of their traditions and the  very urban, very organized  layout of planned towns, Leon said.  It is generally a shock for rural communities,  Leon said. At least six proposed mines have required relocations in Peru in the past decade, Leon said. Later this month, Peru will tender a $2-billion copper project, Michiquillay, which would require moving yet another village. MMG inherited the Nueva Fuerabamba project when it bought Las Bambas from Switzerland s Glencore Plc in 2014 for $7 billion. Under terms of a deal struck in 2009 and reviewed by Reuters, villagers voted to trade their existing homes and farmland for houses in a new community. Heads of each household, about 500 in all, were promised mining jobs. University scholarships would be given to their children. Residents were to receive new land for farming and grazing, albeit in a parcel four hours away by car. Cash was an added sweetener. Villagers say each household got 400,000 soles ($120,000), which amounts to a lifetime s earnings for a minimum-wage worker in Peru. MMG declined to confirm the payments, saying its agreements are confidential. Built into a hillside 15 miles from the Las Bambas mine, Nueva Fuerabamba was the product of extensive community input, MMG said. Amenities include a hospital, soccer fields and a cement bull ring for festivals. But some residents say the deal has not been the windfall they hoped. Their new two-and-three story houses, made of drywall, are drafty and appear flimsy compared to their old thatched-roof adobe cottages heated by wood-fired stoves, some said. Many no longer plant crops or tend livestock because their replacement plots are too far away. Jobs provided by MMG mostly involve maintaining the town because most residents lack the skills to work in a modern mine. Many villagers spent their settlements unwisely, said community president Alfonso Vargas.  Some invested in businesses but others did not. They went drinking,  he said. Now basics like water, food and fuel - once wrested from the land - must be paid for.  Everything is money,  Margot Portilla, 20, said as she cooked rice on a gas stove in her sister-in-law s bright-yellow home.  Before we could make a fire for cooking with cow dung. Now we have to buy gas.  Some residents said they have benefited from the move. The new town is cleaner than the old village, said Betsabe Mendoza, 25. She invested her settlement in a metalworking business in a bigger town. Portilla, the young mom, says her younger sisters are getting a better education than she did. Still, the streets of Nueva Fuerabamba were virtually deserted on a recent weekday. Vargas, the community leader, said many residents have returned to the countryside or sought work elsewhere. Alcoholism, fueled by idle time and settlement money, is on the rise, he said. Some villagers have committed suicide. Over the 12 months through July, four residents killed themselves by taking farming chemicals, according to the provincial district attorney s office. It could not provide data on suicides in the old village of Fuerabamba. MMG, citing an  independent  study done prior to the relocation, said the community previously suffered from high rates of domestic violence, alcoholism, illiteracy and poverty. While the company considers the new town a success, it acknowledged the transition has not been easy for all.  Connection to land, livelihood restoration and simple adaptation to new living conditions remain a challenge,  MMG said. Nueva Fuerabamba residents continue pressuring the company for additional assistance. Demands include more jobs and deeds to their houses, which have yet to be delivered because of bureaucratic delays, said Godofredo Huamani, the community s lawyer. MMG said it stays apace of community needs through town hall meetings and has representatives on hand to field complaints. While villagers fret about the future, many cling to the past. Flora Huamani, 39, a mother of four girls, recalled how women used to get together to weave wool from their own sheep into the embroidered black dresses they wear.  Those were our traditions,  said Huamani from a bench in her walled front yard.  Now our tradition is meeting after meeting after meeting  to discuss the community s problems.

        "title": "Scotland can still offer choice on independence from UK: Sturgeon",
        "text": "GLASGOW, Scotland (Reuters) - Nicola Sturgeon told her Scottish National Party on Tuesday that Britain s impending exit from the European Union strengthened the case for Scottish independence from the UK and that her party still has a mandate to offer a choice.  With the UK government so engulfed in chaos and taking the country down a path of self-imposed decline, the need to (make the case for independence) has never been greater,  she told the party faithful gathered in Scotland s biggest city, adding that it was not clear when a new vote would be held.  We have a mandate to give the people that choice,  she said.  That mandate was won fairly and squarely. But exercising it must be done with the interests of all of Scotland at heart.  However Sturgeon, who also heads the devolved Scottish government, saw her party lose more than a third of its seats in Britain s June election after it mistimed a push for another vote on secession. In a 2014 referendum, Scotland voted to stay part of the UK. Two years later, when Britain held its referendum on EU membership, Scots voted overwhelmingly to stay but Britain as a whole voted to leave. The SNP said the prospect of being dragged out of the EU against their will meant Scots should revisit the question of independence. But the wider public does not seem to have embraced the prospect of yet another vote on constitutional change. This summer the SNP put vote plans on hold, and much of the conference centered on measures   such as doubling childcare and banning fracking   aimed at seizing the initiative and squaring up to criticism that it has been ignoring day-to-day affairs. As Brexit drags on, support for the EU in Scotland is rising, according to polls, but backing for Sturgeon s independence proposal has stayed roughly where it was in 2014. Britain s economy has slowed sharply this year as consumers felt the pinch from rising inflation, caused largely by a fall in the value of the pound and by weak wage growth. Some delegates expressed concern at the limited traction that they feel Scotland has regarding Brexit, the biggest change in British politics in 40 years. Scotland and Wales are angry because they say they have not been given a meaningful role in the Brexit process, something the UK government denies. They are threatening to withhold legislative consent to the UK government s EU withdrawal bill which they say would water down their devolved powers. The bill, currently going through parliament in London, is designed to convert all existing EU laws into domestic ones and is part of Britain s plan to provide legal clarity before it parts ways with the EU.  I think the SNP is being very vocal and people like (Scotland s Brexit minister) Mike Russell are doing a good job,  said Mhairi McCabe, 58, a retired food safety expert.  But I don t think they are being listened to. It s quite frustrating.  Infighting within the British government over the shape of Brexit means nothing can be taken for granted, Sturgeon has said, and Scotland will use the opportunity to continue to argue for the UK to stay in the European single market.

        "title": "U.S. to unveil streamlined autonomous vehicle guidelines Tuesday",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao will unveil on Tuesday streamlined safety guidelines for automakers that want to deploy self-driving vehicles, a person briefed on the matter said Monday, as members of Congress push their own proposals to remove regulatory barriers to the technology. The new Transportation Department policy is expected to offer the lighter regulatory touch that automakers have pushed for. For example, the Transportation Department is expected to state that automakers do not have to seek approval from regulators before putting self-driving vehicles on the road.  Separately, the National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday is expected to release findings that Tesla Inc\u2019s semi-autonomous Autopilot mode was a contributing factor in the May 2016 death of a motorist. That case has highlighted concerns about the design of systems that automate some, but not all, driving tasks. The new document is titled \u201cA Vision for Safety\u201d and will be less than half the length of the Obama administration guidelines released in September 2016 and will be less \u201cburdensome,\u201d the  person briefed on the announcement said. Chao is expected to make the announcement in Ann Arbor at a self-driving testing facility.  The Transportation Department is releasing its voluntary safety standards at the same time a bipartisan coalition in Congress is moving forward on legislation also designed to speed commercialization of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking their deployment.   On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted unanimously on a measure to clear legal obstacles that could discourage automakers and technology companies from putting self-driving cars into broader use. The House measure would allow automakers to field up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year. Over three years, the cap would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually. Automakers would be required to provide regulators with safety assessments of their systems, but would not have to get federal approval to put autonomous cars on the road. A group of senators introduced a similar draft bill on Friday. In September 2016, the Obama administration proposed that automakers voluntarily submit details of self-driving vehicle systems in a 15-point \u201csafety assessment\u201d and urged states to defer to the federal government on most vehicle regulations. An auto trade group representing General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp and others, objected to the Obama administration proposal. ",

        "text": "MADRID (Reuters) - DNA tests on the exhumed body of Salvador Dali showed that a Spanish woman who brought a paternity suit against him was not his daughter, the surrealist painter s foundation said on Wednesday. The court supervising the tests had informed its lawyers that Maria Pilar Abel was not Dali s biological daughter after comparing her DNA with samples taken from his remains, the foundation said in a statement. A spokesman for the court declined to confirm the results of the tests. Contacted by phone, Abel said she had not yet received the results from the court. The Madrid court in June ordered forensic scientists to exhume Dali s body after Abel, who was born in Dali s home town of Figueres, filed a paternity claim that alleged her mother had an affair with him.  This conclusion is not a surprise for the Foundation, since at no point has there been any evidence that she was a relative,  said the foundation, which manages Dali s estate.  The Foundation is happy that this puts an end to an absurd and artificial controversy.  Dali, who died in 1989 aged 84, was one of the 20th century s most famous and easily recognized artists. His paintings include  The Persistence of Memory , with its iconic images of melting clocks, and he also turned his hand to movies, sculpture and advertising. ",

        "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two former associates of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie were convicted on Friday for their roles in the \u201cBridgegate\u201d lane closure scandal, following a six-week trial that served to further tarnish the Republican\u2019s damaged reputation. Bridget Kelly, the governor\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were found guilty in Newark federal court on all counts. They were convicted of fraud, conspiracy and depriving the residents of Fort Lee, New Jersey, of their civil rights. Christie, who is in charge of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s transition team, has not been criminally charged, but the scandal has torpedoed what was once seen as a promising political career. Christie on Friday again denied having had any advance knowledge of the scheme to choke traffic heading for the busy George Washington Bridge, which links New Jersey and Manhattan.  \u201cI had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments, and had no role in authorizing them,\u201d Christie said in a statement following the verdict. \u201cAnything said to the contrary over the past six weeks in court is simply untrue.\u201d The scandal has dogged Christie, once seen as a potential presidential nominee before his campaign for the White House failed this year. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta said on Friday Trump should ask Christie to resign as head of his transition team. Legal experts have said it is unlikely Christie would face any criminal consequences based on the trial testimony.  Baroni and Kelly were accused of shutting down access lanes to the bridge in September 2013 in Fort Lee, New Jersey, creating a massive days-long traffic jam to punish the town\u2019s mayor, Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for declining to endorse Christie\u2019s reelection campaign. The Port Authority, which runs the bridge, says it is the world\u2019s busiest, carrying 102 million vehicles a year on the I-95 interstate highway, a major east coast traffic artery. Lawyers for Kelly and Baroni vowed to appeal. \u201cThis is not over,\u201d Kelly\u2019s lawyer Michael Critchley said outside the courthouse, with his arm around his weeping client. He said the judge had erred during jury instructions. Defense lawyers were furious when U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton told jurors in response to a question they could convict Kelly and Baroni on conspiracy even if the act itself was not \u201cintentionally punitive toward Mayor Sokolich.\u201d Wigenton said prosecutors did not have to prove motive, even though their case had revolved around the political retribution. \u201cBy answering the way you\u2019re answering, you\u2019re directing a verdict of guilty,\u201d an angry Critchley told Wigenton on Tuesday. Baroni\u2019s lawyer, Michael Baldassare, told reporters the case was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and said the conviction would be overturned. \u201cI am innocent of these charges,\u201d a smiling Baroni said. Kelly and Baroni\u2019s co-conspirator, former Port Authority official and confessed mastermind David Wildstein, had earlier pleaded guilty and appeared as the government\u2019s star witness, detailing how the three schemed to pay back Sokolich. But Wildstein also implicated Christie, saying he and Baroni discussed the lane closures with the governor while they were ongoing. Christie, Wildstein testified, laughed at the notion that Sokolich was frustrated by the traffic. At the time, Christie believed that securing the backing of Democratic officials would burnish his national reputation, according to trial testimony. Kelly, who took the stand in her defense, testified she had discussed the lane closures with Christie a month beforehand, though she said she thought at the time they were part of a legitimate traffic study. \u201cI take no pleasure in this verdict,\u201d said U.S. Attorney of New Jersey Paul Fishman, a successor of Christie in that position. Fishman, whose office prosecuted the case, said he was saddened by the conduct of top government officials. Kelly and Baroni\u2019s lawyers argued that Wildstein had orchestrated the plot himself and told them he was conducting a traffic study. Wildstein said on the stand the three of them knew all along that the study was a bogus cover story. Prosecutors showed jurors numerous exchanges that Kelly and Baroni each had with Wildstein, who operated as liaison between Baroni at the Port Authority and Kelly in the governor\u2019s office. Those included Kelly\u2019s now-infamous email to Wildstein that prosecutors said launched the scheme, in which she wrote, \u201cTime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\u201d Kelly and Baroni are scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 21. Each faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the most serious charge of fraud, though it is unlikely they would receive such a lengthy term. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Republican at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, known for his critical views on corporate penalties, expressed some support on Friday for imposing them in cases in which companies violate foreign bribery laws. \u201cI am generally comfortable with assessing civil monetary penalties in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases,\u201d Acting SEC Chairman Michael Piwowar said in remarks at the Practising Law Institute\u2019s \u201cSEC Speaks\u201d conference. \u201cAccording to academic literature, there is evidence that when such violations are revealed to the market, the stock price does not always fall, and may even increase,\u201d he added. Piwowar\u2019s comments come at a time when many on Wall Street have been questioning whether the Justice Department and the SEC will ease enforcement of the FCPA. Prior to being elected, President Donald Trump expressed concern about the FCPA, calling it a \u201chorrible law\u201d that should be changed. In addition, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the SEC, attorney Jay Clayton, previously chaired a committee at the New York City Bar Association which drafted a paper that was somewhat critical of how the law was being enforced. Clayton is still awaiting U.S. Senate confirmation. Piwowar\u2019s comments suggest there is likely to be some support among SEC commissioners to continue pursuing foreign bribery cases, given the impact FCPA disclosures have on share prices. Piwowar is well known for being critical about how the SEC decides when to assess corporate penalties generally, amid concerns that sizeable fines against public companies may in some cases unduly punish ordinary shareholders who are already victims of the alleged wrongdoing. He previously voted against imposing penalties against JPMorgan Chase & Co over its \u201cLondon Whale\u201d trades. The SEC did not win authority from Congress to seek penalties until 1990, and even then, the agency was slow to embrace the practice until after the major accounting scandals at companies like Enron and Worldcom. But in 2006, then-SEC Chair Chris Cox shifted gears amid concerns from some SEC officials about corporate penalties and issued guidance that spells out factors the commission should consider when determining whether to levy them. Piwowar said on Friday he closely follows those guidelines. \u201cIt is entirely appropriate to discipline and punish corporate malefactors who violate our laws,\u201d  he said.  But the SEC must \u201cremember the innocent investors\u201d who are also victims, he added. ",

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has planned for a vote next week on revised legislation, unveiled on Thursday, and he has his work cut out for him in the coming days to get the 50 \u201cyes\u201d votes needed for passage. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin and cannot afford to lose more than two from within their ranks because of united Democratic opposition, but two Republican senators already have declared opposition. \u201cAfter all of these years of suffering thru Obamacare, Republican Senators must come through as they have promised,\u201d Trump, who made gutting Obamacare one of his central campaign promises last year, wrote on Twitter from Paris, where he attended Bastille Day celebrations. The top U.S. doctors\u2019 group, the American Medical Association, on Friday called the new bill inadequate and said more bipartisan collaboration is needed in the months ahead to improve the delivery and financing of healthcare. Hospital and medical advocacy groups also have criticized the bill. \u201cThe revised bill does not address the key concerns of physicians and patients regarding proposed Medicaid cuts and inadequate subsidies that will result in millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage,\u201d AMA President Dr. David Barbe said, referring to the government insurance program for the poor and disabled. A major test for McConnell\u2019s legislation expected early next week is an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which last month forecast that the prior version of the bill would have resulted in 22 million Americans losing  insurance over the next decade. A day after that CBO analysis was issued, McConnell postponed a planned vote on the legislation because of a revolt within his own party, including moderates and hard-line conservatives. While the bill\u2019s prospects may look precarious, the same could have been said of healthcare legislation that ultimately was passed by the House of Representatives. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called off a vote in March in the face of a rebellion involving the disparate factions of the party but managed to coax enough lawmakers to back it and engineered narrow approval on May 4. Vice President Mike Pence sought to shore up support among the nation\u2019s governors at a meeting in Rhode Island, but a key Republican governor, Ohio\u2019s John Kasich, came out strongly against the revised bill, saying its Medicaid cuts were too deep and it does too little to stabilize the insurance market. Kasich\u2019s opposition could put pressure on Rob Portman, a  Republican senator from Ohio, who has not yet taken a position on the bill. If the current Senate legislation collapses, some lawmakers have raised the possibility of seeking bipartisan legislation to fix parts of Obamacare but leaving intact the structure of the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, commonly known as Obamacare. \u201cThere are changes that need to be made to the law,\u201d Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told MSNBC, citing \u201ca bipartisan appetite to tackle this issue.\u201d Moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul already oppose the revised Senate bill. Other Republican senators have either expressed concern or remained noncommittal, including Portman, Mike Lee, Shelley Moore Capito, John McCain, Dean Heller, John Hoeven, Lisa Murkowski, Jeff Flake, Ben Sasse, Cory Gardner, Todd Young and Thom Tillis. Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy floated an alternative plan. The new version was crafted to satisfy the Republican Party\u2019s various elements, including moderates worried about Americans who would be left without medical coverage and hard-line conservatives who demand less government regulation of health insurance. A provision championed by Republican Senator Ted Cruz and aimed at attracting conservatives would let insurers sell cheap, bare-bones insurance policies that would not have to cover broad benefits mandated under Obamacare. But two major health insurance groups, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, called on McConnell to drop the Cruz proposal, saying it would undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions, raise insurance premiums and destabilize the individual insurance market. The bill retained certain Obamacare taxes on the wealthy that the earlier version would have eliminated, a step moderates could embrace. But it kept the core of the earlier bill, including ending the expansion of Medicaid that was instrumental in enabling Obamacare to expand coverage to 20 million people, and restructuring that social safety-net program. John Thune, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said in order to complete work on the bill by the end of next week, Senate leaders would have to try to formally begin debate on Tuesday or Wednesday, a move that requires a majority vote.

        "title": "Britain's \"Madame Brexit\" tells Poland: Your constitution is your own matter",
        "text": "WARSAW (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May gave Poland a rare dose of big power support on Thursday by saying that its constitution was its own affair, a sharply different tone to that of the European Union which has scolded Warsaw over judicial reforms. The EU executive launched an unprecedented action against Poland on Wednesday, calling on other EU member states to prepare to sanction Warsaw if it fails to reverse judicial reforms that Brussels says pose a threat to democracy. When asked about the Commission s move to deploy the  nuclear option  under Article 7 of the 2009 Lisbon treaty, May said:  These constitutional issues are normally, and should be primarily a matter for the individual country concerned.  Speaking alongside Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Warsaw, May said:  Across Europe we have collective belief in the rule of law.    I welcome the fact that Prime Minister Morawiecki has indicated that he will be speaking with the European Commission and I hope that that will lead to a satisfactory resolution.  While the EU executive has censured Polish ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski s push to have control of judicial appointments, May is seeking to court Poland as an ally in Brexit negotiations and key military partner against Russia. Poland has said reforms are necessary while like-minded allies in Hungary have indicated they will veto the ultimate sanction of suspending Poland s voting rights in the bloc. At one point, a translator s slip made Morawiecki appear to cast May as  Madame Brexit , though in fact he said in Polish:  as Madame PM said, Brexit is Brexit . May said Britain and Poland had signed a defense and security cooperation treaty which deepens cooperation on training, information sharing and capability development. On the eve of a visit by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to Moscow, May said Vladimir Putin s Kremlin was trying to weaponise information and undermine a rules-based international system.  We are both deeply concerned by Russia s attempts to weaponise information,  she told reporters.  The Kremlin is seeking to undermine the international rules-based system and it will not succeed.  Morawiecki said he hoped France and Germany were aiming to work out the best solution with Britain as it leaves the EU  I have deep hopes and conviction that our French and German partners aim to work out the best solution in this new, not easy situation that we are in with respect to Brexit,  Morawiecki said.

        "title": "Indonesia demands answers after military chief denied U.S. entry",
        "text": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia intends to send a diplomatic note to the U.S. secretary of state and summon Washington s deputy ambassador in Jakarta to explain why the head of its military was denied entry to the United States, Indonesian officials said on Sunday. Armed Forces Commander General Gatot Nurmantyo was about to board a flight on Saturday when the airline informed him that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection had denied him entry, military spokesman Wuryanto told a news conference in Jakarta. Nurmantyo was going to the United States at the invitation of General Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, to attend a Chiefs of Defense Conference on Countering Violent Extremism being held in Washington on Oct. 23-24, Wuryanto said. It was not clear why he was stopped from entering the United States, Wuryanto said, adding that the general did not have any problem during his visit to the United States in February 2016.  We ve asked for clarification to the U.S., to the Department of State as well as the embassy in Jakarta and until now we re still waiting for that clarification,  Indonesia s Foreign Affairs Minister Retno Marsudi told Reuters. The ministry s spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir earlier said Indonesia s embassy in Washington was to send a diplomatic note to the U.S. secretary of state demanding explanation for the incident.The ministry will also summon the U.S. deputy ambassador in Jakarta on Monday to seek explanation, Nasir said, adding that the ambassador is presently not in Indonesia. The U.S. embassy in Jakarta said in a statement it was in touch with Nurmantyo s staff to facilitate his travel, but did not explain further.  U.S. Ambassador Joseph Donovan has apologized to Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi for any inconvenience to General Gatot,  the embassy wrote.  We remain committed to our Strategic Partnership with Indonesia as a way to deliver security and prosperity to both our nations and peoples.  Nurmantyo has frequently courted controversy in Indonesia because of his actions and what analysts perceive as his political ambitions. The general promotes the notion that Indonesia is besieged by  proxy wars  involving foreign states and even a renewed communist threat. Indonesian President Joko Widodo said this month that the armed forces should stay out of politics and ensure their loyalty is only to the state and the government. Indonesia, the world s biggest Muslim-majority country, generally enjoys good ties with the United States although in the past ties between the two countries  armed forces have been strained by alleged rights abuses involving Indonesia s military.

        "title": "Exclusive: Mexican leftist has 11-point lead ahead of 2018 election - poll",
        "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has an 11-percentage point lead ahead of next year s presidential election, according to an opinion poll taken in the last week, giving him a sizeable advantage even after new rivals formally entered the race. The former Mexico City mayor Lopez Obrador has vowed to combat inequality and corruption, but some international investors are concerned about suggestions that he might reverse parts of the government s 2013-14 energy legislation. The poll, carried out and financed by Mexican public opinion firm Parametria, was provided exclusively to Reuters ahead of wider publication later on Tuesday. It was taken between Dec.14 and Dec.17. It found that 31 percent of those asked who they would vote for if the election were today would choose Lopez Obrador, followed by former Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade, seeking nomination for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), on 20 percent. Ricardo Anaya, former leader of the center-right National Action Party (PAN) was third on 19 percent, the poll said. Anaya resigned this month to pursue the presidency in an alliance with the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). The Parametria poll also included potential independent candidates, former first lady Margarita Zavala and Nuevo Leon Governor Jaime Rodriguez, giving them 10 percent and 2 percent respectively. Of the 800 people surveyed, 18 percent answered none of the listed candidates, did not know or did not reply. The Parametria poll is the first conducted since Lopez Obrador joined up with the conservative Social Encounter Party (PES), sparking worries among his progressive backers.  But the controversial alliance appears to have had little immediate effect on his advantage. The poll shows Lopez Obrador slightly further ahead than a survey by Mexican newspaper El Universal published in early December that gave him an eight-point lead. A survey by pollster Mitofsky, also from early December, showed a much closer race, with Lopez Obrador on 23 percent of the vote, followed by Anaya with 20 percent support and Meade with 19 percent.  Lopez Obrador unveiled his planned cabinet last week, including tapping a moderate U.S.-trained economist for finance minister and splitting the posts evenly between women and men.   The Parametria poll was conducted face-to-face and has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.  Mexican political parties have until March to formally register candidates. ",

        "text": "ROME (Reuters) - The United Nations is preparing to deploy 150-250 mostly Nepalese guards to Libya to protect its base in the capital as part of a plan to return its operations to the country, U.N. officials said on Friday. Backed by Western governments, the U.N. is trying to heal a rift between Libya s rival factions in order to stabilize the country and to tackle militant violence and people-smuggling from Libya s northern coast.  The mission has been based in Tunis since 2014, when fighting among rival Libyan brigades forced out most foreign embassy staff, but it has gradually increased its presence in Libya and has been planning for months for a fuller return. The military unit would probably consist of around 150 guards, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, told a news briefing in Geneva. Most will be Nepalese.  To make sure that we protect our colleagues as they deploy in Tripoli there will be a guard unit which will be basically U.N. military personnel coming from Nepal,  Lacroix said.  U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame told Italian newspaper La Stampa that  a little under 250  could be deployed in the  coming weeks . Deploying the guards to the base in Tripoli  will mean that around the beginning of October we can carry out a significant part of our work in Libya,  said Salame, who has headed the mission since June. A spokesperson for the mission said there were no plans to send U.N. peacekeepers to Libya. Security in Tripoli and other parts of western Libya is fragile, and armed groups that are largely unaccountable hold power on the ground.  Most foreign embassies closed and pulled out their staff in 2014 when heavy fighting between rival factions destroyed the capital s airport. It was the worst fighting since the fall of long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Libya slipped into turmoil after the NATO-backed uprising that toppled Gaddafi. A U.N.-backed government set up in Tripoli last year has struggled to assert its authority and is opposed by factions that control eastern Libya.  In July, rival leaders pledged in Paris to work toward elections in 2018 and a conditional ceasefire. Salame said constitutional and electoral laws would have to be written to ensure any vote brought lasting change.  We need to be sure everyone accepts the final result,  he said.  Let s not forget that presidential elections would be the first ever.  Salame also expressed frustration at competing international initiatives in Libya, where regional and European powers have vied for influence.   I think the proliferation of initiatives, of mediations, does not help,  he said. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said he hoped that after his country s efforts a revision of the 2015 U.N.-mediated deal that created the Tripoli government could be reached under Salame s auspices. Discussion has centered on reforming the government s leadership and power over military appointments.  It seems that efforts are converging,  Le Drian told reporters during a visit to Moscow.     ",

        "title": "'Wave of humanity' puts aid agencies to the test in Bangladesh",
        "text": "DHAKA/KUTUPALONG, Bangladesh (Reuters) - How do you feed and shelter nearly half a million traumatized people who have made their way, over the course of just one month, to a spit of monsoon-soaked land where 300,000 refugees are already living in squalor? That is the challenge for aid workers scrambling to help the Rohingya Muslims now crowded into the Cox s Bazar region of southern Bangladesh after a spasm of violence in Myanmar s Rakhine state sent them fleeing across the border.  Nothing comparable, in terms of the number of people arriving in such a short space of time, has happened since 1994 in Rwanda,  said Christopher Lom, Asia-Pacific spokesman for the International Organization for Migration (IOM). About 480,000 men, women and children have arrived in Cox s Bazar since the end of August, according to United Nations estimates. Most came with nothing more than the clothes they wore. Nearly 200 of the women have given birth since they arrived and another 20,000 are pregnant. Meeting the needs of such a vast number - indefinitely, because there is nowhere else for them to go - in one of the poorest regions of a poor country is a logistical nightmare for the Bangladesh government, U.N. agencies and aid organizations. There was a taste of what was to come in October and November last year, when a smaller outbreak of violence brought and influx of 80,000 Rohingya. That prompted improvements in infrastructure and coordination in Cox s Bazar, said the United Nations  local chief coordinator, Robert Watkins.  It was working extremely well,  he said.  And then we got this wave of humanity, and we were overwhelmed.  U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said after a visit to Cox s Bazar this week that the most urgent needs were shelter, clean water and sanitation.  Really the first order of business, the first challenge, is to get people out of the mud and the despair in which they are finding themselves into a place where organized relief can be provided,  he told a news conference in Geneva.  The combination of limited health facilities, poor sanitary and hygiene conditions and overcrowded sites ... is a recipe for disaster in terms of possible epidemics.  So far 475 tonnes of aid have arrived at Chittagong airport north of Cox s Bazar, much of it from Muslim-majority countries shocked by the killings and torching of villages in northwestern Rakhine, which U.N. officials have branded ethnic cleansing. While the initial response was chaotic, say aid experts, due to the sheer volume of people arriving, Bangladesh has since won some praise for improvements in organization. At a Sept. 14 meeting in the prime minister s office in Dhaka, the authorities made 22 decisions to remove logistical hurdles. According to a document reviewed by Reuters, these included building 14 storage warehouses, regulating aid distribution,   protecting orphans, building roads and power infrastructure, and setting up shelters for more than 500,000 people. Mohammad Shah Kamal, Bangladesh s secretary of disaster management and relief and the main coordinator of the aid effort, said the armed forces were scanning shipments of aid and transporting them from airports and ports to Cox s Bazar, where local officials take charge of distribution.  I think everyone has been surprised at the Bangladeshi government,  said Karim Elguindi, a senior World Food Program official in Cox s Bazar, noting that it was  fast-tracking everything , had offered police support and helped with customs delays. But the Inter-Sector Coordination Group, which is leading the humanitarian response to the influx of Rohingya, said in a recent update that basic coordination was still lacking because staff and agencies had not been assigned to specific camps. Bangladesh hopes to make room for new arrivals by building a 2,000-acre camp in the Ukhia area of Cox s Bazar. The U.N. says much of this area is not suitable for habitation because it lacks water, sewerage and roads, but many refugees are already settling there anyway. Complicating aid efforts are private civic and religious groups that throw food and clothes off the back of trucks, which experts say is no way to get relief to the neediest. Thousands of tarpaulin shelters that refugees have built in recent weeks stretching across dozens of small hills and rice paddies are only accessible by long walks across flimsy bamboo bridges.   Families in one of the most remote parts of the sprawling Kutupalong refugee camp, a 40-minute walk from the nearest official distribution point, said they mostly rely on handouts from relatives to survive.   Mushtaq Ahmed, 66, a religious teacher, sheltering from the rain under a tarpaulin, said he has resorted to begging to buy rice for his children and grandchildren.   He has tried to throw himself into the scramble for aid thrown from trucks but comes away with nothing.  There are too many people rushing,  he said.  I am too weak to get it.   ",
