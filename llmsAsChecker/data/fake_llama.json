        "title": " McConnell Says He\u2019ll Obstruct ANY Effort To Hire Independent Special Prosecutor",
        "text": "Siding with Trump s Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Trump s spokesperson, McConnell told America from the floor of the Senate that he sees no reason to assign an independent special prosecutor or create a bipartisan committee to get to the bottom of Trump s relationship to Russia.JUST NOW: McConnell says new investigation will only impede current work on Russia investigations.(so no special prosecutor or committee)  John Berman (@JohnBerman) May 10, 2017McConnell was rebuffing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer s renewed call for an independent investigator. I have said from the get-go that I think a special prosecutor is the way to go, but now with what s happened it is the only way to go,  Schumer told reporters on Tuesday.Instead, McConnell said he would leave that up to the FBI   and let Jeff Sessions handpick Comey s  interim  (read: non-confirmed) FBI head, something that is not standard procedure.News: AG Sessions & Deputy AG Rosenstein interviewing potential interim FBI directors today, according to a DOJ official (@LauraAJarrett)  David Wright (@DavidWright_CNN) May 10, 2017Another deeply disturbing sign they need a handpicked interim Director? Why is the default, Andy McCabe, not sufficient? https://t.co/92pagYV5e7  Ned Price (@nedprice) May 10, 2017By picking the next FBI director outside of the typical process   and circumventing a confirmation hearing   the White House hopes to get an ally in the middle of the investigation   another strong motive for firing Comey in the first place. Even if a full-time replacement eventually comes along, the dysfunction and partisanship created in this scenario could make the entire case dissolve. If you were a witness who knew of criminal wrongdoing from someone on Trump s team and you just watched the FBI director get fired and replaced by someone handpicked by Trump s close friend would you want to come forward? It s clear Trump sure hopes not.McConnell is enabling all of this. As usual. In a show of loyalty to the president, McConnell slammed Democrats who had called for an independent investigation and instead went on a lengthy rant about Obamacare and what he thought of as  Democratic hypocrisy. Senator McConnell has decided to side with the White House in their spin that they fired Director Comey as a favor to Democrats.  Matt House (@mattwhouse) May 10, 2017In a moment where the country can be said to be facing a real constitutional crisis, McConnell is choosing to smear his Democratic enemies and stand with undemocratic strongarm tactics from a president. It was a disgusting display of partisanship in the face of an unprecedented move by a sitting president to silence his critics and kill an investigation into his own wrongdoing. Having watched McConnell spend a decade refining the art of obstruction, it appears that this final act of obstruction of justice will be his masterpiece.Featured image via Aaron P.

        "title": "LOL! PRESIDENT TRUMP Wants Network Who Pushes Most #FakeNews Coverage \u201cOf Your Favorite President (me)\u201d To Receive A HILARIOUS Award",
        "text": "Earlier today, President Trump tweeted:  We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!

They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2017Is President Trump correct when he says the media has treated him unfairly? Well, an interesting study from the far-left leaning Harvard University, provided stunning evidence that proves President Trump is 100% correct:  Chicago Tribune  Harvard University s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy has come out with a study of media coverage of the Trump White House in its first 100 days.It is astonishing because it comes from Harvard, not exactly the bedrock of American conservatism.The study found that in Trump s first 100 days in office, the tone of the news coverage of the president has been a whopping 80 percent negative to 20 percent positive.So what does fair and balanced really mean, anyway? It confirms what most people understand,  said Tom Bevan, publisher and co-founder of RealClearPolitics, one of the go-to websites for media and political junkies.Bevan spoke as a guest on  The Chicago Way  podcast that I co-host with WGN-AM radio producer Jeff Carlin. The response will be that Trump is deserving of this kind of coverage because he s conducted himself inappropriately, and these are self-inflicted wounds, and the press is doing nothing but covering him and his actions. But that s a little bit disingenuous,  Bevan said.So how was President Obama covered in his first 100 days? With a 60-40 positive to negative ratio, according to the Harvard study. That s a significant shift, a significant difference,  says Bevan.  I think this is reflective of the fact that the media does root from the press box and they do cheer for certain personalities and they do cheer against others. I have my own memory of the media s tone after Obama took office. It wasn t merely positive, it was adoring, gushy, in the way a small child looks up to a beloved parent, or a dog to the master who gives it biscuits.It was as if the media were hugging a magical unicorn. Obama wasn t only given the benefit of the doubt. He was handed the Nobel Peace Prize though he hadn t done anything to earn it. And critics were trashed as nothing but racists.Obama controversies, from his administration s gun running scandal in the  Fast and Furious  debacle to using the Internal Revenue Service as a weapon against conservative groups, were covered, somewhat. But generally, the tone was muted, respectful, nothing like it was for Trump or the Clintons.Later, in Hillary Clinton s failed 2016 campaign, leaks of Democratic National Committee email   whether hacked by the Russians or not   demonstrated collusion between journalists and Democrats. But that cozy relationship has never properly been addressed, and that avoidance undermines the credibility of journalism as the media challenges Trump. Because of the way the press covered Obama, they lost so much credibility,  Bevan said.  And because they did not take these things seriously, the IRS Scandal, Fast and Furious, you could go down the list of where they turned the other cheek.   And now where they re giving Trump the third degree on everything, that makes the contrast all that much greater. So you have a certain segment of the public, the people who voted for Trump, who literally do not trust what the media says. And the divide between rigidly defined political tribes, one courted by the media, the other dismissed by it, grows even wider. It s not good for journalism, and it s not good for the country,  said Bevan. ",

        "title": "RARE INTERVIEW WITH WHITE HOUSE SECRETARY: Bill Clinton Had Affairs With \u201cthousands of women\u201d\u2026\u201dMonica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made\u201d",
        "text": "This is a mind-blowing interview that confirms much of what many of us suspected about the Clintons. For some, it may be even worse than what they believed to be true. Kudos to Linda Tripp for agreeing to do this interview. People who cross the Clinton s do usually fare too well In a rare interview, Linda Tripp, a pivotal figure in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, revealed on Sunday it was common knowledge while she worked in the West Wing that Bill Clinton had affairs with  thousands of women. Speaking on  Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,  Tripp for the first time divulged that she personally knew another White House staffer aside from Lewinsky who was also having an affair with Clinton. That unnamed staffer was mentioned by Tripp in various depositions but she has not spoken about it publicly.She charged that Hillary Clinton not only knew about her husband s exploits,  She made it her personal mission to disseminate information and destroy the women with whom he dallied. Tripp says she cringes at the sight of Clinton presenting herself as  a champion of women s rights worldwide in a global fashion, and yet all of the women she has destroyed over the years to ensure her political viability continues is sickening to me. Tripp documented evidence of Lewinsky s phone calls about her relationship with Bill Clinton and submitted the evidence to independent counsel Kenneth Starr, leading to the public disclosure of the affair. She explained to Klein that she did so because she believed her own life and Lewinsky s were in danger, saying that Lewinsky was threatening Clinton with outing the relationship.Tripp also used the interview to criticize what she says is the news media s unwillingness to investigate the Clintons. She singled out and thanked Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report, declaring that without him  things would have been very, very different. Drudge s website was the first media outlet to break the Lewinsky scandal after Newsweek sat on the story.Tripp had unique access to the Clintons because her office was directly adjacent to Hillary s second floor West Wing office for the entire time she served in the Clinton White House from 1993 to the summer of 1994 with the exception of the first three months of the Clinton administration, when she sat just outside the Oval Office.Tripp s nonpartisan position was a carryover from the George H. W. Bush administration in which she served. Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made She told Klein that her role in the Lewinsky case followed  years of alarm at what I had seen in the Clinton White House, particularly Hillary and the different scandals, whether it was Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater, Vince Foster. All of the scandals that had come before and were so completely obliterated in the mind s eye of the American people because of the way all of them were essentially discounted. So I watched a lying President and a lying First Lady present falsehoods to the American people. So my dismay predated the January 1998 period when the Monica Lewinsky scandal surfaced. To me it was very important that the American people see what I was seeing. My years with the Clintons were so disturbing on so many levels. Tripp maintains that she went public with the Lewinsky evidence to ensure the intern s safety as well as her own.She told Klein:I say today and I will continue to say that I believe Monica Lewinsky is alive today because of choices I made and action I took. That may sound melodramatic to your listeners. I can only say that from my perspective I believe that she and I at the time were in danger, because nothing stands in the way of these people achieving their political ends.I think that had it not become public when it did, particularly in light of the Paula Jones lawsuit, which was coming to a head with President Clinton s deposition, that we may well have met with an accident. It s a situation where unless you lived it as I did you would have no real framework of reference for this sort of situation.Tripp said the young Lewinsky, 21-years-old when she entered the White House as an intern, was unaware of the danger that she faced.She described Lewinsky as a  young girl, smart, clever   but in this one area she was blinded and she fancied herself in love. He fancied himself entitled. It was nothing more than a servicing agreement. She romanticized that there was an affair. And when it didn t pan out the way she had hoped it would   he had promised her he would bring her back to the White House as soon as the 1996 election campaign had finished. When he didn t, she essentially lost her mind and started acting in erratic and frightening ways. Threatening the president.There came a point in July of 1997 when she not only threatened to expose the affair, as she referred to it. But also she at that time informed him that I knew all about it. So at that time it became dangerous for Monica and for me. This was something that absolutely could never see the light of day. And she never realized the implications of threatening a president or her behavior. And I did.Tripp told Klein that  the biggest fallacy that most people believed is that this was a unique occurrence. Monica was somehow special. And regrettably that s the farthest thing from the truth. She said,  Everyone knew within the West Wing, particularly those who spent years with him, of the thousands of women. Now most of your listeners might find that difficult if not impossible to believe. And I can tell you in the beginning I felt the same way. But let me be clear here. This is a pattern of behavior that has gone on for years. And the abuse of women for years. Asked whether Clinton was having affairs with others in the West Wing, Tripp replied,  I know that to be true. One in particular who I will not name told me this herself. But as to the hundreds or thousands, remember I worked closely with the closest aides to the president. And it was a loosey-goosy environment so there was not a lot of holding back. So it was common knowledge, let s put it this way, within the West Wing that he had this problem. It was further common knowledge that Hillary was aware of it. Tripp described the tense West Wing atmosphere between what she characterized as two almost diametrically opposed Clinton camps.The dynamic between the two groups   the Bill Clinton people and the Hillary Clinton people. It was as though they were almost opposing forces. But I can tell you that the one with the power and the one that instilled the fear in the other was the Hillary camp.And the [Bill] Clinton people would cower if she were coming into the area, just as an example, of the Oval without notice. There would be scurrying around to make sure there was no one in the wrong place at the wrong time, shall we say. It was a fascination to see the amount of energy that was expended covering up his behavior. It was horrifying.Tripp said Hillary personally targeted Bill s female conquests and accusers, with the future presidential candidate exhibiting behavior that is  egregious and it s so disingenuous. In my case, for instance, right after the Lewinsky story broke, she was heard directing her staff to get anything and everything on Linda Tripp. So the defamation of character and the absolute assurance that my credibility would be destroyed began right away. And it happens with any woman who is involved in any way, either with him in a physical relationship or an assault or anything that can endanger their political viability.Tripp recalled Hillary s January 27, 1998 appearance on NBC s The Today Show in which she was seen as standing by her husband while blaming the Lewinsky scandal on a  vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president. She didn t do it in an honest way,  said Tripp of Clinton s NBC interview.  Instead she lied, which didn t surprise me. And I will give her credit. She is enormously effective. And became a victim. A wife who was betrayed. This is someone who had no real personal problem with any of this behavior. The problem was in it becoming public. They had to continue to become electable  She was the more aggressive one in ensuring that the political viability was not endangered in any way. Tripp told Klein that Hillary  does not possess integrity on any level. I just wish that your listeners could know the person that I knew. Because if they did there is not a chance she would be elected president. Tripp s ringside seat afforded her rare insight into the scandals of the 1990s and perhaps alleged wrongdoings to come, with the West Wing employee personally witnessing behavior that may have foreshadowed Clinton s email scandal, in which she is accused of sending classified materials through her personal server.Tripp said she noticed major differences in the manner in which classified material was handled by both the Clinton and Bush administrations in which she served.President George H.W. Bush s administration had  a completely different way of operating on every level, including on classified and secret material,  she said.She continued:All the regulations were followed, right down to a cover sheet being essential if the document had had any sort of classifications. The securing of classified documentation in safes. The burn bags that were used if any sensitive material was to be disposed of. All of this was familiar to me and followed every security protocol that I had experienced in the past.When the Clintons came in this was one of the things that I found appalling right from day one. And it went hand and hand with the disdain for the military. The military was present in the White House in the form of presidential aides. The aide that carried the nuclear football, just as an example. And in the Bush White House they were respected, as they should be. In the Clinton White House, they were disdained. To see it treated this way and to see these people treated this way was disturbing.Tripp referred to Clinton s private mail woes as  classic Hillary Clinton in a nutshell. She gets to decide what she does. Look, the rules don t apply to the Clintons. If you understand that basic premise you understand the Clintons. For Tripp, Clinton s use of a private server was  all about control. She has a need to control every single aspect of her life. And you know anyone in government knows that any key stroke on a keyboard within a government agency belongs to the government  it is not up to the employee on any level to control what happens to it for posterity.

        "text": "Laurence Tribe, who was Ted Cruz s own Constitutional Law professor at Harvard, visited MSNBC s The Last Word, to discuss Cruz s total lack of understanding on, and general contempt for, the Constitution of the United States.Professor Tribe said point blank that Ted Cruz only cares about the Constitution when it benefits Ted Cruz, or if he can use it as a weapon to hurt other Americans. Otherwise, he could not care less if the Constitution says you have a right he doesn t want you to have.You really can t argue with Professor Tribe s assessment of Cruz on that. He couldn t be more correct.Professor Tribe spoke briefly to the recent  birther  attacks put forth against Cruz by fellow Republicans and Donald Trump. He said that these attacks brought into light the glaringly obvious example of how Ted Cruz simply chooses to interpret the Constitution in any way that is convenient for him at the time, with no regard to the actual law.What this does is give us a window into the character of Ted Cruz. The sort of person he is, with respect to the American Constitution. Whats intriguing   it was true even when he was my student years ago   he used to believe in  originalism,  that is the Constitution always means what it meant when it was adopted- Except when it s not convenient for him to mean that. This is a perfect example.If the Constitution always meant what he claims, namely that if you got an American mother it doesn t matter where in the world you re born, you become a natura born citizen at birth. Well then, why in the world did congress need to pass a law dealing with naturalization and immigration in 1934, saying  from now on, although it wasn t true before, if you have a mother who s an American citizen, thats good enough? Source: MSNBCTribe s example seems innocent enough, but it speaks to a larger issue where Cruz simply doesn t care about constitutional law. Remember   we were still torturing people as recently as 7 years ago, regardless of what the Constitution said. Professor Tribe continued on even further in criticizing him even further, saying the Cruz he taught constitutional law to at Harvard is nothing like the Cruz of today. He implied that it was like the Cruz of today never studied constitutional law at all. Tribe also touched on some of Cruz s other comments, where he said that the Supreme Court s word has no impact on the law of the land. Professor Tribe could only describe it as  Scary.

        "text": "If there s one news organization that Donald Trump can usually always rely upon to be in his corner, it s Fox News. The media branch of the Republican party will pretty much always show bias towards any Republican candidate or conservative ideal. Most of the time even without trying to find any facts of any kind.However, it looks as though Trump is going to hate the new poll that Fox News revealed showing who, according to them and their viewers, won the first presidential debate.Winning with 61% of viewers polled was none other than Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.In fact, Trump was only able to garner 21% of those polled to say that he won, with 12% saying it was a tie.New Fox Poll: Who won first debate? #SpecialReport https://t.co/lmsmO06yfj pic.twitter.com/coMvS84lCj  Fox News (@FoxNews) September 30, 2016If you re any good at math, that s not even close. Not even remotely close. Hillary got well more than half of those polled saying that she definitively won, while Trump probably held onto the few who were going to say that he won no matter what.The bar is set so incredibly low for Trump, too. If he kept his pants on, those 21% pulling for Trump were still going to say that he won. So, for Hillary to sweep up this debate as a win in her column with even Fox News viewers, well, that s bad news for Trump and his floundering campaign.It will be interesting to see how he behaves in the next debate to try to sway viewers.Featured Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images, Twitter",

        "title": " Donald Trump\u2019s Immigrant Wife May Have Committed Visa Fraud",
        "text": "This is the hypocrisy to beat all hypocrisies.As we all know, Donald Trump is vehemently anti-immigration. In fact, it s the centerpiece of his campaign going all the way back to June 2015 when he rode an escalator to a podium and delivered a speech officially throwing his hat into the ring.Since then, the Republican nominee has accused immigrants of being criminals who steal jobs from Americans.Well, now it looks like the same can be said of Trump s own wife Melania, who came to the United States from Slovenia.According to an investigation by Politico, Melania may very well have committed visa fraud and other immigration laws. And Trump s campaign has apparently been lying about her immigration story.In January, Melania claimed that she often flew back to Slovenia to renew an H-1B visa, a visa type that Donald Trump despises and has said he would end. It never crossed my mind to stay here without papers,  she told Harper s Bazaar.  That is just the person you are. You follow the rules. You follow the law. Every few months you need to fly back to Europe and stamp your visa. After a few visas, I applied for a green card and got it in 2001. But H-1B visas last three years and can be extended to up to six years, which means the First Lady wannabe did not have to fly back to Slovenia for renewal.As it turns out Melania is describing something people do when they aquire a B-1 Temporary Business Visitor or B-2 Tourist Visa, which means she is lying about the circumstances of her immigration to this country. Furthermore, it could also mean she took a modelling job away from an American citizen because her nude photo shoot occurred in the United States in 1995 and B-1 and B-2 visa holders are not allowed to work here. So Melania may have broken the law.Andrew Greenfield, an attorney specializing in immigration law, made that pretty clear. If you enter the United States with the intention of working without authorization and you present yourself to a border agent at an airport or a seaport or a manned border and request a visa, even if there is not a Q&A   knowing that you are coming to work   you are implicitly, if not explicitly, manifesting that you intend to comply with the parameters of the visa classification for which you sought entry and were granted entry. Another immigration attorney told Politico that if Melania used a B-1 visa she would have had to lie about the purpose of her entry into the country. She would not have been authorized to work in the U.S. while on a B-1 visa. In fact, if a customs agent encounters someone entering the U.S. on a B-1 visa and they know that the individual intends to work for a U.S. employer, the individual will usually be denied admission. In order to avoid being sent back to Slovenia, she may have had to lie about the purpose of her trip. In short, Melania Trump could be guilty of committing visa fraud which is a crime that would seriously jeopardize her green-card status and her United States citizenship.If she were not married to the Republican nominee and were of Hispanic or Muslim descent, Donald Trump would be calling for her to be deported and would be referring to her as an illegal immigrant and a criminal.It sounds like Donald Trump, his wife, and the Republican Party have some serious explaining to do.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",

        "text": "Clifton Park, New York is the latest school to succumb to Muslim prayer rooms. We ve documented this trend across America of Islam creeping into the schools. The latest case in San Diego of Sharia Law being taught in the classrooms has ended up in court:FEDERAL LAWSUIT Filed Against San Diego School District s Pro-Islam, Pro-Sharia Law PolicyOne question should be asked with this infiltration of Muslim prayer in our schools: WHAT ABOUT ALL OF THE OTHER RELIGIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BANNED FROM DOING ANYTHING CLOSE TO PRAYING IN SCHOOL?  The largest school district in Saratoga County says it will allow Muslim students to pray in rooms in at its  high school.The Shenendehowa High School Principal says classrooms are being set aside so Muslim students can pray during Ramadan. Since then, we ve heard from parents who are against the move.One parent sent us a letter explaining her concerns saying:  Since prayer for other religions was removed from school years ago, I feel as Shen has crossed the line on allowing this on campus.  Some folks we talked to in Clifton Park agreed, like David Chapleau.  You just can t bring religion into a public institution where were really trying to teach kids to the idea of opening their critical faculties,  Chapleau said. The woman s outcry is in response to an email from the Shenendehowa High School Principal to students and parents. It addresses the month of Ramadan, a time of fasting and prayer for Muslims. It says, in part: Prayer occurs on a daily basis for practicing Muslims. This can be challenging in today s modern public high school. In an attempt to make reasonable accommodations for students and employees to meet their personal religious obligations, room 65 in High School West and room 109 in High School East have been set aside so students can incorporate this important aspect of their religion into their daily activities while at school.  The letter explains two classrooms will be set aside for students to meet their religious obligations during school hours. A school spokesperson says the decision was made after the high school principal met with the leader of a local mosque in an attempt to improve the school s cultural proficiency. She says the school can t refuse a student s request to leave class for required prayer, and says the space allows Muslim students to return to class quickly after praying.READ MORE: CBS6LOCAL",

        "text": "HERE WE GO yet another statue of a military hero is reportedly under fire. This figure astride a horse was vandalized with the spray-painted words  Tear It Down .Who was this historical figure? General Lee? Stonewall Jackson? Nathan Bedford Forrest?No, this was a figure who hails from the north.Of France:The phrase  Tear it Down  was hastily sprayed in black paint across the base of the golden Joan of Arc statue on Decatur Street in the French Quarter sometime earlier this week. It has since been removed, with only the vaguest traces of the paint remaining. The  Tear it Down  tag would seem to relate to the debate surrounding the city s ongoing removal of four Confederate monuments. But the statue of Joan of Arc, a 15th-century military leader, martyr and Catholic saint, hasn t been mentioned in the controversy to this point.Amy Kirk Duvoisin, the founder of the annual Joan of Arc parade that ceremonially pauses at the statue on the first day of Carnival season, says she s confused by the vandalism. Surely, people realize she s not related to American history,  she said referring to the French icon.Nah, I wouldn t be so sure.KEEP JOAN OUT OF THIS!According to plaques accompanying the statue, the sculpture of Joan of Arc, who is also known as the Maid of Orleans, was  a gift of the people of France to the citizens of New Orleans  in 1972.On May 1 in Paris, the controversial former right-wing Nationalist Front Party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, known for his restrictive views on French immigration, led a rally at a duplicate golden statue of Joan of Arc in Paris.The Monumental Task Committee, an organization that describes itself as being devoted to  preserving, restoring and protecting monuments,  is soliciting for donations through its website to restore the Joan of Arc statue.Read more: NOLA ",

        "text": "After working for months to build a solid white supremacist base, Donald Trump suddenly started focusing on minority  outreach  last week. But CNN commentator and New York Times columnist Charles Blow explained just who these efforts are really aimed at, and it isn t African-Americans.According to Blow, Trump s minority  outreach  isn t aimed at people of color at all. Rather, his message is targeting white moderate Republicans who have reservations about voting for a raging bigot. Blow said that this is  the most horrible form of bigotry. It is the kind of bigotry that says,  I will knock you down while I pretend to pick you up,'  Blow said.  It says that,  I m not talking to you, I m talking to the guy behind you or over your shoulder.  It s the kind of bigotry that says,  I m urinitaing on you and telling you to dance in the rain.' Blow said that he has spent the past week trying to find out if Trump s bullsh*t message had resonated with any people of color. Here s a shocker, it didn t. Blow said this just goes to show that Trump s  outreach  isn t reaching anybody except for right-leaning whites. It is the moderate ones who say,  I don t want to be the woman/man who votes for the racist guy, and if this guy can now change his opinion, I do want to be conservative, but I don t want to be the conservative who votes for the racist guy, and now he s different,'  Blow said. Actually, he s not different. He s not talking to us. He s pretending to talk to us while he talks to you. This is an insult to all people of color, black, Hispanic and otherwise, because he s using us as pawns, and you do not get an out,  Blow continued.  He was a bigot yesterday, he s a bigot today, and he ll be a bigot tomorrow, and if you vote for him, you re voting for a bigot. That s it.

        "text": "21st Century Wire says Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980 s and has been a featured guest on Patrick Henningsen LIVE at 1100KFNX.  In this report, Robert asks due to mainstream media experts who ve fallen to  careerism , whom can we trust to deliver us the information to describe the world and its conflicts. (Image   Former Secretary of State, Colin Powell addressing the United Nations on Feb. 5. 2003)Robert Parry Consortium NewsThe looming threat of World War III, a potential extermination event for the human species, is made more likely because the world s public can t count on supposedly objective experts to ascertain and evaluate facts. Instead, careerism is the order of the day among journalists, intelligence analysts and international monitors   meaning that almost no one who might normally be relied on to tell the truth can be trustedThe dangerous reality is that this careerism, which often is expressed by a smug certainty about whatever the prevailing groupthink is, pervades not just the political world, where lies seem to be the common currency, but also the worlds of journalism, intelligence and international oversight, including United Nations agencies that are often granted greater credibility because they are perceived as less beholden to specific governments but in reality have become deeply corrupted, too.In other words, many professionals who are counted on for digging out the facts and speaking truth to power have sold themselves to those same powerful interests in order to keep high-paying jobs and to not get tossed out onto the street. Many of these self-aggrandizing professionals   caught up in the many accouterments of success   don t even seem to recognize how far they ve drifted from principled professionalism.A good example was Saturday night s spectacle of national journalists preening in their tuxedos and gowns at the White House Correspondents Dinner, sporting First Amendment pins as if they were some brave victims of persecution. They seemed oblivious to how removed they are from Middle America and how unlikely any of them would risk their careers by challenging one of the Establishment s favored groupthinks. Instead, these national journalists take easy shots at President Trump s buffoonish behavior and his serial falsehoods   and count themselves as endangered heroes for the effort.FOILS FOR TRUMPIronically, though, these pompous journalists gave Trump what was arguably his best moment in his first 100 days by serving as foils for the President as he traveled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Saturday and basked in the adulation of blue-collar Americans who view the mainstream media as just one more appendage of a corrupt ruling elite.Breaking with tradition by snubbing the annual press gala, Trump delighted the Harrisburg crowd by saying:  A large group of Hollywood celebrities and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom  and adding:  I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from [the] Washington swamp   with much, much better people.  The crowd booed references to the elites and cheered Trump s choice to be with the common folk.Trump s rejection of the dinner and his frequent criticism of the mainstream media brought a defensive response from Jeff Mason, president of the White House Correspondents  Association, who complained:  We are not fake news. We are not failing news organizations. And we are not the enemy of the American people.  That brought the black-tie-and-gown gathering to its feet in a standing ovation.Perhaps the assembled media elite had forgotten that it was the mainstream U.S. media   particularly The Washington Post and The New York Times   that popularized the phrase  fake news  and directed it blunderbuss-style not only at the few Web sites that intentionally invent stories to increase their clicks but at independent-minded journalism outlets that have dared question the elite s groupthinks on issues of war, peace and globalization.THE BLACK LISTProfessional journalistic skepticism toward official claims by the U.S. government   what you should expect from reporters   became conflated with  fake news.  The Post even gave front-page attention to an anonymous group called PropOrNot that published a black list of 200 Internet sites, including Consortiumnews.com and other independent-minded journalism sites, to be shunned.But the mainstream media stars didn t like it when Trump began throwing the  fake news  slur back at them. Thus, the First Amendment lapel pins and the standing ovation for Jeff Mason s repudiation of the  fake news  label.Yet, as the glitzy White House Correspondents Dinner demonstrated, mainstream journalists get the goodies of prestige and money while the real truth-tellers are almost always outspent, outgunned and cast out of the mainstream. Indeed, this dwindling band of honest people who are both knowledgeable and in position to expose unpleasant truths is often under mainstream attack, sometimes for unrelated personal failings and other times just for rubbing the powers-that-be the wrong way.Perhaps, the clearest case study of this up-is-down rewards-and-punishments reality was the Iraq War s WMD rationale. Nearly across the board, the American political/media system   from U.S. intelligence analysts to the deliberative body of the U.S. Senate to the major U.S. news organizations   failed to ascertain the truth and indeed actively helped disseminate the falsehoods about Iraq hiding WMDs and even suggested nuclear weapons development. (Arguably, the  most trusted  U.S. government official at the time, Secretary of State Colin Powell, played a key role in selling the false allegations as  truth. )Not only did the supposed American  gold standard  for assessing information   the U.S. political, media and intelligence structure   fail miserably in the face of fraudulent claims often from self-interested Iraqi opposition figures and their neoconservative American backers, but there was minimal accountability afterwards for the  professionals  who failed to protect the public from lies and deceptions.PROFITING FROM FAILUREIndeed, many of the main culprits remain  respected  members of the journalistic establishment. For instance, The New York Times  Pentagon correspondent Michael R. Gordon, who was the lead writer on the infamous  aluminum tubes for nuclear centrifuges  story which got the ball rolling for the Bush administration s rollout of its invade-Iraq advertising campaign in September 2002, still covers national security for the Times   and still serves as a conveyor belt for U.S. government propaganda.The Washington Post s editorial page editor Fred Hiatt, who repeatedly informed the Post s readers that Iraq s secret possession of WMD was a  flat-fact,  is still the Post s editorial page editor, one of the most influential positions in American journalism.Hiatt s editorial page led a years-long assault on the character of former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson for the offense of debunking one of President George W. Bush s claims about Iraq seeking yellowcake uranium from Niger. Wilson had alerted the CIA to the bogus claim before the invasion of Iraq and went public with the news afterwards, but the Post treated Wilson as the real culprit, dismissing him as  a blowhard  and trivializing the Bush administration s destruction of his wife s CIA career by outing her (Valerie Plame) in order to discredit Wilson s Niger investigation.At the end of the Post s savaging of Wilson s reputation and in the wake of the newspaper s accessory role in destroying Plame s career, Wilson and Plame decamped from Washington to New Mexico. Meanwhile, Hiatt never suffered a whit   and remains a  respected  Washington media figure to this day.CAREERIST LESSONThe lesson that any careerist would draw from the Iraq case is that there is almost no downside risk in running with the pack on a national security issue. Even if you re horrifically wrong   even if you contribute to the deaths of some 4,500 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis   your paycheck is almost surely safe.The same holds true if you work for an international agency that is responsible for monitoring issues like chemical weapons. Again, the Iraq example offers a good case study. In April 2002, as President Bush was clearing away the few obstacles to his Iraq invasion plans, Jose Mauricio Bustani, the head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], sought to persuade Iraq to join the Chemical Weapons Convention so inspectors could verify Iraq s claims that it had destroyed its stockpiles.The Bush administration called that idea an  ill-considered initiative    after all, it could have stripped away the preferred propaganda rationale for the invasion if the OPCW verified that Iraq had destroyed its chemical weapons. So, Bush s Undersecretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton, a neocon advocate for the invasion of Iraq, pushed to have Bustani deposed. The Bush administration threatened to withhold dues to the OPCW if Bustani, a Brazilian diplomat, remained.It now appears obvious that Bush and Bolton viewed Bustani s real offense as interfering with their invasion scheme, but Bustani was ultimately taken down over accusations of mismanagement, although he was only a year into a new five-year term after having been reelected unanimously. The OPCW member states chose to sacrifice Bustani to save the organization from the loss of U.S. funds, but   in so doing   they compromised its integrity, making it just another agency that would bend to big-power pressure. By dismissing me,  Bustani said,  an international precedent will have been established whereby any duly elected head of any international organization would at any point during his or her tenure remain vulnerable to the whims of one or a few major contributors.  He added that if the United States succeeded in removing him,  genuine multilateralism  would succumb to  unilateralism in a multilateral disguise Continue this report at Consortium News READ MORE US NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire US FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",

        "text": "With the passing of the legendary music icon Prince, many have been going to their music libraries to binge listen to everything they own that was done by the musician. It s a way for people to both grieve and celebrate the life of such an immense talent that was a gift to everyone he came in contact with, whether personally, or through his music.Yet, digging through the very large amount of music that Prince was a part of, it turns out that in the 90s Prince wrote a song called  Donald Trump (Black Version)  put out by the group  The Time.  Upon listening to the lyrics, it seems it s a song that has a man trying to be everything to a woman by buying her affection.Here s a brief taste of the lyrics: Honey baby, you truly know it. You truly know it. You look good. Tryin  your best to show it. If I were you, I would. True love and affection. These are nice, so nice but when a money man walks in the room, girl, you look more than twice. You look once, you look twice. Can I rap to you sugar tonight?(chorus) Donald Trump (black version), maybe that s what you need. A man that fulfills your every wish, your every dream. Donald Trump (black version), come on take a chance. A 1990 s love affair, the real romance. Flash forward to 2016, and the real Donald Trump is trying to buy the nation s affection to win himself the White House, even though he has no diplomatic, policy, or political experience whatsoever.Hopefully, money can only buy the Donald Trump s of the world love and not the presidency.Listen to the entire song here:Featured Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images",

        "text": "Huma Abedin, Hillary s right hand woman, told in testimony that she burned Hillary s schedules in a  burn bag  during her tenure as Secretary of State. Even though the experts in this field are saying burning your schedule has never been done before, is their any doubt that this is just more underhanded secrecy from Hillary Clinton? Federal Records Act anyone? I ve never seen anyone put their schedule in the burn bag   because every one of them had a state.gov email address and therefore their daily schedules became public records, as required by law. Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton s longtime aide, testified last week that her boss burned her schedules while serving as secretary of state.  If there was a schedule that was created that was her Secretary of State daily schedule, and a copy of that was then put in the burn bag, that   that certainly happened on   on more than one occasion,  Abedin told lawyers representing conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, according to the New York Post. While Clinton admitted to deleting personal emails from her homebrew server, this is the first time anyone in Clinton s State Department inner circle admitted to destroying public records while on the job.The  burn bag  is used to discard sensitive or classified documents. A former State Department employee told the New York Post it was unprecedented for a diplomat to handle schedules this way.  I spend eight years at the State Department and watched as four U.S. ambassadors and two secretaries of state shared their daily schedules with a variety of State Department employees and U.S. officials,  Richard Grenell, a former diploma and U.S. spokesman at the United Nations told the Post.  I ve never seen anyone put their schedule in the burn bag   because every one of them had a state.gov email address and therefore their daily schedules became public records, as required by law,  Grenell added. Others who the newspaper talked to suggested the carefulness in how she discarded her schedule highlighted her carelessness when it came to using a private email server.  The president s schedule was not classified but it was deemed  highly sensitive,  noted Brad Blakeman, a scheduler for President George W. Bush.  Instructions were given at the White House and on the road that schedules would be disposed of through the use of  burn bags  and/or shredding,  Blakeman told the Post. Read more: Daily Mail",

        "text": "Has the entire world gone mad with political correctness? Is there any chance of saving the UK from itself? UPDATE: Labour Party politician Sadiq Khan has been elected London mayor   the first Muslim to lead Europe s largest city.Election officials say Khan defeated Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith by more than 300,000 votes, after first- and second-preference votes were allocated.The result came early Saturday, more than 24 hours after polls closed.Khan was elected to replace Conservative Mayor Boris Johnson after a campaign marked by U.S.-style negative campaigning.Goldsmith, a wealthy environmentalist, called Khan divisive and accused him of sharing platforms with Islamic extremists.Khan, who calls himself  the British Muslim who will take the fight to the extremists,  accused Goldsmith of trying to scare and divide voters in a proudly multicultural city of 8.6 million people   more than 1 million of them Muslim.Londoners go to the polls on Thursday to choose a replacement for the outgoing Mayor, Boris Johnson MP. Despite the fact the Labour Party is currently mired in an anti-Semitism scandal, if all things remain equal, expect the party s candidate Sadiq Khan MP to be confirmed in the early hours of Friday morning.Mr. Khan, 45, has had a successful career in the Labour Party, being elected to parliament in 2005, becoming a Minister of State in 2008 with a promotion in 2009. He was a Shadow Secretary of State for Justice from 2010-15, and has been running for London Mayor since then.POLLINGIn fact, as I predicted in January, the polls have changed very little since the beginning of the year. This is despite a negative-ad onslaught by the Conservative Party and its candidate Zac Goldsmith   the multi-millionaire son of Eurosceptic royalty Sir James Goldsmith, and brother of socialite and Vanity Fair editor Jemima Khan.Mr. Goldsmith and his  Back Zac  campaign have used the last few months to highlight Sadiq Khan s proximity to Islamic extremists, extremism, and this past weekend, to anti-Semitism.But perhaps it speaks to the mindset of Londoners, and certainly the British capital s demographic shift, that such news has scarcely affected Mr. Khan.In January, a YouGov poll put Mr. Goldsmith on 35 to Mr. Khan s 45 per cent. When you take into account London s supplementary voting system, the numbers after the second preference votes are counted ended up 45-55 to Mr. Khan.Last week, that number stood at 40-6o to Mr. Khan. After second preference votes, the extremist-adjacent candidate has a 20 point poll lead.While last week s events   when one of Mr. Khan s most prominent backers Ken Livingstone was implicated in a Hitler/anti-Semitism scandal   may serve to keep some of Mr. Khan s voters at home, it is hard to imagine the Conservatives overturning such a drastic poll lead.A MUSLIM MAYOR?Polling suggests some people are nervous about having someone like Mr. Khan near an office that wields so much power, responsibility, and cash.Private conversations with Westminster insiders often see Lutfur Rahman   the former Mayor of Tower Hamlets   raised as another example of a prominent Muslim mayor.Mr. Rahman was removed from office, accused by critics of playing sectarian politics with the area s Muslim population, of backing Islamists, and of distributing tax payer cash to his favoured Muslim groups to secure their support.Mr. Rahman was found guilty of  corrupt and illegal practices    and has perhaps set back the plight of the few, integrated British Muslims in elected life. He   alongside politicians like Humza Yousaf, Sayeeda Warsi, Rushanara Ali, Shabana Mahmood, Yasmin Qureshi, Amjad Bashir, Naz Shah, and Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh   have created a deep distrust between British voters and Muslim politicians.In fact one third of Londoners remain suspicious of having a Muslim Mayor, and the likes of Sajid Javid or Syed Kamall suffer because of their co-religionists  insistence on fellow-travelling with extremists, if not holding extremist views themselves.EXTREMISMAnd Mr. Khan can hardly claim a clean record. Mr. Goldsmith s attacks are not without basis, though they have been shrugged off as  racism  or  Islamophobia  with the assistance of the left s useful idiots like Owen Jones.Apart from his somewhat threatening statements about not voting for him while claiming that  he is the West , Mr. Khan s own track record is perhaps one of the most sour of all Muslim politicians in the Western world.In 2001 he was the lawyer for the Nation of Islam in its successful High Court bid to overturn the 15-year-ban on its leader, Louis Farrakhan.In 2005 and 2006 he visited terror-charged Babar Ahmad in Woodhill Prison. Mr. Ahmed was extradited to the U.S. in 2012, serving time in prison before being returned to the UK in 2015. Mr. Ahmed pleaded guilty to the terrorist offences of conspiracy, and providing material support to the Taliban.And Mr. Khan also campaigned for the release and repatriation of Shaker Aamer, Britain s last Guantanamo detainee, who was returned to the UK in November.Both Messrs Aamer and Ahmed provided Mr. Khan with links to the advocacy group CAGE, which described the Islamic State executioner Mohammed Emwazi as a  beautiful young man , and which has campaigned on behalf of both men. Mr. Khan is reported to have shared a stage with five Islamic extremists, including at sex-segregated events. Even so, his poll numbers remain firm.On Friday morning, Londoners will likely get the news that their mayor for the next four years is a man with the judgement, priorities, and fellow travellers as laid out above. This, combined with an annual  16bn budget, and an army of police, bureaucrats, and officials, would make Mr. Khan one of the most powerful Muslims in the Western world.For entire story: Breitbart News ",

        "text": "Bill O Reilly is back! And if you listen to his first podcast on his website BillOReilly.com you d almost think nothing happened. O Reilly uses his first podcast to announce he ll be broadcasting his show every Monday though Friday and that eventually, he plans to turn it into an actual news program. But will Bill O Reilly s own website be enough for his gigantic ego? Will it be enough for the fans who are used to turning on the TV and don t want to go to their computer or phone to watch him?Bill has built the largest conservative audience on TV. Many of his loyal fans are convinced the Murdoch brothers have used these allegations against him as an excuse to remove him from their network as they work to bring the FOX News channel more to the center and away from its right-leaning roots.O Reilly was dismissed overnight following allegations of sexual harassment by at least six women. It has been reported that Lachlan s wife Sarah Murdoch helped influence the decision. Last year the former Fox News creator, Roger Ailes, was sacked in similar circumstances, going on to advise Donald Trump s presidential campaign.It has also been suggested by many social media users that Roger Ailes and Bill O Reilly might form their own conservative leaning news network to compete against FOX News.In any case, for those who are missing the voice of a man they ve listened to for over 20 years Here you go.Bill O Reilly s first podcast started out like this (audio is below):Hey, I missed you guys.Welcome to the No Spin News on BillOReilly.com, a completely different experience than what you ve had in the past. And everybody is listening this week, or can listen Monday through Thursday.Next week we ll go back to just Premium Members only for the No Spin News, a service for you.So, what we re going to do here is about fifteen minutes, twelve minutes of the headlines. This is an extended Talking Points Memo that will cover the world each day.And then as we develop the website, we ll have guests and things like that, and this will become longer and longer and longer, into a genuine news program.That s the vision right now.I am sad that I m not on television anymore. I was very surprised how it all turned out. I can t say a lot, because there s much stuff going on right now.But I can tell you that I m very confident the truth will come out, and when it does, I don t know if you re going to be surprised   but I think you re going to be shaken, as I am. There s a lot of stuff involved here.Now, I can t say anymore because I just don t want to influence the flow of the information. I don t want the media to take what I say and misconstrue it. However you, as a loyal O Reilly listener, have a right to know, I think, down the lane what exactly happened. And we are working in that direction, okay?Click on this LINKO'Reilly's back!

        "text": "Following Covfefe-gate, in which Trump made an absolute fool of himself and Spicer managed to make an even bigger fool of the whole White House, Trump decided to get back down to business by taking aim at a truly pressing issue   Hillary Clinton. Because of course he did. She gave an interview in which she discussed her electoral college loss, and because Trump can t do anything but attack his imaginary enemies, he took to Twitter to call her  Crooked Hillary  once again.However, Hillary appears to have been ready for that. Covfefe apparently isn t going away anytime soon, and she used it to hit him back on his sheer hypocrisy, saying,  People in covfefe houses shouldn t throw covfefe. It s not the content of her tweet that s remarkable, though. What she did was outshine Trump on Twitter by nearly 10 to 1 on retweets, and 5 to 1 on likes. Take a look below:If Trump s popularity is of such concern to him, this will have him livid if he sees it. She owned him right after he tried to tell all of Europe that he s the most important person on the planet. And the popularity of her tweet plays right into Trump s ongoing insecurity about the legitimacy of his presidency, since she won the popular vote by nearly 3 million.It s actually shocking that he didn t pass out electoral maps in Europe to prove how beloved he is here. But then again, he doesn t know what that map actually shows   all he sees is all the red and assumes that means everyone in America, with a few isolated exceptions, is behind him.Hillary is by no means perfect, and she wouldn t have been the perfect president. But she also wouldn t be humiliating us repeatedly the way that Trump does. Trump is making a mockery of the U.S.Image of Hillary by Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images for The Foundation for Women.

        "text": " 21st Century Wire says This latest episode of the Democratic Party s epic meltdown is perhaps the most embarrassing of them all. The ghosts of Hillary s defeat continue to haunt the halls of Washington and media headlines, as party operatives and their media surrogates conjure up old plots, as well as new and innovative ways to change the election results.Since Hillary Clinton s devastating defeat at the hands of underdog Republican nominee, and now President-Elect, Donald Trump, both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party leadership have been desperately trying to claw-back the election result, or at least damage and delegitimize the incoming Trump Administration. After blaming FBI Director James Comey for Clinton s loss, party operatives, in conjunction with George Soros-backed MoveOn.org, then went on to organize street protests which turned into riots, before backing Green Party leader Jill Stein in her frantic attempt to stage a voter recount in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania   all designed to somehow reverse, or discredit Trump s historic presidential win.The only problem with this leg of the Establishment s subscribed conspiracy theory   is that it is based on a lie. Media hype aside   there is no actual evidence, beyond speculation that Russia hacked US Elections, or even hacked Clinton chief of staff John Podesta s emails posted on Wikileaks. That lie is evident right there plain sight, as Democratic Party leaders falsely state that the CIA has concluded the  Russians  hacked or interfered in the US Presidential election. The CIA never concluded anything, they simply said  the Russians probably did it.  Regardless, here s what Democrats are putting out as their lead talking point: We now know that the CIA has determined Russia s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American.  (see full letter below).Despite the lack of any actual proof, the same Clinton media operatives that skewed campaign coverage, polling in their candidate s favor, and who also fabricated Trump scandals throughout the election   are now running a hysterical PR campaign  are pushing the Russian hacking conspiracy theory  with absolutely no proof to substantiate their incredible claims.Desperate to rescue his collapsed reputation, John Podesta, along with Democrat minority leader Nancy Pelosi (image, left) are now lobbying the CIA to release  evidence  it doesn t actually have   and give it to state delegate voters in the US Electoral College before they cast their official Presidential votes on December 19th.It seems as if disgraced party operative Podesta might just be digging a deeper hole for himself and his party The HillMore Democratic electors are joining the call for an intelligence briefing on Russian interference in the presidential election before they cast their votes for president on Monday.Twenty-nine electors now are pressuring Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to disclose more information about the CIA s conclusion that Russian interference helped sway the election in President-elect Donald Trump s favor.On Monday, 10 electors   spearheaded by Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.)   wrote an open letter to Clapper, demanding more information ahead of next week s vote. The Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump, his campaign or associates, and Russian government interference in the election, the scope of those investigations, how far those investigations may have reached, and who was involved in those investigations,  the letter reads.  We further require a briefing on all investigative findings, as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr. Trump is fit to serve as President of the United States. Twenty-eight Democrats and one Republican have now signed the letter.On Monday, the Clinton campaign voiced support for the effort. Each day that month, our campaign decried the interference of Russia in our campaign and its evident goal of hurting our campaign to aid Donald Trump,  said John Podesta, Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman, in a statement.  Despite our protestations, this matter did not receive the attention it deserved by the media in the campaign. We now know that the CIA has determined Russia s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American.

        "title": " Netanyahu Whines About U.N. Resolution, Refuses To Abide By Terms Like A True Tyrant",
        "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threw a temper tantrum like a petulant child because the United Nations finally passed a resolution condemning Israel s illegal settlements.For decades, Israel has been seizing more and more territory for themselves from the Palestinian people as nations around the world, including the United States oppose what they are doing. All the while, Israel has been fragrantly ignoring what the rest of the world thinks even as America continues to give Israel billions of taxpayer dollars to combine with their own military budget, a military they have repeatedly used to commit genocide against Palestinians.The best solution for peace is a two-state solution, but Israel rejects the idea because they want the land for themselves.And that forced President Obama and United States Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power to abstain from a U.N. vote on a resolution condemning the Israeli settlements. Applause within the United Nations broke out upon passage, proving that the world is tired of the conflict in the Middle East and wants to end it even if it means Israel does not get everything it wants.But Netanyahu threw a hissy fit in a statement on Friday whining about the resolution and accusing President Obama of abandoning Israel. Israel categorically rejects the despicable anti-Israeli resolution at the UN, and will not adhere to it,  the Prime Minister s Office said in a seething statement after the council voted in favor of the motion 14-0. While the Security Council does nothing to prevent the massacre of half a million people in Syria, it is shamefully singling out Israel   the only democracy in the Middle East. The Obama administration not only failed to defend Israel from this harassment at the UN, it cooperated with it behind the scenes. Israel is looking forward to working with President-elect Trump and with out friends in Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, to undo the damage of this absurd resolution. In reality, while President Obama still supports Israel s right to exist, he refuses to let Netanyahu bully us. For years, Netanyahu has refused to halt the settlements that prevent peace talks from moving forward. He has also been itching to start a war against Iran so he can sit back and watch as our troops fight and die doing Israel s dirty work.And frankly, if President Obama really hatred Israel, he would have let Iran wipe it off the f*cking map years ago and would never have approved the ridiculous $38 billion in military aid over the next ten years that Israel is about to receive. Also, past presidents have also supported resolutions condemning Israeli settlements, including Ronald Reagan.Perhaps Netanyahu should have respected President Obama instead of insulting him repeatedly over the years like when he delivered an address to Congress rebuking him for working with Iran to reduce their nuclear development. Let s keep in mind that President Obama succeeded in getting Iran to the table and both sides were able to come to a diplomatic agreement. Iran is now complying by giving up their centrifuges. If Netanyahu had his way, we would be at war with Iran, something he can now talk Trump into actually doing.If Netanyahu really wanted peace talks, he would have halted the settlements years ago. But Netanyahu and his right-wing government have no interest in peace. They have become frighteningly similar to the Nazis over the years as they kill Palestinians indiscriminately and advocate genocide against them. One would think that a people whose history is full of tragedies like the Holocaust would avoid trying to commit one themselves. But Netanyahu has dragged Israel to the extreme right-wing.Now Netanyahu is about to have Trump by his side, an egomaniac who hates Muslims as much as he does, which could mean the restart of perpetual war in the Middle East for our military or worse since Trump is obsessed with using nuclear weapons.So it looks like Putin isn t the only foreign leader who got a puppet in the White House. Israel did, too. And the world could be set on fire if we continue letting Israel bully us.Featured image via Press TV",

        "title": "HOW OBAMA MADE IT POSSIBLE For Protesters To Be ARRESTED And Sent To JAIL For Disrupting Trump Rallies",
        "text": "So is anyone else wondering why the cop-hating, racist, Bernie Sanders supporter Tommy DiMassimo wasn t arrested and charged with a felony? Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s campaign rallies have become a fixture in the 2016 election season as much for the candidate s rambling speeches as for the frequent interruptions of said speeches.Demonstrators have filed in to Trump rallies across the country, shouting their anti-Trump messages and promptly being ridiculed by rally-goers and led out by law enforcement.On Saturday, Trump began to call for the arrest of protesters as he was repeatedly interrupted, raising questions about the legality of protest and whether Trump can press charges against demonstrators. So what are the answers?The short answer is, no.According to H.R. 347 (signed into law by Barack Hussein Obama in February, 2012) it is ILLEGAL under CURRENT FEDERAL to protest of any type, in an area under protection by the U.S. Secret Service.Because Donald Trump is under Secret Service Protection (as is Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders) and has been since November of 2015, it is a FEDERAL CRIME to protest at campaign rallies, and is in fact, punishable by imprisonment.Free Speech isn t covered at ANY Trump, Clinton, Sanders (or Cruz, Rubio, Kasich) rally because protests are considered to be  knowingly impeding or disrupting the orderly conduct of an official Federal function. Law enforcement has simply tossed out protesters at Trump rallies, but H.R. 347 states that they could be imprisoned for up to a year for trespassing.Demonstrators are technically relegated to free speech zones much like the ones seen on college campuses.Such zones are often used to keep dissenters away from media attention, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.At a recent Trump event at Valdosta State University, in Georgia, the two designated free speech zones were not in sight of the arena where the rally was held. One was a quarter mile away.Trump can call for the arrest of whomever he wants, but he can t do the arresting.He has said, however, that he is  going to start pressing charges  against protesters as a way to intimidate them into thinking twice about demonstrating at his rallies.Based on the change to H.R. 347 in 2012, he may have grounds to press for trespassing charges against any protester who walked into the rally knowing it was a restricted area, according to the ACLU.

        "text": "ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES:Three Russian billionaires are hitting back after they say they were defamed by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The Russians  lawsuit says the dossier s assertions  falsely accuse  the three and Alfa  of criminal conduct and alleged cooperation with the  Kremlin  to influence the 2016 presidential election.  It says Fusion recklessly spread the charges to journalists.FUSION GPS FEELS THE KARMA:Fusion GPS, the producer of the infamous fake Trump dossier, is fending off in court three of Russia s richest oligarchs by painting them as corrupt bankers in bed with President Vladimir Putin.The three primary investors in Moscow s Alfa Bank   Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and German Khan   filed a libel lawsuit against Fusion in October. Fusion s dossier, written by former British spy Christopher Steele, says two of them engineered cash bribes to Mr. Putin. The dossier also implies that the bank colluded with Mr. Putin to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic Party computers.The lawsuit describes the three billionaires as international businessmen who became  collateral damage  in Fusion s war to destroy the Donald Trump campaign. This is a defamation case brought by three international businessmen who were defamed in widely disseminated political research reports commissioned by political opponents of candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election cycle,  says a Dec. 12 filing in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The reports are gravely damaging in that, directly or by implication, they falsely accuse the plaintiffs   and Alfa, a consortium in which the plaintiffs are investors   of criminal conduct and alleged cooperation with  Kremlin  to influence the 2016 presidential election,  says the complaint by the New York law firm Carter Ledyard & Milburn.Fusion responded in court by relying on Wikipedia and its press citations to paint a dark picture of three oligarchs who, the media say, capitalized on Russia s freewheeling post-communism era to engage in financial scandals. Fusion depicted the three as publicity-seeking financial titans who are public figures under U.S. law.Unlike private citizens, public figures face a high bar in libel lawsuits. In this case, the Russian businessmen, if deemed public figures, must prove that Fusion spread the dossier charges with malice   meaning the opposition research firm knew its accusations were untrue or showed reckless disregard for the truth.THREE BILLIONAIRES: Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and German Khan are three of the most prominent oligarchs in Russian history,  the Fusion memo states.  With their incredible wealth and political power, each has had a pronounced influence on the economic and political affairs of Russia.   Any search returns an avalanche of articles about their business endeavors, their wealth, their political and economic power, their close relationship with the Kremlin and their misconduct. At issue is Mr. Steele s September 2016 writings devoted to Alfa (which he wrongly spells Alpha), one of 17 memos making up the dossier from June to December 2016.He states that the Alfa Bank paid  illicit cash  directly from Mr. Fridman and Mr. Aven to Mr. Putin via Oleg Govorun, now a senior Kremlin figure,  throughout the 1990s. Mr. Govorun s official resume states that he was an executive for Alfa only from 1997 to 2000.Mr. Steele titled the September memo,  Presidential Election: Kremlin-Alpha Group Co-Operation.

Hillary would have been too boring, I suppose. It s the worst thing that s ever happened. It s the worst. This guy is going to destroy civilization as we know it, and the earth, and all because of these people who don t have any idea why they re alive.Now that s the perfect angry rant about Trump and his supporters that we ve been waiting for.And he is right.For a year and a half, Trump has used offensive and divisive rhetoric that should have disqualified him from seeking the presidency on day one of his campaign. His racism and sexism and ignorance should have lost him the election by a landslide. But he won anyway because stupid people voted for him because they want nothing more than to watch the world burn.Featured Image: Wikimedia",

        "text": "Sarah Palin has said a lot of stupid things over the years but she definitely defended her America s village idiot crown with this one.The New York Times is looking to cut costs by vacating eight floors at their current headquarters to generate rental revenue and create a better work environment. Of course, conservative media is gloating about this by claiming that the newspaper is  broke  and will be laying off  hundreds of employees.  But it appears that the New York Times is simply restructuring and the moves will only affect a handful of jobs for the time being if any at all. Meanwhile, the publisher and CEO are giving up corner offices, which will save more money to keep more employees. So the plan is displacing everyone on those floors no matter what position they hold in the company.And so Sarah Palin decided to brag about the New York Times supposedly going  broke  (citing a right-wing website that profits on fake news and can t even bother to check their headlines for typos) by posting about it on Twitter, massacring lyrics from a popular Jamie Foxx and Kanye West song from 2005 in the process.NYT: I ain t saying you a golddigger, but there s a reason you messin  with broke, broke, broke. https://t.co/PYkWNyyx9k  Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) December 19, 2016Seriously, that does not make any sense.

        "text": "In typical Obama fashion, the extravagant tax-payer funded Nordic state dinner looked more like an after-party for the Academy Awards than a state function. How is anyone supposed to take this ass-clown seriously when he has turned our White House into a playground for the  who s who  in the Hollywood Communist party? But then again, nothing Obama does is for the good of our country, it always has been, and will continue to be, all about him until he and his sorry excuse for a family exit the White House. I m sure the sight of pop singer Demi Lovato and comedian Aziz Ansar with Nordic leaders at the White House left Putin shaking in his boots President Obama and the First Lady have welcomed five Nordic leaders to the White House for a lavish state dinner after earlier putting on a show of unity against Vladimir Putin s recent military aggression in the Baltics.The Obamas first welcomed Icelandic Prime Minister Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson   who has only been in charge of his country for a month   and his wife Ingibjorg Elsa Ingjaldsdottir as they arrived at the North Portico of the White House.They were swiftly followed by the prime ministers of Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway, who were also invited to the unusual   if a little crowded   meeting.The dinner will send a strong statement to Russia, who the five heads of state earlier slammed for its military buildup   including the buzzing of a U.S. warship near Kaliningrad   as they called for economic sanctions against Moscow to be maintained.Here s a peak into the Academy Awards after party Nordic State dinner. True to our divisive President s nature, there wasn t a single Republican invited to the affair.More than 300 guests   including actor Will Ferrell, David Letterman and former NBA star Alonzo Mourning   were invited to the dinner.Ferrell, who attended the dinner with his Swedish wife, Vivica Paulin, said it was his first time at the White House.  I hope we don t do anything wrong,  he joked.Also expected are Girls actress Allison Williams, Scandal star Bellamy Young, singer Janelle Monae and former Victoria s Secret model Miranda Kerr, as well as a smattering of Nordic celebrities. Several Democratic lawmakers were on the guest list, but no Republicans   a possible sign that Obama s efforts to win over his political rivals are waning as the end of his presidency nears.Via: Daily Mail",

        "text": "The answer is anyone but YOU. Did you know that American taxpayers gave the U.N. general fund $654,778,938 in 2015? Did you also know that Obama committed an astounding $3 billion to a new U.N. Climate fund run by communist and terrorist nations. It gets better, we just gave Africa $36.5 million to train African doctors because the World Health Organization deemed it necessary. The NIH then gives the $36.5 million in American money to whomever the WHO wants it given to. Do you see how this works? The National Institutes of Health is a virtual slush fund for anyone and everyone in the world with a massive budget of $30 BILLION.  The system of giving is a perfect setup for the REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH from the West. I ve heard different pundits call for the defunding of the National Institutes of Health and it s evident they re not being monitored. How do I know this? All you need to do is go to their website or read the news and you ll be shocked at the  ridiculous studies they fund with YOUR MONEY! Like the one where they got monkeys drunk:GOLDEN HAMMER: FEDS SPEND MILLIONS TO STUDY DRUNKEN MONEYS, PILOTS AND STUDENTSIt ll make your head explode! Like a good lap dog, the U.S. is dedicating $36.5 million to help Africa train doctors because the famously corrupt United Nations determined that the continent has a terrible shortage of medical personnel and faculty.That means Uncle Sam must come to the rescue. The latest Africa allocation is in addition to the eye-popping $654,778,938 that American taxpayers gave the U.N. general fund in 2015 and billions more to the peacekeeping budget and other U.N. organizations. The U.S. has always been the single largest contributor to the world body, which is well known as a pillar of fraud and mismanagement. Even the U.N. s Human Rights Council, also funded primarily by American taxpayers, is a huge joke. A few years ago Judicial Watch reported that the U.N. awarded a genocidal warlord indicted by an international court for crimes against humanity a seat on its laughable human rights council. Last year President Obama committed an astounding $3 billion to a new U.N. Climate fund run by communist and terrorist nations.Now the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.N. s public health arm, has determined that sub-Saharan Africa is in desperate need of medical personnel. The region bears almost a quarter of the global disease burden yet has only 3% of the world s health workforce, according to WHO. So this week, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the nation s medical research agency, kicked in the $36.5 million to train Africans. The NIH doles out north of $31 billion annually to hundreds of thousands of researchers at thousands of universities and institutions around the globe. A few years ago President Obama launched an NIH program to boost the number of minorities in biomedical research and he appointed the nation s first ever Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity to mastermind a multi-million-dollar effort.The new Africa allocation will help the region strengthen medical school curricula, upgrade community-based training sites and expand communications technology, according to an NIH announcement.  Research must play an integral part in generating sustainable, quality health care in sub-Saharan Africa, which is the ultimate goal,  NIH Director Francis Collins said.  It is critical that we increase research capacity so Africans can carry out locally relevant investigations themselves, and develop the necessary expertise in areas such as bioethics, informatics, environmental science, and genomics. That will empower their participation in international collaborations. Read more: JW ",

        "text": "Saturday Night Live is back with new episodes, and this week s cold open did not disappoint. As the iconic show went live coast-to-coast for the first time in history, they went all in on the incompetence of The Donald s reality show  presidency.   Alec Baldwin returned as the reliably buffoonish Trump, and Jimmy Fallon played the notoriously silent son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kusher. To round off the spoof, the Grim Reaper returned as the newly diminished Steve Bannon. There was even a cameo by  Mike Pence,  played by Beck Bennett, where the show ruthlessly mocked reports that Pence actually calls his wife  mother. In the spoof, Baldwin s Trump is doing a reality-show style elimination round to finally end the Kushner vs. Bannon feud that has been irritating him and amusing the rest of us for weeks now. He starts out by saying that he is holding a photo of each adviser, and only one will get to stay.  Trump  praises  Kushner  for being photogenic, while telling  Bannon  that pictures of him make him want to puke. In the end, Kushner is chosen, and another Grim Reaper-like figure comes to take  Bannon  to hell. After that, SNL kicked off what is sure to be a successful  President Kushner  narrative, as they have  Trump  tell  Kushner  to sit at the president s desk in the Oval Office, while  Trump  himself returns to the child s desk to play with his toys, just as he did in previous episodes with  President Bannon. All in all, SNL outdid themselves with this one. There are no words to describe how funny this is.Watch below for the most hilarious few minutes of your evening:Featured image via video screen capture",

        "text": "When asked by the other hosts on the show,  Where would you go?  Whoopie pauses, then realizes there really is no better country on the earth, as she sheepishly replies,  I don t know, I ve always been in America.  There s usually a good reason that people don t give up their citizenship Whoopie. There s probably a reason so many people are willing to break the law and illegally enter our country. Despite the drivel you and your cohorts push on  The View,  every American doesn t believe they re somehow a victim, and most Americans agree with Trump that we shouldn t be willing to give up all that makes America great just because the Left wants to shore up their voting block. If you wanna know what is really getting under Whoopie s skin, it s the idea that no one in the media can control Trump. That s what s really got the girls on  The View  freaking out Wednesday on ABC s  The View,  co-host Whoopi Goldberg said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump needs to  stop blaming  others for the problems in America and threatened to  move  out of the country.https://youtu.be/NwE2ZvcpKUsGoldberg said,  People don t like being the butt of the jokes and now that people say, listen, you can t make me the butt of your jokes, I don t like it. You can t use me as some sort of stereotype. I don t like it. That s the PC people are talking about. And the bottom line is this find a different way to say what you re going to say. People are not going to take it anymore. So if that s what s pisses you off, you re going to stay angry. Co-host Joy Behar said,  A lot of it has to do with their pocketbook. They re not making as much money as they used to make, that particular group of people. Maybe jobs are overseas, maybe technology has taken over, they don t have the background for it. They re ticked off. Goldberg interjected,  But then you can t blame immigrants for that. Behar continued,  That s scapegoating. It s as old as the hills. What do you think World War II is all about? You know that. It s all about blaming the Jews. Now it s the Mexicans and the Muslims. Blame everybody but yourself. Later in the segment, Goldberg continued her rant. Listen, he can be whatever party he wants to be,  she said.  What he can t be is he can t be the guy that says it s your fault stuff isn t working. That s not the president I want. Find a way to make stuff work. Stop blaming everybody because all of this, as American citizens, this is our   we did all of this. We ve allowed all this stuff, so we have to fix it. But you can t say,  Oh, you re Lebanese or you re black or you re Mexican or you re a woman.  Stop blaming everybody. Let s fix the crap. Let s just fix it. If you can fix it, I will listen to what you have to say. The minute you start pointing and saying that person is a rapist and a murderer, it pisses me off because I ve been part of that when they just use a blanket statement to talk about black people or when they use a blanket statement to talk about white people or women or any other group. I don t think that s America. I don t want it to be America. Maybe it s time for me to move, you know. I can afford to go,  she added.  I ve always been an American, and this has always been my country and we ve always been able to have discussions. And suddenly now it s turning into, you know, not them, not them. And you know, we have a lot of friends whose parents saw this already. They don t want to relive this   So I need all the candidates to get it together. Get back to American values. Behar said,  I must be naive maybe but I do believe that at the end of the day the American people will not vote for that type of xenophobia. The fact that they voted twice for President Obama, twice for President Clinton, people like that. I really do believe they will come to their senses. You know what, he can t win without 40 percent of the Hispanic vote and he has alienated the Hispanics. Via: Breitbart News",

        "title": " Three Key States Turn Themselves SOLIDLY Blue As Trump Train Derails",
        "text": "The clusterfuck that is Donald Trump s campaign is manifesting itself in the polls, as Hillary first opens up a ten-point lead nationally, and now, gains huge leads in three major battleground states. New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Michigan have all pivoted solidly toward Hillary, at least for now, when she and Trump were virtually deadlocked before the Trump Train went off the tracks.Perhaps one of the most surprising aspects of these polls is that western Michigan, which tends to be very Republican, has turned blue because of Trump s downward spiral. Hillary now has a nine-point lead in that state, along with an 11-point lead in Pennsylvania and a whopping 17-point lead in New Hampshire.Past polls showed Hillary within just a few points of Trump in all three states, setting the stage for a major showdown in the battlegrounds. Normally, that would likely continue   there s a reason these states are battlegrounds.The Trump Train is anything but a normal campaign, though. Richard Czuba, president of the Glengariff Group, Inc., says: He s sitting in the cellar right now, and they re going to have to do something to dramatically turn this around.If I were a Republican running on this ticket right now, I d be beyond nervous. Some of them are. There are Republicans running for re-election to Congress who have said that they can t support him. A Republican strategist actually said that not endorsing Trump is a badge of honor, instead of the horrible betrayal and kiss of death it would ordinarily be. Billionaire Meg Whitman, who votes for Republicans in presidential elections, has formally endorsed Hillary Clinton.Perhaps even more damning for Trump are conflicting reports about the state of his campaign. His campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his spokespeople say that everything is fine. One of his spokespeople even said that Trump s success is evident in the crowds he draws, the ratings he garners, and his fundraising. All of that implies that he thinks the polls are badly biased (isn t everything biased in Trumpland?).But an ally to Manafort said that even Manafort is ready to give up, and staff morale is virtually nil. That conflict further damages Trump as he struggles to convince America that he hasn t completely lost it.Speaking to that, GOP strategist Greg McNeilly says: I know that there s a lot of numbers that matter in politics, but Twitter followers still don t trump poll numbers. He said that Trump should stick to his  Make America great again  messaging. Trump doesn t know how, though, because he s Donald Trump and Donald Trump knows best, including when it comes to vanquishing his enemies, real and imagined. John Harwood, of CNBC, confirmed that when he said that Trump s campaign is unique because candidates don t usually have a stranglehold on their campaign s daily messaging. Trump, as a thin-skinned control freak, does.And that s how Trump likes it, so the GOP better get used to it. They nominated this train wreck. They get to handle the fallout right up until we go to the polls in November.Featured image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",

        "text": "Obama urged Indonesians on Saturday to resist divisive politics based on race and religion It was REALLY just another swipe at Trump. He s done this fear mongering over and over before (see video below from 2016) and he s doing it again by taking a veiled swipe at President Trump during his visit to Indonesia: *FYI-He gave the same BS speech on 9/11, 1/13, 6/16, 11/16   ANOTHER FYI   This has been the mantra of the Obamas for years! Check out Monica Crowley s take below. She calls out these political grifters who always PROJECT wrongdoing on others. Aren t THEY the ones who are guilty of the very thing they re claiming someone else is doing?CHECK THIS TOTAL BS OUT: I love that for Barack, there is no such thing as  us  and  them    he doesn t care whether you re a Democrat, a Republican, or none of the above. He knows that we all love our country. And he s always ready to listen to good ideas. He s always looking for the very best in everyone he meets.    Michelle Obama The Guardian reported:The former US president said some countries had adopted  an aggressive kind of nationalism  and  increased resentment of minority groups , in a speech in Indonesia on Saturday that could be seen as a commentary on the US as well as Indonesia.Obama, who was on a personal visit to the country where he spent some of his childhood, said the Muslim community in Indonesia had historically protected Hindu and Buddhist temples. Indonesia is made of thousands of islands, hundreds of languages, scores of regions and ethnic groups. So my time here made me cherish and respect for people s differences,  he told a packed audience in Jakarta.Obama stopped short of mentioning any specific cases of racial or religious intolerance. It is very important here in Indonesia, the United States, Europe, everywhere, to fight against the politics of  us and them ,  he said to cheers from thousands of mostly Indonesians who have worked or studied abroad.He arrived in Jakarta after visiting the cultural city of Yogyakarta and white-water rafting on the tourist island of Bali. He also met Indonesian President Joko Widodo in Bogor, south of the capital.Indonesia, a country of 250 million people, has experienced rising intolerance against non-Muslims and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.A leader of Indonesia s second-largest Muslim organization this week called for a boycott of Starbucks, saying that the international coffee chain s pro-gay stand risks ruining the  religious and cultured  core of the country.MONICA CROWLEY CALLED THE OBAMAS OUT WHEN MICHELLE GAVE A SPEECH REFERRING TO BARACK S  US vs THEM  Mantra:Last night, Michelle Obama took the stage and delivered a speech meant to rally the Democratic faithful and to humanize her husband. After nearly four years of his presidency, it does seem odd that she still has to humanize him. That s usually something that more unknown challengers must do. But the perception of Obama as an aloof, distant, egotistical narcissist has been growing, so Michelle was dispatched to paint a warmer picture of him. If Team Obama is worried about THAT at this late hour as well as worrying about their base they know they re in trouble.For what it was, Michelle s speech was solid, and she certainly knows how to deliver. It was a home run, the same way Ann Romney s speech was a home run last week. But one short paragraph has become the definitive theme of the speech, because it rings so outrageously false. She said,  I love that for Barack, there is no such thing as  us  and  them    he doesn t care whether you re a Democrat, a Republican, or none of the above. He knows that we all love our country. And he s always ready to listen to good ideas. He s always looking for the very best in everyone he meets. The ONLY thing Obama has done since taking office is divide on the basis of  us  vs.  them.  He and his team have divided Americans by class (by incessantly slamming the  1%,   millionaires and billionaires,  commanding them to do their  fair share,  etc).He has divided by race (see Joe Biden s recent comment,  They re gonna put y all back in chains ).He has divided by age (attempting to scare seniors by falsely and dishonestly suggesting that the Republicans  Medicare reforms would toss grandma off the cliff, and by giving away the store to college kids on student loans).And he has divided by gender (ginning up a completely bogus GOP  war on women. )As far as Michelle s comment that Obama  doesn t care whether you re a Democrat, a Republican, or none of the above,  and  he s always ready to listen to good ideas ,  Obama hasn t met with the GOP in over a year, scolded them on Day One of his presidency with  I won,  told a Democrat who had voted against the stimulus,  Don t think we re not keeping score, brother,  and once referred to  punishing our enemies.  Not exactly the warm n  fuzzy Barack Michelle was desperately trying to paint.And as far as  listening to good ideas,  he blew off his own deficit reduction commission, Simpson-Bowles, as well as Paul Ryan s budget reform ideas and disregarded moderate Democrats  ideas to carry out health reform more slowly and with GOP buy-in (see: defeated Arkansas Senator Blanche Lincoln and her pleas to Obama, which fell on deaf ears).So: Michelle can try all she wants to resurrect Obama s 2004 image of a guy who said  there s not a red America or a blue America,  and she and other Democrats can try to invoke his 2008 image of the transcendent guy sitting above petty politicking and business-as-usual. But after nearly four years of division, distraction, and destruction, not many people are buying that sales pitch anymore. It s old, it s tired, and like his radical redistributionism, it s done.",

        "text": "Ever since we ve heard the news of Donald Trump and his  publicist  John Miller, a character he seemingly created to brag about himself, pretty much anyone and everyone has been making fun of him for it, because it s pretty damn hilarious.Making an appearance on The View,  comedian and television host Jimmy Kimmel was no exception. He, alongside the ladies of The View took Trump to task sarcastically and brilliantly bringing the real estate mogul down a few pegs.After Whoopi Goldberg asks Kimmel about the allegations surrounding Trump posing as his own publicist, Kimmel said: If Trump says that wasn t him, we have no choice but to believe him. He s never lied to us before. You could see and feel the sarcasm oozing out of the television.Kimmel adds: It s clearly him. He then suggests that Trump should just admit it was him and say it was a prank call.When asked why Trump would do such a thing and then deny it, Kimmel explained he s probably incredibly embarrassed. Why would he lie about it? Listen, if you were calling People magazine and telling them all the women that wanted to have sex with you, I think you would be embarrassed about it too, right? Kimmel also states that Madonna was allegedly one of the women, and that as vice president this is one of the big questions he will tackle.The worst part about all of this, is that this is clearly is a distraction away from the fact that Trump has no actual policy plans and isn t at all qualified for the job of Commander-in-Chief. A fact that needs to be discussed far more often.Watch the interview here:What does @JimmyKimmel have to say about Trump denying he s his own publicist?  He s never lied to us before!  https://t.co/sC9ioe1l4t  The View (@TheView) May 16, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",

        "text": "President-elect Donald J. Trump s transition staff has issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day, according to several American diplomats familiar with the plan, breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods.The mandate   issued  without exceptions,  according to a terse State Department cable sent on Dec. 23, diplomats who saw it said   threatens to leave the United States without Senate-confirmed envoys for months in critical nations like Germany, Canada and Britain. In the past, administrations of both parties have often granted extensions on a case-by-case basis to allow a handful of ambassadors, particularly those with school-age children, to remain in place for weeks or months.Mr. Trump, by contrast, has taken a hard line against leaving any of President Obama s political appointees in place as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20 with a mission of dismantling many of his predecessor s signature foreign and domestic policy achievements.  Political  ambassadors, many of them major donors who are nominated by virtue of close ties with the president, almost always leave at the end of his term; ambassadors who are career diplomats often remain in their posts.A senior Trump transition official said there was no ill will in the move, describing it as a simple matter of ensuring that Mr. Obama s overseas appointees leave the government on schedule, just as thousands of political aides at the White House and in federal agencies must do. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal deliberations, said the ambassadors should not be surprised about being held to a hard end date.   NYT s",

        "text": "Donald Trump treated Americans who oppose him as the enemy on Saturday and delivered the most divisive speech ever given by a president.Rather than attend the White House Correspondents  Dinner, Trump skipped the event instead to hold a rally in Pennsylvania where he displayed the kind of pettiness and divisiveness that are unprecedented in presidential history. It s time for all of us to remember that we are one people with one great American destiny, and that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, and we all share the same glorious freedoms of our magnificent country,  Trump said, suggesting that Americans who oppose him are not patriots.Trump also bragged about the size of his crowd, despite the fact that it was not a  record,  and bragged about his  achievements  in his first 100 days even though he has been a complete failure who has done nothing but sign tyrannical executive orders and play golf while having no major legislation reach the Oval Office desk.Indeed, Trump s attempt to repeal the popular Affordable Care Act failed spectacularly and his executive orders on immigration have been blocked by the courts.Trump also treated a protester like shit at the rally, ordering security to  get him out of here,  as Nazis stood by in approval.Trump speech was not presidential. It was meant strictly to pander to his vile base of deplorable supporters who still supoort him no matter how much he lies or how much he destroys our country.And David Gergen, who served as an adviser to Nixon, Ford, and Reagan, trashed Trump s  disturbing  speech. This was the most divisive speech I have ever heard from a sitting American president,  Gergen said.  Others may disagree about that. He played to his base and he treated his other listeners, the rest of the people who have been disturbed about him or opposed him, he treated them basically as,  I don t give a damn what you think because you re frankly like the enemy.  I thought it was a deeply disturbing speech. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump should be impeached and everything he has done should be reversed and erased as if he never held office. He should also be put in prison for colluding with Russia, attempting to sabotage the United States, and violating the Constitution. Acting like a hateful and vengeful dictator should not be tolerated in this country.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",

Some nations have even kissed Trump s ass, which pissed off Irish Senator Aodh n O Riord in to the point where he ripped his government for sucking up to a fascist. America has just elected a fascist and the best thing that the good people in Ireland can do is to ring him up and ask him, is it OK to still bring the shamrock on Saint Patrick s Day? I am embarrassed by the reaction of the Irish government to what has happened in America. I can t believe the reaction from An Taoiseach and from the government. O Riord in then went on a tear listing some of the aspects of fascism. I don t use the term fascist lightly. What else would you call someone who threatens to imprison his political opponents. What else would you call somebody who threatens to not allow people of a certain political faith into their country. What would you say, or what would you call somebody who was threatening to deport 10 million people. He also warned his government that right-wing extremism is rising across Europe and the United States. Can the government not understand what s happening? We are at an ugly international crossroads. What s happening in Britain is appalling. What s happening across Europe is appalling. It has echoes from the 1930s. And America, the most powerful country in the world, has just elected a fascist! He then called for the Minister of Foreign Affairs to explain how Ireland intends to deal with  monster  Trump and said Ireland s support should be conditional like Germany s. Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and dignity of man,  Angela Merkel said in a message to Trump.  Independent of origin, skin-color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views. I offer the next president of the United States close cooperation on the basis of these values. Here s the video via The Irish Independent.Donald Trump and the Republican Party are the enemies of everything that is good in this world. Trump has no right to call for unity when he spent a year and a half dividing Americans with hate, ignorance, fear, racism, and sexism.

        "text": "Footage has been released of a leader of the Republican National Committee ranting for a full five minutes about the need for a rebellion against Presidential candidates like Donald Trump. The video serves as evidence that it s not just liberals who know that conservatives are going to lose in 2016 with extremists like Trump on the ticket.The star of the footage   Holland Redfield, who represents the U.S. Virgin Islands   uses some rather colorful language in his incitement against the likes of trust fund tycoon Donald Trump. If I didn t say this, I d go home very troubled.  Redfield tells the audience of the private, RNC Winter Meeting. When we have allowed the party to be representing a tremendous amount of anger we are playing a very dangerous game.Does the tail wag the dog, or does the dog wag the tail? He rails against the gutter-level language being used by candidates like Trump and others, and the  disrespect  for ethnic minorities which risks making the party unelectable to Americans who aren t white. Not only is this morally reprehensible, but it s electoral suicide in a rainbow nation.And what happens when a party member voices concerns about these issues? Redfield argues that  we re almost terrorized as members of our party.  Shut up. Toe the line, embrace each other, and let s go forward. Redfield refuses to name Trump because he fears:  I will be targeted. It is likely Redfield speaks for a sea of moderate conservatives across the United States who cease to feel represented by a party which has been seized by Christian and right-wing extremists. These moderate conservatives might well be forced into the position of voting Democrat in 2016, or abstaining altogether, with the absence of a GOP candidate who speaks to their vision of America. The Eisenhower Republicans, who aren t afraid to invest public money to make America a world leader in education, science, technology and engineering; who would rather the U.S. spent a little less on engaging in permanent war overseas, and a little more on roads, schools, and hospitals at home. How could they ever vote for a Trump, or a Ted Cruz?This video of this desperate plea for a new direction by this lone RNC leader speaks to the bigger crisis for conservatives in America. The religious right has pulled the entire party off it s axis, and is speaking to an ever smaller, echo chamber of extreme conservatism. In doing so, they are doing the job of putting a Democrat in the White House in 2016 all by themselves.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons",

        "title": "LOW FLUSH TOILETS, DELTA SMELT, PAYOFFS, NEIGHBORHOOD SNITCHES AND STATISTS\u2026Why The Radical Left Is Lying About A Water Crisis In CA",
        "text": "Dr. Gina Loudon is hands down one of our favorite conservative writers. She nails it with this piece about the truth behind the lies of the California drought I found it supremely ironic this week that two of the big stories were about a man-made lack of water in California, and a man lost in a vast sea off of Florida.Gov. Jerry  Moonbeam  Brown announced the dire circumstances, not from the Capitol in Sacramento, but from the dramatic backdrop of a mountaintop. His narrative held that there should be five feet of  snow pack,  but alas, there was none. Brown, and the radical Marxists, couched as  environmentalists  he represents, have convinced most Americans to hold two radically opposing views simultaneously. Ostensibly, California is in danger of being flooded by rising sea levels caused by global warming and melting polar ice caps, and it is also utterly out of water.There is no shortage of water. This is an environmentalist-created drought that is costing billions.I waver between utter disgust and admiration when I watch how the leftists sell these things, always with straight faces. Every major news outlet in America and many around the world swallowed the narrative like fish on a baited hook. They tell us there is no water, no snow to provide water for the summer, and the farmers are taking too much so people must suffer. There is an all-out war on grass, and no one is safe. Sorry, Shaggy, your  grass  is to blame as well.There is hand wringing in every club house as the boards are told they are coming for the rough grass, your fairways and greens are safe, for now. Evil rich guys in colorful knickers and almond farmers in overalls are the scourge of California. Off with their heads! Oh, and you can forget about the luxury of children playing on the lawn. If you want that, you breeders should move to flyover land! Don t you dare sneak and water the backyard after dark; Brown makes it easy for your neighbors to snitch on you. I m not making this up. They really have a state hotline for that.Those of us who pay attention know well the proverb,  Where there is no vision, the people perish.  The people who built California into the greatest agricultural producer in America gave us dams, canals, reservoirs and all kinds of conveyance of water. They harnessed the rivers that reach from the Pacific Northwest down well into Northern California and even draw water to the Golden State from the Colorado River. That was then. Nothing has changed since then, except political power.For the last several decades, the radical fringe has taken full control of California, and it hates people. Dennis Prager observed that statists love humanity but hate humans. Watch how they latch onto dreams of egalitarian states but begin the execution of their plans by marginalizing, isolating and then executing anyone who disagrees with them. They dine in the finest restaurants in San Francisco, the likes of Brown, Pelosi, Boxer and Feinstein, planning lawsuits to cut the flow of water to the farms of Central California and the people in Southern California, caring not a wit that 40,000 agricultural workers, mostly Hispanic, are unemployed.Just this week, in the middle of a human crisis, federal fish agents ordered the release of billions of gallons of water purportedly to save six fish. You read that right. Not to save six species of fish, but literally, six fish. Apparently, these special six stood their, err ground, and when 29 of their compadres rode the 10 billion gallon man-made wave to the ocean in March, they refused to go with the flow (sorry).You can t make this stuff up. But when you do, people actually believe it.So Obama administration agents want a second toilet flush to give these hard-headed steelheads a second nudge. The idea that nature itself may be holding the fish where they are is of no concern to statists who love telling both man and beast what they think is good for them. Sadly, this latest mind-boggling atrocity is getting very little media coverage. I found excellent coverage in the Manteca Bulletin. Why hasn t the Los Angeles Times reported on this?The current shortage is based primarily on the release of billions of gallons daily into the San Francisco Bay to sustain the bait fish known as the Delta smelt. This is a simple distribution issue; there is plenty of water.Prior to the statists taking over California, massive pumps were diverting water from rivers into the canal system (built before Brown and his ilk took control of the state). They have all but turned these pumps off to protect the fish from their Darwinian demise, and billions upon billions of gallons of fresh water is continuously dumped into the ocean.For the people-hating San Francisco cabal, cutting off water from the people is the real goal. They want fewer people to begin with, but the ultimate goal is control. Few environmentalists admit it publicly, but they want zero farming in the central valley, preferring to  allow  land to return to its prehistoric state. The cabal wants to control water so they can control people. Brown is just the messenger today. He is telling America that water access is a privilege, he has the power to pick winners and losers, and we have to just take it.If Brown decides tomorrow that he wants to withhold water from almond farmers, Americans will just have to accept it. Have you ever wondered why any business owner would give campaign donations to Marxist, business-hating politicians? Now you know why. They must give to buy protection. Business owners do not donate to Brown, Pelosi or Harry Reid because those politicians are good for business; they give to be sure they are not the next targets.The problem with all of this is that water is a limitless natural resource. Just ask the sailor who faced drowning daily or the people in the Midwest who were deluged this week. It is one thing to argue for conservation of animals, or even trees, or  green space,  but water? Water is a limitless natural resource. Not even the most self-important leftist believes he could make water go away, no matter how hard he tried. How did they convince us to accept this lie?They got us to buy the lie that water is scarce by telling it often enough and pounding it into generations of schoolchildren. Using federal law and acts of Congress, they forced people from water-soaked regions to accept low flush or what some call  two flush  toilets the same as desert-dwelling Californians. And we fell for it. At least the Democrats among us fell for it.Thus it is that Brown got to have his cake and eat it, too. He told Californians, and really all Americans and the world, that lack of water was not his fault for lacking the vision to feed the distribution system created by the real men who built California. He repeats that it is not the fault of the Marxists  Endangered Species Act that prefers hard-headed fish over people. The lack of water is the result of the lack of  snow pack,  which is the result of  climate change,  which is the result of greedy people being well, people. The Delta smelt and steelhead trout must live and we mere humans should all just die.Meanwhile, Jerry Brown is committed to spending $100 billion for trains, but he has made zero commitment to allowing water to flow to people instead of fish, and zero commitment to finding funding for his  twin tunnels  alternate solution. And why would he? We are cutting back our water use, ratting on our neighbors and accepting higher produce prices across America. The Marxists in San Francisco are toasting total victory. The farmers and country club board members are suing for peace. Lord help usVia: WND",

        "text": "After months of lying about passing debate questions to Hillary before the presidential debate that was hosted by her employer, CNN, the former DNC Chair Donna Brazile, finally came clean. During an interview with Trevor Noah of the Daily Show, Brazile arrogantly excused her dishonest behavior by telling Noah: Well, first of all, I didn t have my hands in the cookie jar. I m an operative, I m a strategist, and part of what my role was, in addition to being a  political pundit,  was to help advance the cause of justice and equality Today s a new day, however, and Donna Brazile has decided to emerge from the shadows to promote her new bombshell, tell-all book that is sure to ruffle a few feathers in the Democrat Party Her book is about the chaos at the DNC during the 2016 campaign. On Thursday, she revealed a section of it at Politico. What emerges from the excerpt is a picture of Brazile as a heroine (of course), Hillary Clinton as the villainess, Debbie Wasserman Schultz as incompetent and lazy, and Barack Obama as the unnamed cancer that ate away at the center of the party.Ouch.In Brazile s book, she claims that Obama cleaned out the Party. Brazile writes that by the time she took over, the Democratic Party was  broke and $2 million in debt.  According to Brazile, Obama  left the party $24 million in debt    hey, sort of like the country!   and his campaign wouldn t pay off that debt until election year. Furthermore, Wasserman Schultz had grown staff and allowed the DNC to pick up the check for Obama consultants.Brazile also claims that Hillary ran the Party. Hillary used that debt to pick up power   they pledged to fill in the funding gap for the DNC so long as they got to run operations. Gary Gensler, CFO of the Hillary campaign, apparently  described the party as fully under the control of Hillary s campaign, which seemed to confirm the suspicions of the Bernie camp. The campaign had the DNC on life support, giving it money every month to meet its basic expenses, while the campaign was using the party as a fund-raising clearinghouse. Hillary Essentially Laundered Campaign Money Through The DNC. Hillary raised an enormous amount of money for the DNC, but virtually all that money went to Hillary s campaign. Less than half of 1 percent of all money Hillary raised from her fundraisers went to the states. Brazile explains:When the Politico story described this arrangement as  essentially   money laundering  for the Clinton campaign, Hillary s people were outraged at being accused of doing something shady. Bernie s people were angry for their own reasons, saying this was part of a calculated strategy to throw the nomination to Hillary.The party ran as an adjunct to the Hillary campaign long before the primaries, meaning that Bernie was at a severe disadvantage. Brazile admits as much:The funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical. If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead.For entire story: Daily Wire ",

She s a great girl. And we re protecting them well,  Trump told PEOPLE at a benefit honoring Australia director Baz Luhrman at the Museum of Modern Art Monday night.  They are very safe. PeopleIn 2008, Hudson performed  Let s Stay Together  for Barack and Michelle Obama during Obama s inauguration ball. It s not clear if Obama and Michelle did anything to help her after her family was murdered.Two days ago, another  Dream Girls  star, Broadway sensation Jennifer Holliday, who had previously committed to performing at Trump s inauguration, backed out over bullying and threats she received from the Left.Ms. Holliday said she was asked on Wednesday if she would sing at the concert scheduled for Jan. 19, and she agreed, seeing the request as similar to those she received to sing at the White House during past Republican and Democratic presidencies.  I just thought of the history part of it, and about singing on the mall where Marian Anderson paved the way for me to sing as a black American,  she said, referring to a 1939 concert that Ms. Anderson, a popular singer, performed from the Lincoln Memorial after being denied permission to sing at Constitution Hall because she was black.Ms. Holliday said she had been startled and disheartened on Friday by the venom that greeted the news of her participation. It brought a lot of threats from people already saying I ll never work again,  she said.  If that s what America has come to, where we all hate and bully people, there s no more freedom of speech. She added,  I know everybody hates me now, but that shows we are all just hateful people now   we don t even want to work together. Ms. Holliday said she did not see herself, or her singing, as political, a sentiment echoed by Jackie Evancho, the 16-year-old classical-crossover singer who will perform the national anthem at Mr. Trump s inauguration on Jan. 20. I just kind of thought that this is for my country,  Ms. Evancho said.  So if people are going to hate on me it s for the wrong reason. Ms. Holliday said her goal is to support America:  Are we saying that if there is anything that could be done for America in four or eight years or however long Trump is there, we re not supposed to participate or help anybody?  she asked.  Shouldn t we all be praying for the success of America? I would like to sing some hope and have my voice not be associated with some kind of label, but I guess that s where we are now.   NYT s ",

        "text": "Despite all efforts to stop this from happening, Donald Trump  cruised to victory  today in the Electoral College, according to the Associated Press. Now, unless something really bizarre happens when Congress certifies the vote, Trump is officially the 45th President of the United States.Iowa s electors cast all six of their votes for Trump, Montana cast all three of theirs for Trump, Michigan cast its 16 for Trump and Florida its 19, and Missouri and Arizona put him up to 245 when their votes came in.It was apparently Texas that put Trump over the 270-vote threshold. Texas said earlier today that they might replace three electors who supposedly were ineligible to hold federal jobs, and there was a fourth who resigned. Election officials would have made sure that any replacements made would be solidly in Trump s camp, and that s exactly what happened.Other than that, though, there was little sign of defection from Republicans, even though there were people who insisted that as many as 30 would  go rogue  and vote for someone else.Now that he s solidified his win, what s going to happen? Well, for one thing, we can probably expect him to continue using his position to make himself richer. The Trump Organization has been pressuring foreign diplomats to hold their events at his hotel in D.C. Trump also canceled a press conference slated for Dec. 15, in which he was supposed to tell us how he was going to divest himself of his businesses.There s a chance he ll be impeached fairly quickly after assuming office because of that, depending on whether there s a case over the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.Aside from that, though, Trump is now the president. We re probably in for a wild ride, and not in a good way.Photo of Donald Trump by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images. Photo of Hillary Clinton by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",

        "text": "In 2016, celebrities came together to create an emotional video that minimized crimes committed or incidents that led to the death of black men and women, both young and old, across America. One of those celebrities was U2 s lead singer, Bono.For many, Bono s part in the video was even more controversial because he attempted to link the death of 9 black church members in South Carolina, who died while conducting a bible study at the hands of a young racist man, Dylann Roof, (who has since been sentenced to death for his heinous crime) with white cops who have killed blacks and have been found not guilty of intentional murder.The video doesn t just shine a light on injustices by white police officers, it promotes an atmosphere of hate and distrust for white people in America.It seems rather unusual that after U2 s Bono would cancel his concert in St. Louis that was scheduled for tonight, following a night of violent protests that led to the breaking of windows in the St. Louis Mayor s home (who supports BLM) and the shutting down of traffic for  safety  reasons. Isn t this the same group he stood by when he participated in the controversial video above? Why would Black Lives Matter protesters harm anyone who came to see an entertainer who stood by them in such a powerful and emotional video?Why not host the concert? Let your fans know you support the people rioting in the streets. Give everyone a chance to sing kumbaya Here s U2 s announcement on Twitter that they are canceling their concert out of concern for their fans  safety . The hypocritical tweet reads: Tonight s St. Louis Show Cancelled  We cannot risk fans  safety. Tonight's St. Louis Show Cancelled'We cannot risk fans' safety.'

        "text": "Why should a nation founded on Christianity need to even ask that question?Why are Christian minorities, who are the most to suffer from the chaos engulfing the Middle East, the least wanted in the United States?To the Obama administration, the only  real  refugees are those made so due to the actions of Bashar Assad. As for those who are being raped, slaughtered, and enslaved based on their religious identity by so-called  rebel  forces fighting Assad   including the Islamic State   their status as refugees is evidently considered dubious at best.The Obama administration never seems to miss an opportunity to display its bias for Muslims against Christians. The State Dept. is in the habit of inviting scores of Muslim representatives but denying visas to solitary Christian representatives. While habitually ignoring the slaughter of Christians at hands of Boko Haram, the administration called for the  human rights  of the jihadi murderers.In Islamic usage, the  cause of Allah  is synonymous with jihad to empower and enforce Allah s laws on earth, or Sharia. In this context, immigrating into Western lands is a win-win for Muslims: if they die in the process somehow, paradise is theirs; if they do not, the  locations and abundance  of the West are theirs.Muslims all around the U.S. are supporting the Islamic State and Muslim clerics are relying on the refugee influx to conquer Western nations, in the Islamic tradition of Hijrah, or jihad by emigration.The fate of those Iraqi Christians who had fled from the Islamic State only to be incarcerated in the United States has finally been decided by the Obama administration: they are to be thrown back to the lions, where they will likely be persecuted, if not slaughtered, like so many Iraqi Christians before them.Fifteen of the 27 Iraqi Christians that have been held at a detention center in Otay Mesa, California, for approximately six months, are set to be deported in the coming weeks. Some have already been deported and others are being charged with immigration fraud.Many of the Iraqi Christian community in San Diego   including U.S. citizen family members vouching for the refugees   had hopes that they would eventually be released. Mark Arabo, a spokesman for the Chaldean community, had argued that  They ve escaped hell. Let s allow them to reunite with their families.  One of the detained women had begged to see her ailing mother before she died. The mother died before they could reunite, and now the daughter is to be deported, possibly back to the hell of the Islamic State.Why are Christian minorities, who are the most to suffer from the chaos engulfing the Middle East, the least wanted in the United States?The answer is that the Obama administration defines refugees as people  persecuted by their government.  In other words, the only  real  refugees are those made so due to the actions of Syrian President Bashar Assad. As for those who are being raped, slaughtered, and enslaved based on their religious identity by so-called  rebel  forces fighting Assad   including the Islamic State   their status as refugees is evidently considered dubious at best.As Abraham H. Miller argues in  No room in America for Christian refugees : What difference does it make which army imperils the lives of innocent Christians? Christians are still be[ing] slaughtered for being Christian, and their government is incapable of protecting them. Does some group have to come along   as Jewish groups did during the Holocaust   and sardonically guarantee that these are real human beings? The Obama administration never seems to miss an opportunity to display its bias for Muslims against Christians.The U.S. State Dept. is in the habit of inviting scores of Muslim representatives but denying visas to solitary Christian representatives. While habitually ignoring the slaughter of Christians at hands of Boko Haram, the administration called for the  human rights  of the jihadi murderers. And when persecuted Egyptian Copts planned on joining the anti-Muslim Brotherhood revolution, Obama said no. Then there is the situation that every Arab nation the Obama administration has meddled in   for example, Libya and Syria   has seen a dramatic nosedive in the human rights of Christian minorities.The Obama administration s bias is evident even regarding the Iraqi Christians  illegal crossing of the U.S.-Mexico border, the occasion on which they were arrested.WND correctly observes:  At the same time the Obama administration [is] deporting Christians, it has over the years allowed in hundreds of Muslim migrants from Africa and the Middle East who crossed the Southern border the same way the Chaldeans did. Meanwhile, as the Obama administration nitpicks at the definition of refugee and uses it against severely persecuted Christian minorities, it turns out that four out of five migrants   or 80 percent   are not even from Syria.And while Christian minorities pose little threat to the United States   indeed, they actually bring benefits to U.S. security   Muslims all around the U.S. are supporting the Islamic State and Muslim clerics are relying on the refugee influx to conquer Western nations, in the Islamic tradition of Hijrah, or jihad by emigration. As Koran 4:100 puts it:And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many locations and abundance. And whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to Allah and His Messenger and then death overtakes him   his reward has already become incumbent upon Allah.In Islamic usage, the  cause of Allah  is synonymous with jihad to empower and enforce Allah s laws on earth, or Sharia. In this context, immigrating into Western lands is a win-win for Muslims: if they die in the process somehow, paradise is theirs; if they do not, the  locations and abundance  of the West are theirs.All the while, the Obama administration is turning away Christian refugees fleeing the same hostile Muslim forces as Muslims   who are being welcomed into America and Europe.Via: Gatestone Institute",

        "title": " Prominent Psychiatrist Gives One DAMNING Reason Why We Shouldn\u2019t Call Trump \u2018Mentally Ill\u2019 (IMAGE)",
        "text": "Given Donald Trump s disastrous presidential campaign and his even worse first month in the White House, several experts have raised suspicions that Trump is mentally ill and must be evaluated immediately. However, for prominent psychiatrist Allen Francis, M.D., there s one major reason we shouldn t be calling Trump mentally ill   because he s something far, far worse.Dr. Frances, professor emeritus of psychiatry and behavior sciences at Duke University Medical Center, has just written a damning letter to the editor of The New York Times stating that regarding Trump as mentally ill is a direct insult to those with mental illnesses. According to Dr. Frances, who was involved in writing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (D.S.M.-IV), Trump  is bad, not mad  and  crazy only like a fox.  Frances said that claiming Trump has a mental illness is: a stigmatizing insult to the mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped with Mr. Trump (who is neither).Unlike those with actual mental illnesses, Dr. Frances argues that Trump causes distress rather than experiencing it  and has been rewarded for his  grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy.  Instead of busying ourselves trying to decide if Trump is mentally ill or not, Dr. Frances believes that: He can, and should, be appropriately denounced for his ignorance, incompetence, impulsivity and pursuit of dictatorial powers. Many mental health experts have spoken out about Trump before, but this is by far the most critical of them. No one can argue with Dr. Frances  assessment; everything Dr. Frances has pointed out about Trump s behavior have been things that Trump has done very publicly. You can read his full letter in The New York Times below: And is just the icing on the cake. Dr. Frances also wrote a blog post in Psychology Today in which he urged people to focus on Trump s actions instead of his mental state. Dr. Frances wrote: The urge among amateur diagnosticians to mislabel Trump as mentally ill is perfectly understandable. They are terrified (as am I) by his dictatorial and impulsive behavior and feel compelled to resort to psychiatric name calling as a way of delegitimizing him. But this is inaccurate, unnecessary, unfair to the mentally ill, ineffective, and badly off target.We must challenge Trump on his outrageous behaviors and constant lies, not on his mental status. Speculations on Trump s psychological motivations, or whether he believes his own lies, are both distracting and irrelevant.At this crucial moment, with our fragile democracy at serious risk, I really couldn t care less why Trump does what he does. It is his dangerous actions that count, not the psychological reasons he does them. Dr. Frances also tweeted this on Tuesday: I m so tired of amateur analyses of Trump s psychology or diagnosis. Focus on real danger- his grab of dictator power. Dr. Frances is dead right. While we may never understand what goes on in Trump s mind, the real threat to America is his love of unchecked power   and we shouldn t lose sight of that.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images",

        "text": "President Trump addressed the America people today, as he outlined a new and bold national security strategy. The American people are generous. You are determined, you are brave, you are strong, and you are wise. When the American people speak, all of us should listen. And just over one year ago, you spoke loud and you spoke clear. And On November 8th, 2016, you voted to Make America Great Again. You embraced new leadership, and very new strategies, and also a glorious new hope, that is why we are here today. But to seize the opportunities of the future, we must first understand the failures of the past. America  will pursue threats to their source, so that jihadist terrorists are stopped before they ever reach our borders. Legal Insurrection reports- The White House has unveiled President Donald Trump s national security strategy. It has four main points: Protect America, promote our prosperity, preserve peace through strength, and advance our influence.But one of the biggest points is the return of using  jihadist  and  Sharia,  language President Barack Obama s administration tried to avoid.From Fox News: The primary transnational threats Americans face are from jihadist terrorists and transnational criminal organizations,  the document states, according to excerpts released ahead of the speech.A search of the document shows the word jihadist appears 24 times in the 68 page document. Obama s 2015 national security strategy mentioned Islam twice.The document mentions that America  will pursue threats to their source, so that jihadist terrorists are stopped before they ever reach our borders. Trump listed the ways to do this: disrupt terror plots, take direct actions, eliminate terrorist safe havens, sever sources of strength, share responsibility, and combat radicalization & recruitment in communities.David Reaboi at Security Studies Group noted another massive change:Here is my favorite part of the National Security Strategy and it s MASSIVE Admin acknowledges Sharia is goal and driving force behind Islamist terror groups. Obama effectively banned use of any of this terminology. pic.twitter.com/2HVHhnVqjX  David Reaboi (@davereaboi) December 18, 2017He is correct. Back in January 2016, Homeland Security released a report that called for officials to stop using jihad and sharia. The Washington Free Beacon reported at the time:Under the section on terminology, the report calls for rejecting use of an  us versus them  mentality by shunning Islamic language in  Countering Violent Extremism  programs, or CVE, the Obama administration s euphemism that seeks to avoid references to Islam.Under a section on recommended actions on terminology, the report says DHS should  reject religiously-charged terminology and problematic positioning by using plain meaning American English. Government agencies should employ  American English instead of religious, legal and cultural terms like  jihad,   sharia,   takfir  or  umma,  states the June 2016 report by the Council s countering violent extremism subcommittee. The DHS report stated that to avoid a confrontational  us versus them  stance in public efforts to counter Islamic radicalization, government programs should use the term  American Muslim  instead of  Muslim American. The Obama administration insisted on this even though ISIS made it NO secret that they wanted the world to live under Sharia law. The terrorist group even formed an all female brigade to help enforce Sharia law through brutal and violent means. ",

The term  asset  refers to people with countries or organizations being spied upon who serve as resources for outside spies.Clapper appeared on CNN to discuss Trump s national security strategy speech given Monday, where he referred to Russia as a rival but also said he wanted to form a partnership.The two leaders have also expressed recent gratitude to each other, with Putin calling and thanking Trump for sharing intelligence that helped foil a terror plot and Trump thanking Putin for his recent praise of the American economy.IS THIS GUY KIDDING:This is on the same day that we learn the following about the Obama administration:The Obama administration intentionally derailed investigations into the terrorist group Hezbollah s drug trafficking operation to secure the Iran nuclear deal, according to a new bombshell report.Politico spoke with several members of Project Cassandra, a joint effort between the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Pentagon that was founded in 2008 under the Bush administration to identify and prosecute a drug trafficking, money laundering, and smuggling operation run by the Iranian-backed militants.Over the next eight years, agents working out of a top-secret DEA facility in Chantilly, Virginia, used wiretaps, undercover operations, and informants to map Hezbollah s illicit networks, with the help of 30 U.S. and foreign security agencies.They followed cocaine shipments, some from Latin America to West Africa and on to Europe and the Middle East, and others through Venezuela and Mexico to the United States. They tracked the river of dirty cash as it was laundered by, among other tactics, buying American used cars and shipping them to Africa. And with the help of some key cooperating witnesses, the agents traced the conspiracy, they believed, to the innermost circle of Hezbollah and its state sponsors in Iran.Read more: WFB",

        "text": "One of Donald Trump s biggest fans, Fox News host Sean Hannity, has just tried to come to his rescue after the POTUS was condemned for his disgusting attack on Morning Joe hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.On Saturday, as Trump himself was having a meltdown on Twitter, Hannity decided to join the chaos by defending Trump and his petty, nasty attacks on the Morning Joe hosts. In a disgusting attempt to kiss Trump s *ss, Hannity made an insane threat to the MSNBC news couple, hinting that he had some incriminating dirt on the Morning Joe hosts.No one really knows what the hell  going  there'  actually means, but he s likely trying to channel Trump in his ominous threat   and if he s really trying to emulate Trump, we can bet that he s bluffing.Hannity has a history of going after Scarborough, having previously claimed that Scarborough has many skeletons  in his  closet (& office).  When Hannity had made those statements, he was referring to an incident in which a dead intern was found in Scarborough s district office during his time as a Congressman in 2001. While Scarborough had nothing to do with the intern s death, he resigned from his position due to the conspiracy theories surrounding the incident. Coincidentally, Trump also loves conspiracy theories.While we re not aware of what other nonsense Hannity might want to spread about Scarborough and Brzezinski, is certainly a shame that he s threatening the couple just because they re speaking out against Trump.Hannity s cryptic tweet proves that Fox News and its reporters will do anything to defend Trump, no matter how bad it makes them look. Just last month, Hannity said he would be willing to pay for therapy for the Morning Joe hosts because he felt they d become  unhinged.  Clearly, it s the other way around.Featured image is a screenshot",

        "text": "Anyone who knows anything about the Civil Rights Movement and its highlights knows about Bloody Sunday. It was the Sunday in the late winter/early spring of 1965 where many civil rights leaders and protesters lost their lives at the hands of law enforcement and others who wanted to keep racism alive on a legal level. Roughly 600 people assembled in Selma, Alabama after a march from Montgomery that Sunday   March 7, 1965   and today is the 51st anniversary of that March.Another widely known fact is that esteemed and celebrated U.S. Congressman John Lewis was there. Not only was he there, but he was beaten within an inch of his life for protesting for the civil rights of black people. Luckily, he survived to tell the tale, and has decided to tweet the timeline of what happened to him and others in the time leading up to that fateful day.

        "title": "BILDERBERG: More Secret Meetings with Trump Advisors, US Senators",
        "text": "Mark Anderson The Truth HoundThe danger-ridden, tyrannical goal of creating an all-consuming corporate-ruled world superstate dubbed  One World Ltd.  -incrementally advanced since Bilderberg first met in Holland in 1954 under the auspices of Jesuit-trained European consolidator Joseph Retinger and his agent, Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands   explains why Bilderberg goes to such lengths to keep the details of its inner-workings so secret, while functioning as an off-the-grid world networking and planning forum for private governance benefitting the banking and general corporate classes. A core tactic is to parallel but eventually supersede the nation state itself, thereby canceling effective, genuine nationhood altogether.Bilderberg s gatherings, for the record, consist of about 140 mainly North American and European corporate moguls (including select big media), government ministers, treasury officials, parliament members, high-technology leaders, certain royalty (including Bernhard s daughter, Netherlands Queen Beatrix) and central bankers who annually skulk into the world s top hotels, in order to cross-pollinate to pursue One World Ltd. and related financial and political dealings.McMASTER, TWO U.S. SENATORS ATTENDINGIt s highly notable that President Donald Trump s National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster, is listed as an attendee for this year s Bilderberg meeting June 1-4 in Chantilly, Va., at Westfields Marriot. Other U.S. officials attending who are currently serving in public office are Senators Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). While Graham jetted to last year s Bilderberg meeting in Dresden, Germany, Cotton evidently is attending his first-ever Bilderberg meeting.SEE ALSO: BILDERBERG: What s The Big Deal?The 65th Bilderberg gathering this year has 131 participants from 21 countries having confirmed their attendance. The entire attendee and official topic lists (but not necessarily complete) can be found at this link [note on this list the large amount of serving Trump Administration officials, and this year s Bilderberg features more active duty US officials than any other previous meeting].McMaster, Graham and Cotton all share a neo-conservative ideology of aggressively patrolling the world, in conjunction with the UK and the EU, to push Western  democracy  and monopoly capitalism, while fostering hostility toward Iran, Russia and Syria, for the benefit of Zionism, among other things. This fits the Bilderberg credo of using one might say leasing U.S. military power and other influence to control the natural resources and economic machinery of as many nations as possible, while co-opting or overthrowing those nations that stand firm with their own sovereignty.The Virginia gathering marks Bilderberg s first North American meeting in five years. Last year in Germany, according to the group s officially shallow  press release,  they discussed (in their own words):  Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Chemical Weapons Threats, Current Economic Issues, European Strategy, Globalisation, Greece, Iran, Middle East, NATO, Russia, Terrorism, United Kingdom, USA and U.S. Elections.The group s press releases, a marvel of  revealing simplicity,  typically present bluntly-worded topics, such as  Russia,   Iran   United Kingdom,   European Strategy  and so on. Such topics are clearly indicative of Bilderberg s objectives and concerns for maintaining Western hegemony over Russia and its allies, Iran and Syria, which could include war or the risk of war with Iran and does include targeting Syria under the guise of  fighting  ISIS Continue this story at The Truth HoundNOTE: The May 24 North American premiere of  Bilderberg, the Movie,  produced by researcher and author Daniel Estulin and covered exclusively by The TRUTH HOUND among national mainstream and alternative news outlets, stressed one point that cannot be overstressed: The Bilderberg Group above all is in pursuit of   One World Ltd.  On that note, the movie s promotional flyer asked:  What do people who have $1,000,000,000,000,000 talk about in private? While the Estulin movie itself, of course, could not be filmed, videographer Ron Avery shot footage of Estulin s question-and-answer session immediately afterwards.

Firstly, the language used is highly sensational and conspiratorial, with phrases such as 'tyrannical goal of creating an all-consuming corporate-ruled world superstate' and 'One World Ltd.' that are typical of conspiracy theories. Additionally, the article cites a movie called 'Bilderberg, the Movie' as a source, which is not a credible or reputable source of information. The article also makes claims about the Bilderberg Group's goals and activities that are not supported by credible evidence. Furthermore, the article's tone and style are more reminiscent of a blog post or opinion piece than a factual news article. Overall, while the Bilderberg Group is a real organization, the article's claims and tone suggest that it is likely fake or misleading."

Once a government makes the decision to open its borders to anyone who cares to come in and to support them, regardless of the size of family, or age of the wife (or in many cases multiple wives), it s very hard to turn off the government spigot Politicians in Denmark have condemned the asylum seeker policy which will allow Daham Al Hasan to rake in thousands in benefits once his huge family is reunited.The 47-year-old fled war-torn Syria two years ago with a wife and eight children before arriving in Denmark.The unemployed migrant, who claims to be too sick to work, has now been granted family reunification for his remaining 12 children and two wives who are still in Syria.The migrant also said the pain was so overwhelming that he could not learn Danish yet.The approval will see the Danish taxpayer fork out 214,128 Danish Kroners ( 21,883) in child support for the family each year.Outraged officials have raised concerns about the policy and suggested the Syrian man is exploiting the country s welfare system.Integration spokesperson for the Conservatives, Naser Khader, said:  It is highly problematic that a Syrian refugee can be allowed to call himself sick to avoid working and learning Danish, so he can support  20 children. The politician added it should not be possible for someone who does not intend to work to be given such vast sums and called for Denmark to implement an upper limit for the number of children a person can claim contributions for.Shader said:  We need to save and it can t be right that a man, who has not contributed, is granted hundreds of thousands in child support.

She grew up surrounded by American culture and values religious freedom as guaranteed by the Constitution.And that is why she is able to wear a hijab and practice Islam.But while she was standing on the subway platform waiting to go home, three male Trump supporters targeted her and began harassing her. They called her a  terrorist,  ripped the straps on her bag, and tried to forcibly remove her hijab all while saying Trump s name.The abuse continued on the train and Seweid was forced to exit at an early stop in order to get away from them. Bystanders even watched the incident unfold and cowardly did nothing to stop it.She reported the incident to police, who are investigating the crime.In order to warn others about the dangers of Trump supporters, Seweid chose to write about her horrific experience on Facebook. I take the train every single day going to & coming from class, but yesterday, something happened that I never thought would happen to me,  Seweid wrote.  I was harassed on the subway last night and it was just so dehumanizing I can t speak about it without getting emotional. Three white racists ripped the straps off my bag & attempted to yank my hijab off my head. They yelled such disgusting slurs at me, I was so helpless and felt defenseless.  Look it s a fucking terrorist ,  go back to your country ,  take that rag off your head  and so many more. Trump s name was repeatedly said & it finally clicked in my head. No matter how  cultured  or  Americanized  I am, these people don t see me as an American.It breaks my heart that so many individuals chose to be bystanders while watching me get harassed verbally and physically by these disgusting pigs. Trump America is real and I witnessed it first hand last night! What a traumatizing night. Please stay safe everyone & never let anyone take your rights away. Just thought I should share that with you all tonight.Here s her full post via Facebook.Ever since Election Day, Trump supporters have been celebrating by committing hate crimes against women and minorities. In fact, the number of hate crimes skyrocketed and nearly 900 of them have been committed in the weeks since November 8th. And experts say it is worse than the number of hate crimes committed after the 9/11 attacks.Donald Trump has done nothing more than create an atmosphere of hate and violence in this country. With that being said, his call for unity is complete bullshit. We can t have unity in this country when his own supporters are going around terrorizing people.Featured Image: Steve Pope/Getty Images",

Instead, he calmed the crowd down. Hey! Hey! Listen up! I told you to be focused and you re not focused now. Listen to what I m saying,  he said, even saying  hold up  about 18 times to get the crowd to stop booing Mr. Trump Fan. Everybody sit down and be quiet for a second. He not doing nothin ,  the President continued.  You don t need to worry about him. Instead of insulting the man for wearing what appears to be a military uniform like Trump would, the President called for the crowd to respect the man s service to his country.Pointing out that the man was apparently a veteran and elderly ( we gotta respect our elders ), the President told the crowd not to  lose focus  worrying about the awkwardly out-of-place Trump worshipper.Can you imagine what would have happened if someone held up a Hillary sign at one of Trump s events?

        "title": "Cheerleading Assassination: Are Hollywood and Politicians Going Too Far?",
        "text": "21st Century Wire says Everyone has the right to air their perceived grievances about anything, including President Trump, that is one of the benefits of living in America. But there is a point where expressing grievances or protesting against policies or politicians can shift from legal protest, assembly and expression of free speech to inciting or promoting violence. We ve seen some interesting cases of public figures coming close to and maybe crossing that line during the last week.Some Hollywood celebrities, entertainers and politicians may have taken the concept of free speech a little too far when trying to express their disdain for President Trump. Celebrities Madonna and Ashley Judd lashed out with bizarre tirades during the  Women s March  in the wake of the Trump inaugural festivities.The antics of the celebs at the DC  Women s March  was a hot topic of discussion on Sunday Wire Ep #170 with Patrick Henningsen and Hesher in the final segment of the show.Madonna went as far as to say she d thought about  blowing up the White House  which she now claims was said in metaphor only, but still got her a lot of negative attention from the media, from Trump supporters and even caught the attention of the Secret Service.What Madonna and those cheering her on actually want and what they are planning to do to achieve it is as clear as mud after this protest. If the  Revolution  she speaks of is metaphorical only, then what are the goals of her and the rest of the protesters when she speaks of revolution? Chants of,  We Chose Love!  after statements, hypothetical or metaphorical, about  revolution  and  blowing up the White House  send a very confused message.Madonna claims that her comments about the White House were taken out of context, listen to the full recording and you be the judge.Warning Madonna s speech may not be appropriate for the work place or around young children due to profanity.The singer later claimed, on her Instagram page, that she is a nonviolent person and that she was not promoting violence when she said a  revolution  was starting after  good did not win this election. Yesterday s Rally. was an amazing and beautiful experience. I came and performed Express Yourself and thats exactly what i did. However I want to clarify some very important things. I am not a violent person, I do not promote violence and it s important people hear and understand my speech in it s entirety rather than one phrase taken wildly out of context. My speech began with   I want to start a revolution of love.    I then go on to take this opportunity to encourage women and all marginalized people to not fall into despair but rather to come together and use it as a starting point for unity and to create positive change in the world. I spoke in metaphor and I shared two ways of looking at things   one was to be hopeful, and one was to feel anger and outrage, which I have personally felt. However, I know that acting out of anger doesn t solve anything. And the only way to change things for the better is to do it with love. It was truly an honor to be part of an audience chanting  we choose love .   #revoltutionoflove #revolutionoflove *******************************************************A photo posted by Madonna (@madonna) on Jan 22, 2017 at 10:49am PSTKatie Rich of Saturday Night Live was suspended for what even she herself now concedes was an insensitive tweet about Barron Trump, 10 year old son of Donald Trump. Jumping on the bandwagon of ridiculing all things Trump, Rich tweeted out that,  Barron will be this contry s first homeschool shooter. Rich was suspended indefinitely by SNL after the tweet and her Twitter account was later deactivated after she tweeted an apology. Her name did not appear in the credits for the next broadcast of SNL on Saturday.Could it be that people are actually being held responsible for their over-reach on social media and on their self perceived Hollywood soap boxes? Certainly not in all cases, but the Katie Rich case is a great example of how one can ruin a career with a single mean spirited, politically fueled Tweet aimed at a ten year old.As we turn to a political example, we find a Swedish politician who s stepped down from his position after a Facebook post where he asked if  someone could shoot him  when talking about Donald Trump.Municipal council member, Roland Peterson, went too far on his criticism of Donald Trump and provoked an angry response from his fellow party and council members.More on this phenomenon from RT  RTA municipal council member of a Swedish town called Kalmar has resigned due to a Facebook post he made asking if someone could  shoot  America s new president, Donald Trump. I believed that Donald Trump would calm down after he became the president [of the US]. But how wrong I was! He exceeded my worst fears! Could anyone shoot him?  Swedish Social Democratic Party member Roland Peterson, a municipal official in Kalmar s Soedermoere district, wrote on his Facebook page on Sunday, though he removed it an hour later.Nonetheless, Peterson decided to step down as member of both his party and the Soedermoere Municipal Council and Planning Board after making the post, announcing his resignation on Monday morning. After my blunder on Facebook, there is a risk that I will become a burden for the Social Democrats in Kalmar. I do not want it, so I chose to leave all my posts,  Peterson wrote in a letter to his party members, as cited by the local Oestra Smaland newspaper.Person s post provoked an angry reaction from his party members and fellow councilors. It is good that he [Peterson] removed it [the post],  councilor Johan Persson told Oestra Smalan, adding that people should  never call for violence  regardless of their opinion of Donald Trump or other issues.The Social Democrats  leader in Kalmar, Roger Holmberg, denounced the post as  inappropriate  and  idiotic,  while stressing that  even thinking about the idea of violence is completely wrong.  He told Swedish broadcaster STV that he had had a conversation with Peterson and said that new party members would receive training in working with social media.Holmber said that Peterson  is deeply remorseful,  explaining that he  did not understand the impact of the post in the social media. Peterson told STV that he  would have never written  the post if he had considered the consequences, while promising he  will never do it again.  He also explained to Oestra Smalan that it was Trump s environmental policy that had deeply upset him. He [Trump] risks the future of the entire Earth,  he said, adding that  now, when the world has started going in the right direction,  Trump plans to increase oil and coal production.Trump s ideas about the environmental are a source of controversy in the US. Social media went into meltdown after Trump s inauguration when certain hot topic issues disappeared from the White House website, including climate change.Many mainstream media outlets initially reported on the conspicuous disappearances, but are adopting a more cautious  wait-and-see  approach for the time being.Anti-Trump angst was running high both in the US and abroad after his inauguration. On Saturday, Donald Trump s first full day in the White House, thousands of women marched through US cities to protest Trump and call for the protection of civil liberties and diverse cultures Continue this report at RTRead More Election News at: 21st Century Wire Election CoverageSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV",

        "text": "Ben Carson is setting all three of his supporters up for disappointment. In a statement Wednesday, the retired neurosurgeon announced that, in light of his crushing defeat on Super Tuesday, he will likely no longer continue the charade that can loosely be called his presidential campaign.Carson announced that he will be skipping the Fox News Presidential Debate in his hometown of Detroit on Thursday.  I remain deeply committed to my home nation, America,  Cason s statement says.  I do not see a political path forward in light of last evening s Super Tuesday primary results. Carson promised that  this grassroots movement of  We the People  will continue. I appreciate the support, financial and otherwise, from all corners of America,  Carson added.   Gratefully, my campaign decisions are not constrained by finances; rather by what is in the best interests of the American people. Carson s attempt to  become the man to lose to the Democratic nominee started out promising. But Carson s campaign took a series of wrong turns that thrust him as far into political obscurity as Carly Fiorina after the Center for Medical Progress   baby parts  videos were shown to be heavily-edited and fraudulent.Carson s wild tales   like his claim that he once tried to gut a motherf*cker only to be thwarted by a rogue belt buckle and that he attacked his mother with a hammer,  his story about bravely telling an armed robber to shoot a Popeye s Chicken cashier, as well as his wild theory that Biblical storybook character Joseph built the pyramids to store grain  did him absolutely no favors, nor did his complaint that Obama isn t black enough. His campaign also suffered from numerous shakeups, like much of his staff abandoning the sinking ship that was Team Carson all at once.While he was reluctant to give up, Carson seems to have finally come to his senses. Now, perhaps, he will have time to travel to Egypt with his buddy Jesus so they can have their portrait painted inside a grain pyramid.He promises to discuss more about his future plans at CPAC, the annual gathering of Christofascist lunatics like Carson.As the Stupid Part of America s options narrow, one thing remains certain   it is more important than ever that you make it to the polls in November.Here are some of the dumbest things Carson has said.

        "text": "B..b but George Soros and Barack Obama told UK voters NOT to leave the EU. Is this historic vote a sign that voters in the UK are 100% FED Up with globalists telling them what to do? David Cameron stands down as British Prime Minister after voters trigger a political earthquake   and global market panic   by backing vote to leave the European Union in historic referendum.

Mr Cameron tried to reassure businesses around the world that Britain s economy was fundamentally sound but world markets were thrown into turmoil on Friday after the final vote was announced.Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump arrived in Scotland on Friday morning and said the British people had  taken back their country , adding:  It s a fantastic thing .Later, when asked his opinion on Cameron quitting, Trump said:  Well, that s too bad. But Britain s former Prime Minister Tony Blair said Brexit would have  enormous consequences  and it was  very sad for our country, for Europe, for the world .Mr Cameron said he would stay on for three months and New York-born Boris Johnson, the former Mayor of London who led the  leave  campaign, is the hot favorite to replace him. Polls had for months suggested a close battle, although the past few days have seen some indication of momentum swinging toward the  remain  side.At a referendum night party at the London School of Economics, Kevin Featherstone, the head of the European Institute, said the vote should serve as a wake-up call to politicians across the continent. Wider Europe has got to learn the lesson about how to re-engage with ordinary publics,  he said.  We can see across Europe countries which have been   far bigger supporters of the European Union for a number of years starting to have serious doubts. But Peter Lundgren, an MEP from the far-right Sweden Democrat Party, told MailOnline:  This is the beginning of the end for the EU. So many other countries will follow the UK. Europe will fall.  Politicians in Sweden, Denmark, Italy and even Germany may come under pressure to hold referendums in the wake of Brexit.European Parliament President Martin Schulz said the EU assembly would hold an emergency session on Tuesday and Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said that after  the blow  of Britain voting to leave, the whole European project needed a rethink.Germany s Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed  great regret  at the result, but said the EU was  strong enough  to  find the right answers  to the vote.EU President Donald Tusk, from Poland, said it was  a historic moment but for sure not a moment for hysterical reactions . Tusk, who had earlier warned that Brexit could  end Western political civilization , said on Friday:  Today on behalf of the 27 leaders, I can say that we are determined to keep our unity as 27. Merkel, Tusk, French President Francois Hollande and Italy s Matteo Renzi are planning to meet in Berlin on Monday to discuss the next step.Mr Cameron has suggested he would delay invoking Article 50   which triggers formal exit from the EU   until his successor takes over in the fall, but the EU leaders may decide they want a quick and clean break with the UK to avoid continuing instability.As results poured in, a picture emerged of a sharply divided nation: Strong pro-EU votes in London and semi-autonomous Scotland were countered by sweeping anti-Establishment sentiment for an exit across the rest of England, from southern seaside towns to rust-belt former industrial powerhouses in the north.Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP), said June 23 should be considered Britain s  Independence Day . But in a remark that could prove controversial after pro-Europe MP Jo Cox was shot dead last week, Mr Farage said the country was separating from the EU  without a single bullet being fired .Via: UK Daily Mail",

        "title": "US-Saudi Plan: Let 9,000 ISIS Fighters Walk Free from Mosul \u2013 to Fight in Syria",
        "text": " Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireJudging by both the words, and deeds of the Obama White House and its political  diplomatic  appointees led by perfidious John Kerry and caustic Samantha Power   all evidence to date points to the US wanting to escalate its war on Syria   while happily baiting a military confrontation, and World War  scenario with Russia and its allies in the process. If this latest leak is indeed true   and time will certainly tell whether or not it is, it would constitute one of the most egregious violations of both US and international law   by the United States government and its theocratic dictator partner in Saudi Arabia.Washington s own anti-terror legislation expressly forbids colluding to provide logistical or material support for terrorist groups, and this US-Saudi venture would be the latest in a long list of violations  According to news released today (see report below), US President Barack Obama has been briefed that the operation to liberate the ISIS stronghold in Mosul in Iraq is scheduled for the second half of October. Here s what makes this a potential shocker: the operation allows for safe passage for 9,000 ISIS fighters on the proviso that they are transferred from Iraq to eastern Syria in order to help US plans for  regime change  there. At the time of the assault, coalition aircraft would strike only on a pre-agreed detached buildings in the city, which are empty, the source said. According to him [the source], the plan of Washington and Riyadh also provides that the rebels move from Mosul to Syria for the attack on the government-controlled town of troops. Essentially, Washington and Saudi Arabia, will allow 9,000 ISIS (Islamic State) fighter FREE passage into Syria if they agree to join Washington s  regime change  operations there. This could also include,   eastern regions of Syria to follow a major offensive operation, which involves the capture of Deir ez-Zor and Palmyra,  the source added.Before you write this story off as some ornate Russian psychological operation, consider the long trend arch. The US along with its generous Gulf sidekicks, have already established a solid track record of aiding and abetting ISIS   not just in Syria, but in Iraq too.The record shows that the US is guilty on a number of counts If the Mosul leak is true, then it wouldn t be the first time that the US has provided cover in the military pantomime the world has come to know as  the fight against ISIS.  When large ISIS convoys crossed the Syrian desert to invade and occupy the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra in May 2015, the US  Coalition  airforce did nothing, and allowed ISIS to take and destroy part of the world s great historic cultural heritage, along with the murder of scores of innocent civilians.Professor Tim Anderson from Sydney University states: U.S. weapons with Israeli ammunition were used by Islamic State group when taking over Palmyra. The extremists also had U.S. military rations. The U.S., which since 2014 claimed to be conducting a war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and which had air power and sophisticated surveillance of the region, did nothing to stop the huge ISIS advance on Palmyra. The US isn t even shy about its laissez-faire policy with ISIS in the field, with the New York Times openly boasting,  Any airstrikes against Islamic State militants in and around Palmyra would probably benefit the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. So far, United States-led airstrikes in Syria have largely focused on areas far outside government control, to avoid the perception of aiding a leader whose ouster President Obama has called for. Following the derelict incident, New York Times reporters Hwaida Saad and Kareem Fahim, were still kicking and screaming for  regime change like petulant children at the news of ISIS fleeing and Palmyra being liberated by the Syrian Army and Russians. They said that,  Mr. Assad s contention that his government is a bulwark against the transnational extremist group  has been bolstered, but added that  his foes and some allies argue that he must leave power as part of a political settlement to end the war in Syria. In other words:  we still want regime change!  This says volumes about who is really enforcing New York Times editorial lines (either the US State Dept, or the CIA, take your pick).More importantly however, is what kind of message an US statement like that sends to ISIS, as well as Al Nusra and other terrorist brigades inside Syria, which is basically,  we do not need to worry about US air strikes, only Syrian Army and Russian strikes.  This situation really sums up the utter fraud and contempt of the US deception in Syria, and it s no surprise that the Russian Foreign Ministry are reticent to extend themselves any more where the US is concerned.Then, in March 2016, when ISIS fled Palmyra, back across the desert towards Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa   the great and powerful US  Coalition  airforce actually helped ISIS in a number of ways, including allowing them free passage once more.In late August, we were told that the Turkish Army, alongside  allied Syrian rebels  (terrorist group Faylaq al-Sham) backed by the US air cover, invaded Syria in order to capture the  ISIS-held  town of Jarabulus, Syria, this supposedly to cut off ISIS s last open route into Turkey. But what happened to ISIS?The NYT even admitted that,  it appeared that most of the militants had fled without a fight. Here, ISIS appears to have been given advanced warning   by either US or Turkish intelligence, as they left the contested town of Jarabulus quietly, but in droves. In reality, Turkey twisted this operation in order to attack and degrade Kurdish militias including the US-backed artificial construct called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and pro-Kurdish People s Protection Units (YPG) and Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), the Syrian affiliate of the militant Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK) in Iraq and Turkey   all of whom are meant to be fighting ISIS. Instead, they are now busy dodging Turkish artillery rounds. Confusing, yes, but true nonetheless.It s also common knowledge now, that top of the line US weaponry is being used by ISIS, both in Iraq, in Afghanistan and in Syria as well. In fact, if not for US weapons and supplies (along with US air intervention, or noninterventions), ISIS would have struggled to maintain many of the strategic positions it enjoys today. For the last 3 years, US officials have been dodging this issue, and when they do admit this is true, their patronizing party line is that,  this must be a mistake, if they do have US weapons, we didn t mean it.  As if the world was born yesterday.Perhaps the most flagrant violation by the US-led forces in aiding and abetting ISIS took place on Sept 17, 2016, when the US-led Coalition bombed Syrian Army positions outside of Deir ez-Zor near al-Tharda Mountain, killing some 80 soldiers and injuring 100 more.  As if by design, an ISIS offensive began immediately following the US massacre of Syrian soldiers. Clearly, this bold move by the Pentagon paved the way for a major ISIS advance.To any normal observer, the US attack was a belligerent act of war that effective destroyed an already fragile bilateral ceasefire agreement, and yet the US response was to somehow blame Russia for calling an emergency UNSC meeting to discuss the incident. Judging by this response, it s pretty clear that US wants to see the Syrian Conflict carry on for a while, and it will need groups like ISIS to make that happen. The other problem with Washington s hollow righteousness in the Middle East is that there are key members of the US-led Coalition  who are financing ISIS, Al Nusra Front, Nour al Din Zinki, and Arar al Sham (all  moderate terrorists we re told) militants in Syria, Iraq and beyond. This fact was recently admitted by former US Secretary of State and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, as revealed in this week s batch of Wikileaks emails. Clinton writes: While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region. Add to that the multiple exposures over the last 3 years of the US CIA illegally trafficking lethal arms to Al Nusra and other terrorists through covert operations like Timber Sycamore.Still, US and NATO member state officials and their media gatekeepers continue to deny it and play dumb, rather than come clean that the United States and its  partners  in the region are helping, not hindering ISIS terrorism.Some might ask: why would they do a thing like that? By now, the answer should be simple, but threefold:What s so comical yet even more tragic, is how prominent the topic of  ISIS  factors into all of the vapid  national security  debates and media panels in this year s US Presidential election, and in the dumbed-down  coverage of the delusional US mainstream media, led by Pentagon surrogate CNN, and hopeless FOX News. Judging by their prosaic  coverage , neither the networks, nor Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump have the slightest clue of what the reality on the ground is. Instead we here,  My ISIS plan is better than yours!  The US political conversation has gone beyond ridiculousness.The corps of US military and CIA media spokesman aren t much better. The sad part is some of them do know what is really happening, but would rather lie to the American public.With so much double dealing, who can you trust? Certainly not anyone in Washington.More on the White House s latest dangerous proposition .RTThe US and Saudi Arabia have agreed to grant free passage to thousands of Islamic State militants before the Iraqi city of Mosul is stormed. The jihadists will be redeployed to fight against the government in Syria, a military-diplomatic source told RIA Novosti. More than 9,000 Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) militants will be redeployed from Mosul to the eastern regions of Syria to carry out a major offensive operation, which involves capturing Deir ez-Zor and Palmyra,  the source said.According to the anonymous diplomatic source, US President Barack Obama has already sanctioned an operation to liberate Mosul, due to take place in October.During the storm of the city in northern Iraq the US-led coalition s planes would only strike detached, vacated or uninhabited buildings, while keeping terrorists as targets, he said.In September, US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter confirmed that Washington would send an additional 600 troops to Iraq to help liberate Mosul at the request of the local authorities.The source suggested that redeployment of IS militants is necessary because  Washington must somehow counter Russia s achievements in Syria, try to diminish their importance. Apart from the purely political dividends, the other purpose of this operation, obviously, will be to discredit the success of Russian Airspace forces. And, of course, it s an attempt to undermine Syrian President (Bashar) Assad,  he said.The leadership of Saudi Arabia s General Intelligence Directorate will be the mediators and guarantors of the agreement on safe passage for the jihadists from Mosul, he claimed.The source added that a similar scheme had been used by the US and its allies during the liberation of the Iraqi city of Fallujah Continue this story at RTREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS: 21st Century Wire Syria FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",

        "text": "The London terror attack was a horrific scene with injured bodies strewn everywhere after a vehicle plowed into pedestrians on the Westminster Bridge. While some simply walked by bodies on the street, others got down on their hands and knees to either administer CPR or to just offer encouragement and comfort for the victims until paramedics arrived.A heroic Team GB boxing coach jumped over a fence before fighting in vain to save a police officer killed in the London terror attack, it was revealed today.Tony Davis, who was visiting the Houses of Parliament for a press conference, put PC Keith Palmer in the recovery position and tried to resuscitate him.The coach from Darlington, County Durham, also revealed on TV how he put his raincoat underneath the officer to try to stem the blood as much as he could.Mr Davis was due to be at the Commons with students from the Hammersmith Boxing Academy in West London to launch a community project.And the former Army staff sergeant, who is a coach for the British Lionhearts boxing team, told ITV s This Morning how he reacted to the horrifying attack.Mr Davis, who served 22 years in the military, was leaving the press event with a group of boxers when he saw the attack taking place.He told the program:  We were leaving the exit parallel to where the crash happened, I had my phone out to take footage for social media about the event. All of a sudden I saw a large chap brandishing two knives come through the gates and start attacking the policeman. At that point instinct kicked in, I leaped over the fence because that guy needed assistance. The police were holding their ground and that is when poor Keith got attacked. You start moving back with adrenaline pumping in.PC Palmer was one of at least four people who died in the terrorist attack at Westminster yesterday afternoon, which left 29 others injured.An unnamed attacker mounted the pavement on Westminster Bridge, mowing down pedestrians before he stabbed PC Palmer and was shot dead by police.As the maniac ploughed along the bridge in his two-ton Hyundai SUV, frequently mounting the crowded pavement, he mowed down pedestrians like ninepins.Of those who managed to dive out of his path, one woman ended up under a bus and at least two more leapt over the bridge parapet in a desperate bid to escape.Among those struck were three police officers returning from a commendation ceremony. Three French teenagers on a school visit were also targeted.A bloodied man who was injured on Westminster Bridge is comforted by a group of peopleThree were killed and many were left with  catastrophic  injuries amid a scene of horrifying carnage. The killer began his rampage at the south side of the bridge.A man appeared to have either jumped or been thrown from the bridge, and had fallen to concrete steps about 18ft below. He lay motionless with a dark pool of blood around his head and his leg obviously broken.Moving along the bridge, a bald man lay on the white line between the bus lane and main carriageway, clutching his head. One of the most harrowing scenes was the sight of a woman s legs poking out from under the wheel of a London double-decker bus. It appeared she was either struck by the terrorist or may have tried to dodge him, only to run into the path of the No 53.For entire story:Daily Mail",

        "text": "This is a good reminder of how important it is to prevent Obama from anointing another radical on the Supreme Court. It might also be a good time for every American to call their representatives in Washington. Keeping another radical Obama appointee off our Supreme Court could literally be the only thing standing between a free America and one that looks more like Venezuela. This is also a reminder for anyone in the Republican party who considers themselves part of the  never Trump  movement. The Democrat party has never been more serious about, or closer to, fundamentally changing America forever The Obama administration is looking into whether it can challenge the Supreme Court s decision to block President Barack Obama s plan to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Tuesday. We will be reviewing the case and seeing what, if anything else, we need to do in court,  Lynch told Reuters in an interview.Lynch did not say what legal options the Obama administration may pursue following a split decision by the Supreme Court justices last week that left in place a block on the executive action by a lower court.She said any future executive actions Obama may take on immigration would be left to the White House.In a wideranging interview on topics from gun control to the effect of the planned exit of Britain from the European Union, Lynch identified espionage from foreign nationals on U.S. companies as a  tremendous problem. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported a 53 percent increase in cases of economic espionage between 2014 and 2015 and the majority of cases involve Chinese nationals as culprits.Most recently, Xu Jiaqiang, 30, was charged with economic espionage and theft of trade secrets, for stealing software source code from his U.S. employer with the intent of benefiting the Chinese government. It is a matter of priority for us,  Lynch said.  When companies or industries are preyed upon by others, be they individuals, be they state actors who literally steal the fruit of their intellectual labors, essentially they are stealing from future generations also.

        "text": "Full frontal Leftist propaganda As a side note, writer and artist Frank Miller is also a Hillary supporter Last week anarchists, socialists and Black Lives Matter terrorists joined together to protest against white police officer, Jason Van Dyke, who was already charged with first-degree murder for fatally shooting 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.The following day, DC Comics released the much-anticipated first issue of its latest Batman installment,  Dark Knight III: The Master Race.  Half of the comic is dedicated to scenes of police brutality, depicting a potentially fatal course of events halted by the caped superhero s interventions.The occasion of the issue s release heralded not only Batman s reemergence in Gotham City, but also the return of original  Dark Knight Returns  writer and artist Frank Miller. Nearly 30 years after he first penned the iconic comic series, the 58-year-old is breathing new life into his most influential work.A known provocateur, Miller has been described by turns as reactionary, overly conservative and radical. In a recent Vulture interview, he described himself as a libertarian who supports Democrat Hillary Clinton.Miller s politics have always been complicated, making his newest Batman s explicit stance against police brutality a noteworthy change of pace.This isn t the first time a comic book author has used their influence to indoctrinate young minds with a leftist narrative. We recently reported about about Disney s effort to turn popular opinion in favor of amnesty by making the villain in their latest Captain America comic book an evil conservative:DISNEY Introduces New Marvel Comic Books: Captain America (Captain Socialist) Beats Up Conservative Terrorists Defending U.S. Borders And More [VIDEO]The opening sequence of  Dark Knight III: The Master Race  is narrated through text messages between a young black man in a hoodie and his friend, presumably rehashing recent past events. The man, named  Squid,  is shown running from a police car with a cracked windshield and blood on its dashboard.As Comic Book Resources points out, colorist Brad Anderson uses only  police reds and blues  in this scene to illustrate the closeness of the cop car.Two police officers emerge from the car with their guns pointed at him. Aghast, Squid responds by showing them his open palms. Getting arrested,  reads a text bubble from Squid. 4?  his friend asks. The man dont need no reason [sic],  Squid responds in a panel showing the barrel of a gun. I was waitin for the shot,  he continues in his recollection,  BANG last sound id ever hear. Instead i heard a snap and i turned to it. Enter the superhero of the hour, a dark caped figure who swoops in and immediately shatters one of the police car s front windows. He starts beating the officers who had their guns aimed at Squid.At first, it seems like this is game over. The artwork pans to TV pundits   comic doppelgangers of Kelly Ripa, Michael Strahan, Jon Stewart, Al Sharpton and Bill O Reilly   debating the morality of Batman s actions. There s talk about how the video footage of the confrontation went viral.Then Miller moves to a different setting in the jungle with Wonder Woman, and the police encounter is briefly forgotten, only to be thrown back into sharp relief at the end.With their overt metaphors and symbolic characters, comics have a long history of steering their readers toward certain moral conclusions and inciting fury over perceived social injustices.The issue s final scenes show Batman taking the place once occupied by Squid, except this time he s far outnumbered as he runs from a parade of at least four police cars. His attempts to evade the officers seeking vengeance for their beaten colleagues are unsuccessful, as Batman runs between trucks and climbs a fire escape before committing himself to a brawl.https://twitter.com/restlessbit/status/670836492026163200Completely surrounded, Batman falls to the ground after a police officer shoots the side of his head. A horizontal panel shows 10 cops approaching him with batons in the air.The large sound effect lettering leaves little room for interpretation. WHACK. WHACK. WHACK WHACK WHACK WHACK.  He is bludgeoned seemingly endlessly. Had enough?  one of the officers asks as the troupe encircles a fallen Batman lying face-down in his own blood.This being a superhero comic, however, Batman emerges seriously injured but not defeated. With a sudden burst of energy, he punches the cop closest to him, causing them all to scatter.(The final pane reveals a significant twist to Batman s identity, but we ll leave that out because it s irrelevant to the police scene.)Via: The Washington Post ",

On Monday, Chuck Todd of NBC s Meet The Press pummeled Trump for his latest disgusting tweets and comments against the  fake news  media, and it was exactly what the country needed to hear.Todd s words are incredibly timely, as Trump is now inciting violence against members of the media, directly tweeting videos of himself beating up a reporter from CNN. Todd made note of the fact that Trump has gotten increasingly hostile during his presidency, and his  nasty  attacks on reporters have hit a new low. Todd also pointed out that Trump s administration has gone to great lengths to restrict the press and prevent them from sharing crucial details with the American people.While presidents often face criticism from the press, Todd argued that Trump s relationship with the press is in an unprecedented league of its own   and it s pretty scary. Todd said: If these actions and this language was being used by a leader in a different country, our State Department  would be saying  That country is inching towards authoritarianism.  Because that s usually the first sign: when you try to delegitimize a free press. Todd also slammed Trump for  dehumanizing  people in the media. What the president does with his tweets, and I had this conversation with him, I said don t personalize it. Attack the entities all you want, but when you attack individuals, you dehumanize. Trump s bullying isn t anything new   his racist, sexist policies and messages have long proven that Trump has the maturity of a child and is unable to have disagreements with people or process criticism like an adult. However, what Trump has now done to the media with these vicious attacks needs to be addressed as soon as possible, before someone gets hurt.You can watch Todd try to wake America up below:Featured image via video screenshot",

In the continuing fight back Russian or Syrian planes also bombed the town of Khan Sheikhoun, the scene of Tuesday s horrific chemical gas attack where 80 died, witnesses in the rebel-held area claimed. The US was also branded  a partner of ISIS  by al-Assad s spokesman, calling the missile strikes  reckless and irresponsible  and accused Trump of  naively falling  for a  false propaganda campaign  about the Idlib Sarin massacre.

        "text": "It s still more than three weeks before the incoming Trump administration is set to take office, but one member of his staff has already been forced to resign over an alleged sex scandal.Just two days after being chosen as Trump s Communication Director, Jason Miller changed his mind about the job after it was revealed that he might be a philanderer. His excuse, of course, is that he wants to spend more time with his family.The scandal broke, perhaps ironically and perhaps not at all, because another Trump staffer tweeted hints at an affair. The New York Daily News got screenshots of Trump senior advisor, A.J. Delgado s Twitter account, before the Twitter account was deleted.The first tweet congratulated Miller and then, but then it got weird. Congratulations to the baby-daddy on being named WH Comms Director!  she wrote in one now-deleted tweet. The 2016 version of John Edwards,  she wrote in another, referring to the disgraced ex-Democratic senator who fathered a child with his mistress. It s clear they need to be my top priority right now, and this is not the time to start a new job as demanding as White House communications director,  said Miller, whose wife is expecting their second child.Source: NY Daily NewsHere s the video:To be fair, a good old fashioned sex scandal seems absolutely wholesome compared to some of Trump s behavior. Not only is Trump an admitted adulterer and an accused sex offender, he s blatantly thumbing his nose at the Constitution with his conflicts of interest and with campaign improprieties.This clearly also points to the fact that Trump is not doing his due diligence when it comes to picking his staff. The President Elect hasn t been vetted, which is frightening on its own, but Congress can t do much about that fact. They can, however, put up a real fuss, if they so desire, about skeletons in the closets of Trump s nominees. The fact that this came down over the Christmas holiday, when few people are paying attention, shows how embarrassing this is to the incoming administration.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",

        "text": "She burst on the scene last August when she upset a 44-year incumbent Democrat in the Minnesota state primary elections to become the nation s first female Muslim state legislator.Ilhan Omar, the 34-year-old community organizer who came to America as a refugee from Somalia, was touted by Democrats as a model success story. From a refugee camp to the State Capitol with intelligence and insight,  beamed former Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, who endorsed Omar.  This is a wonderful story to tell as Americans, and a great source of pride for the state of Minnesota s open arms. But on Thursday Omar made her mark in another way.She was one of only two members of the Minnesota State House to vote against a bill that would allow life insurance companies to deny payouts to the beneficiaries of terrorists who die in violent attacks on Americans.Omar, who represents the heavily immigrant Cedar Riverside area of Minneapolis, was joined by fellow Democratic Rep. John Lesch of St. Paul in voting against the bill.Omar s vote sticks out because at least 42 Somali refugees have been confirmed by the FBI to have left the U.S. to join overseas terrorist organizations, including al-Shabab, the al-Qaida affiliate in Somalia, and ISIS in Syria and Iraq.Dozens of other Somali-Americans have been tried and/or convicted of providing material support to overseas terrorists.The Minneapolis-St. Paul area is home to the nation s largest Somali refugee community.The Minnesota insurance bill was introduced by Rep. Joe Hoppe, R-Chaska, in response to Syed Farook s jihadist rampage in San Bernardino, California, in December 2015 in which he shot and killed 14 people and injured 22 at an office Christmas party. Farook made sure his life insurance policies worth $275,000 were valid before conducting the deadly shooting with help from his wife, Tashfeen Malik.After Farook died in a shootout with police, his mother fought to remain the beneficiary of the life insurance policies. The insurance company balked and the case has gone to court.Democratic Rep. Debra Hilstrom said the goal of the Minnesota bill  is to make certain that folks don t benefit [from terrorism] and this limits the beneficiary to the premiums that were paid in. It limits the exposure for the insurance company when someone is committing an act of terrorism.   WNDWatch:",

According to Buzzfeed News, the sound engineer is white, but he wanted his story to be heard without his name being released, because apparently, Trump was quite a monster to him and to many others, including to women whom he sexually harassed.He told Buzzfeed: Micing him was honestly the most abusive, humiliating, experience of my fifteen years as a sound engineer. He treated me like I wasn t a human being. In fact, there were several times Trump would refer to him as a  f*cking monkey.  Trump would say: Woah, woah woah, who s this fucking monkey? As well as: I m not gonna let this fucking monkey touch me unless he washes his hands. Then he would be monitored by Trump s assistant to make sure he went and washed his hands.He also told Buzzfeed: Trump just kept calling me a  f*cking monkey  over and over. I ve mic d everyone from Ben Affleck to Ren e Zellweger, and never, ever in my career have I run into something like that. Apparently, working for him was pretty much one of the worst gigs in town. He was a monster to many, many people, including several women he would sexually harass. And after listening to Trump on the released Access Hollywood tapes, that is very, very easy to believe.Trump is not a person who should be allowed anywhere near the Oval Office. He s a racist and misogynistic egomaniac who seems to have a short temper while having none of the required experience to be leader of the free world.Something tells me there will be more and more of these stories coming out as we get closer to election day, and hopefully, it will be the icing on the cake to make sure he s never, ever elected president.Featured Photo by Amanda Edwards/Getty Images",

Rebecca Ballhaus (@rebeccaballhaus) December 8, 2017Legal Insurrection  CNN originally reported an email from Trump Jr. was sent 10 days later, a factual inaccuracy that led to a false timeline and essentially, fake news. The timeline is crucial because it proves Trump Jr. was not trading unknown information, but that someone was alerting him to information already made public. Despite claims to the contrary, Trump Jr. was not aware (as far as records prove) ofCNN has published a CORRECTION and updated this story. Originally CNN said the email was dated Sept. 4, based on \"accounts from two sources who had seen the email.\" CNN now has a copy of the email, and it's dated Sept. 14, not Sept. 4. https://t.co/EpvrB43jyU  Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) December 8, 2017From CNN s report, which has been updated to reflect the WaPos findings:Candidate Donald Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr. and others in the Trump Organization received an email in September 2016 offering a decryption key and website address for hacked WikiLeaks documents, according to an email provided to congressional investigators.The September 14 email was sent during the final stretch of the 2016 presidential race.CNN originally reported the email was released September 4   10 days earlier   based on accounts from two sources who had seen the email. The new details appear to show that the sender was relying on publicly available information. The new information indicates that the communication is less significant than CNN initially reported.After this story was published, The Washington Post obtained a copy of the email Friday afternoon and reported that the email urged Trump and his campaign to download archives that WikiLeaks had made public a day earlier. The story suggested that the individual may simply have been trying to flag the campaign to already public documents.CNN has now obtained a copy of the email, which lists September 14 as the date sent and contains a decryption key that matches what WikiLeaks had tweeted out the day before.After obtaining the emails, the WaPo corrected the record:A 2016 email sent to President Trump and top aides pointed the campaign to hacked documents from the Democratic National Committee that had already been made public by the group WikiLeaks a day earlier.The email   sent the afternoon of Sept. 14, 2016   noted that  Wikileaks has uploaded another (huge 678 mb) archive of files from the DNC  and included a link and a  decryption key,  according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post.The writer, who said his name was Michael J.

A one-party communist state suppresses virtually all forms of political dissent, using a broad array of repressive measures. Freedom of expression, association and assembly are tightly controlled. The police routinely use torture and beatings to extract confessions and punish detainees. Religious minorities and activists are harassed, intimidated and imprisoned. The criminal justice system lacks independence and operates under the direction of the government and party. State-run drug rehabilitation centers exploit detainees as forced laborers making goods for local markets and export. Despite the pressure, increasing numbers of courageous bloggers and activists are vocal in calling for democracy and greater freedoms.A coalition of 14 human rights groups strongly condemns the Feb. 2014 decision by an appeals court upholding a 30-month prison sentence for Vietnamese human rights lawyer and blogger Le Quoc Quan. Mr. Quan has been detained since December 2012.The groups believe Mr. Quan s detention is politically motivated and a reaction to his blog, where he frequently exposes human rights violations by the Vietnamese government. Mr. Quan is a victim of a coordinated government crackdown on bloggers, citizen journalists and pro-democracy activists.Meanwhile President Barack Obama met Tuesday with Vietnamese communist party leader Nguy n Ph  Tr ng in the hopes of strengthening ties between the two nations. The President also welcomes the opportunity to discuss other issues, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, human rights, and bilateral defense cooperation,  the White House said in a statement.The meeting came nearly four decades after the Vietnam War. Since that time, the two countries have made efforts to improve diplomatic relations. In just the past two years, Obama has met with Vietnam s President Tr ng T n Sang and Prime Minister Nguy n T n D ng. Like in any relations between two countries in the world, Vietnam and the U.S. have differences on a number of issues, such as perception on democracy, human rights and trade,  Tr ng wrote, according to NPR.

        "text": "There are conflicting reports about why the outrageous Omarosa Manigault Newman is leaving her undefined job at the White House. It was first reported that she was escorted out of the White House by Secret Service after General Kelly had enough of her nonsense, and fired her. Omarosa appeared on Good Morning America the following day to refute those claims, saying she resigned from her job and was not fired or escorted out of the White House as reported. So who is Omarosa, and why is she such a polarizing figure? Does this 2006 video that just emerged offer any clues?A pop-culture polymath sent Page Six a link to  Soul Sistahs,  an ultra-camp, hyper-kitsch, uber-low-budget 10-minute sci-fi short film.While the plot is virtually incomprehensible, as far as we can tell it focuses on an intergalactic yenta in a housecoat who kidnaps Omarosa in an attempt to steal Donald Trump s hair as part of a difficult-to-understand get-rich-quick scheme.The mini-flick was made back in 2006   two years after Omarosa shot to fame on Trump s NBC show  The Apprentice. In this vaguely  Barbarella -inspired work, the aging villain drugs Omarosa by feeding her spiked cake, whereupon the red PVC-clad former director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison goes off on a motorcycle to steal the future president s hair in a showdown on top of a CGI-created Trump Tower.The film, which has been viewed a mere 6,000 times   as our source put it:  It s a cult classic.

In addition, CNN threatened to expose the Reddit user s identity in future if it disapproved of his behavior or his statements   essentially blackmailing him:Now, CNN has been accused of both threatening and blackmailing the creator of the wrestling meme.CNN s KFile  discovered the real identity of the Reddit user credited with creating the meme, HanA**holeSolo, and tried to contact him. The meme creator then apologized on Reddit, saying he doesn t advocate violence against the media. According to CNN, he then got in touch with KFile and asked not to be named. CNN also said that it would not publish the man s name, because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology,  and that CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change. As a result of the controversy, the hashtag #CNNBlackmail has been trending on Twitter.The online backlash has been hard and swift, as thousands of Tweets reveal the scale of public distaste for CNN:\"CNN: The Most Trusted Name In Silencing Political Dissent\"#CNNBlackmail pic.twitter.com/w0Lpl2ZGc2  Wrongthink Warlord (@NoSlackDelta) July 5, 2017If anyone tried to do what CNN just did on reddit, twitter or almost any online community   they would get instanstly banned. #CNNBlackmail pic.twitter.com/JbtRNPDUYK  Murad Gazdiev (@MuradGazdiev) July 5, 2017CNN tracks a 15 year old meme maker down in a few days but can't prove Russia conspiracy in over a year. #CNNBlackmail  Randy Newton (@threezeroleft) July 5, 2017It s no surprise that CNN reputation has been steadily tanking following a string of fake news reports regarding President Trump and Russia, along with some of the most abysmal journalism ever seen in modern times during its coverage of the 2016 election where it openly backed the eventual loser, Hillary Clinton, as well as continuous bogus reporting coming out of Syria where CNN has repeatedly laid the false claim that,  Assad is gassing his own people.

        "title": " Priceless: Yelpers Review The Moron Militia Occupied Oregon Wildlife Preserve (IMAGES)",
        "text": "When the right-wing terrorists took over the Malheur National Wildlife Preserve, the first thought many had was of the guy pointing his weapon at a BLM agent from between Jersey barriers when the Cliven Bundy incident happened. When we learned that it was Bundy s own sons leading the charge to free a remote corner of Southeast Oregon from oppression, those fears were multiplied.Then something magical happened. Within hours we learned that the  occupation  would be a gathering of nitwits the likes of John Ritzheimer who were too stupid to bring enough supplies to feed themselves for a camping trip, never mind a  standoff  that Ammon Bundy said would last years.We learned that the desperate plea for snacks was foolish not only because these were supposed to be those survivalists we all hear about being prepared for the zombie apocalypse but because the local authorities suggested they just go to the store since nobody was watching them.The frightening became stupid and then completely ludicrous. Now what we have left is a group of armed idiots in a standoff with nobody occupying a taxpayer-funded retreat in a bird sanctuary, threatening to give the land back to the loggers. It was never going to go over well.At least we can laugh. If nothing else the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom have provided the internet with enough material for memes by the truckload, humor articles, op-eds and satire pieces for miles and enough YouTube parodies to last the winter if you re bored enough to watch them all.One of the most enjoyable reads you ll have during this debacle has to be Yelp, where  reviewers  have gone out of their way to make your tour of the preserve a memorable one. From large Cheeto-begging mammals spotted on the trails to toothless creatures in need of our support and protection, yelpers have made the incredibly ridiculous world of the Bundy Moron Militia even more absurd   and it is magnificent.Here are some images of the best Yelp has to offer. Enjoy! Toss in a few funny pictures for good measure and the humiliation of Ammon Bundy ands friends is just about complete: You can visit the comments HERE. Yelp has been cleaning them as they come in, as their policy is to not take a political stance on anything, but new ones are popping up all the time.

        "text": "21st Century Wire says Is Washington preparing to carpet bomb Raqqa? If so, what will be the  trigger  for this boldly adroit military maneuver to deploy B-52 Bombers to the Middle East?Back in Dec 2015, GOP contender Ted Cruz vowed he would  carpet bomb ISIS  if elected president (and to hell with any collateral damage). He recently repeated that call on FOX network s Kelly File show. If I am elected president, we will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will utterly destroy ISIS,  he said.  And yes that means carpet bombing them into oblivion.  But it s not Cruz ramping up the Pentagon s military footprint   it s Barack Obama who is the international aggressor, but he s  leading from behind  safely in the background in order to preserve his party s fast-diminishing dovish allure in a delicate election year.Regardless, the U.S. are desperate to save face in the Middle East after 5 years of failed policy and arming terrorists in Syria and northern Iraq while acting as if they were forming a Coalition to defeat the terrorists   a totally fraudulent narrative (yes, you read that correctly, and the evidence is now in).Is this a sign of thing to come..?In a conventional conflict, the B-52 can perform air interdiction, offensive counter-air and maritime operations. During Desert Storm, B-52s delivered 40 percent of all the weapons dropped by coalition forces. It is highly effective when used for ocean surveillance, and can assist the U.S. Navy in anti-ship and mine-laying operations. Two B-52s, in two hours, can monitor 140,000 square miles (364,000 square kilometers) of ocean surface. All B-52s are equipped with an electro-optical viewing system that uses platinum silicide forward-looking infrared and high resolution low-light-level television sensors to augment the targeting, battle assessment, flight safety and terrain-avoidance system, thus further improving its combat ability and low-level flight capability. (U.S. Air Force photo) RTAmerican B-52 Stratofortress bombers have been sent for their first Middle East operational deployment since the 1991 Gulf War 26 years ago. The aircraft are flying from Qatar to bomb Islamic State targets.An undisclosed number of B-52s have arrived at the Al Udeid Air Base on Sunday, the US Air Force said. The B-52 will provide the coalition continued precision and deliver desired airpower effects, Lt. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., commander, US Air Forces Central Command said in the statement.The B-52 is a long-range multi-purpose heavy bomber. The Central Command last used them during Operation Desert Storm against Saddam Hussein s Iraq, when the aircraft flew sorties from Saudi Arabia.The deployment is meant to replace a contingent of B-1 Lancer swing-wing bombers which departed the Middle East in January for maintenance and a series of upgrades, the US Army s Stars and Stripes reported. The B-52 demonstrates our continued resolve to apply persistent pressure on Daesh and defend the region in any future contingency,  Brown said, referring to Islamic State by its Arabic-language acronym.The deployment comes shortly after Russia used its long-range Tupolev Tu-22, Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers to strike terrorist targets in Syria. The Russian aircraft flew from their home bases over the Caspian Sea, Iran and Iraq to reach the Syrian territory.READ MORE PENTAGON NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Pentagon Files",

        "text": "Kellyanne Conway went at it with Anderson Cooper and came out on top when she basically schooled Cooper on the chain of command in government. The facts make no sense to him because he s in denial. Conway said Trump s decision to fire James Comey had nothing to do with the FBI s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. She goes on to explain to Cooper that the letter recommending that Comey be fired was sent to President Trump. Was Trump supposed to then deny the Assistant Attorney General s decision? It s good to note that the Assistant AG was just confirmed by over 90% of the Senate. He s a bipartisan choice and a well respected man who came into his position under AG Jeff Sessions just two weeks ago. The letter sent to Trump summarized the numerous things that prove the case for the recommendation of firing Comey. TRUMP DID NOT DO THIS ALONE But you have the fake news media beating the RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA drums over and over.Watch how Kellyanne Conway runs circles around Anderson Cooper while Cooper just keeps coming back to the Russia scenario: It s not a cover up. The president makes it very clear in his letter. Comey assured him he s not under investigation. I think you re looking at wrong set of facts here. You re going back to the campaign. This man is president of the United States. He acted decisively today. You want this to be about Russia when this is about restoring public confidence in the FBI The FBI director reports to deputy attorney general, the deputy attorney general reports to the attorney general and the attorney general reports to the president of the United States. This has nothing to do with Russia. It has everything to do with whether the current FBI director has the president s confidence and can faithfully and capably execute his duties. ",

        "title": "KARMA: Race-Obsessed Detroit Free Press Editorial Editor Who Led Effort To Destroy Kid Rock\u2019s Career Is FIRED Over Allegations of Inappropriate Behavior With Female Colleagues",
        "text": "In September 2016, Stephen Henderson, the editorial editor of the Detroit Free Press, used the power of his pen to unjustly attack Kid Rock, after liberals feared Rock might actually be serious about running as a Republican contender against the do-nothing Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow. As a Michigan resident, I can say with a great level of confidence, that besides Mike Illitch, the now deceased owner of the Red Wings and Detroit Tigers, Kid Rock has done more for the city of Detroit and for the black community than almost anyone in this state. When the Illitch s asked Detroit legend and philanthropist, Kid Rock to perform for the opening of their much anticipated Little Caesar s Arena, no one could have dreamed that the Detroit Free Press  Stephen Henderson would have used his position to push a lie, that Kid Rock, the single father of a black son, and NAACP award recipient is a  racist .Here s what Henderson had to say about Kid Rock, the man who has done so much for the city of Detroit:This is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music, who used to wrap his brand in the Confederate flag   a symbol inextricably linked to racism, no matter what its defenders say   and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of African Americans pushing back against American inequality. Just last week, he trashed Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent, kneeling protest during the pre-football game singing of the national anthem. Having Kid Rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to Detroiters   nothing less. And the Ilitches, who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it, should be the last to embrace that kind of signaling.Here is how Kid Rock responded on his Facebook page:People! Pay NO attention to the garbage the extreme left is trying to create! (and by the way, fuck the extreme left and the extreme right!)They are trying to use the old confederate flag BS, etc. to stir the pot, when we all know none of this would be going on if I were not thinking of running for office. Pretty funny how scared I have them all and their only agenda is to try and label people / me racist who do not agree or cower to them!! No one had a word to say when we sold out the 6 shows at LCA back in January! My track record in Detroit and Michigan speaks for itself, and I would dare anyone talking trash to put theirs up against mine. I am also a homeowner and taxpayer in the city of Detroit, so suck on that too!I am the bona fide KING OF DETROIT LOVE and it makes me smile down deep that you haters know that! Your jealousy is merely a reflection of disgust for your own failures and lack of positive ideas for our city.I am however very disappointed that none of the people, businesses or charities I have so diligently supported in Detroit have had anything to say about all these unfounded attacks from these handful of jackasses and The Detroit Free Press. So for the unforeseen future I will focus my philanthropy efforts on other organizations besides the ones I have supported in the past. I would however employ that NAN go ahead and make up these losses since they claim to be so good for Detroit and do not want me opening the arena and generating tons of jobs and tax dollars for the city and people I LOVE  IDIOTS!  .. (Has Al Sharpton even paid his back taxes yet?)Today, the race-obsessed Stephen Henderson, got some very bad news AP   The Detroit Free Press fired Stephen Henderson, its managing director of opinion and commentary, after finding what it called credible allegations of inappropriate behavior with female colleagues, the newspaper announced Friday.Free Press Editor and Vice President Peter Bhatia announced Henderson s termination in a story that said the allegations go back several years. Gannett Co. Inc., the newspaper s parent company, says Henderson s behavior  has been inconsistent with company values and standards. Henderson said in a statement to The Detroit News and Crain s Detroit Business that he is  stunned. I dedicated 18 years to this newspaper over three decades, all of it performing at the highest level,  Henderson said.  I may have more to say on this later, but for now there is much other work to be done here in the city of Detroit. Stephen is a magnificent journalist and a treasured colleague who has done so much for Detroit,  Bhatia said. He added there were no accusations of sexual assault, but said the incidents involving inappropriate behavior and comments directed at Free Press employees ran counter to company policies.Less than 2 months ago, Henderson appeared on Meet The Press and called America a racist nation with a racist history:Rich Lowry of the National Review appeared with Stephen Henderson on Meet The Press to discuss Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players who disrespect the flag as a way to support Black Lives Matter. Henderson argued,  Some of the words in the national anthem are racist.  Henderson argued that it was appropriate to show disrespect for the American flag because he thinks America is a country whose history is racist. Henderson told the panel,  I think this is a country whose history is racist, whose history is steeped in white supremacy, and the anthem reflects that in its very words   (inaudible) . Lowry responded to Henderson by saying,  It s also a nation with very important ideals that have worn down those injustices over time and created a more just society. And people have died under that flag for those ideals. Watch:",

        "text": "The only time Republicans want to actually help people is when it will help them, too. Rep. David Jolly (R-FL) is well aware of this, and being from Florida, he s understandably angry about the House s refusal to pass funding to combat Zika. So he decided to try and make his obstructive, intransigent colleagues understand the crisis   by threatening to release 100 mosquitoes from Florida onto the House floor.He also berated them for their utter selfishness: I brought these mosquitoes today to convey that fear and that anxiety of millions of Americans, of Floridians. Can you imagine the fear and anxiety in this chamber if these mosquitoes were outside this jar, not inside this jar.Members of Congress would run down the hall to the physician s office to be tested. They would spray themselves before coming down here. This is the fear of Floridians! Right here! The House is interested in defunding Planned Parenthood to the point where they stick that legislation in everything, hoping that putting it in an otherwise must-pass bill will lead to getting rid of the organization altogether. They do this even when doing so is totally irrelevant, and actually damaging, to the very real problems Americans face.Like Zika, in Florida. Watch him go at the rest of the House below:Democrats actually blocked the bill, but they did so because of provisions on Planned Parenthood, the fact that it would rob the ACA of needed funding, and the fact that it was nearly $1 billion less than the Obama administration had requested. Furthermore, the Senate passed a bi-partisan Zika bill of its own that the House wouldn t vote on. Republicans love to play this game so they can blame Democrats for obstruction.The truth is, if they d just pass a clean bill like grown-ups, then we d have a lot more governing and a lot less of this.In fact, Paul Ryan said that when it came time for House and Senate negotiators to act, it was Democrats who refused. He left out one teensy, tiny little detail when he blasted them about it   the fact that Republican negotiators insisted the bill must carry a provision blocking funding for a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Puerto Rico.Since January, Zika has spread to 13 states, likely exists in far more, and is at crisis levels in Florida. 84 pregnant women have been diagnosed with the virus, and there are probably hundreds more who are currently undiagnosed. As of just a few days ago, there were 614 known cases total in Florida. There were 210 known cases in California.With this, one would hope that Republicans could put their politics aside and pass a clean bill to address the crisis, and then go back to playing politics if they must. Vice President Biden actually went straight to Congress to ask them to stop playing games. From Reuters: Give us an up-or-down vote, straight, on Zika,  Biden said at an event on Capitol Hill with fellow Democrats from the Senate and House of Representatives. I understand attaching controversial issues to important legislation   but this is a national emergency,  Biden added.  People s health, the well-being of unborn children, the health of the country at large, is at stake. Act. Republicans don t care, so Jolly decided to try and force them to care by threatening them with Zika to see how they d react. He decided to try and instill the fear that his state feels over the virus. It s unclear if the gambit worked, though. If it doesn t, then the situation is just more proof that the GOP isn t actually pro-life (because if they were, this would have been a done deal long ago), and also that they couldn t give two craps about helping anybody.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",

        "text": "After a completely unhinged speech in Florida in which Trump claimed President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founder and co-founder of the terrorist group ISIS, the media rightfully hounded him for his stupidity.And what did he do? He doubled down, this time using literal terms.When Hugh Hewitt, on his conservative talk-radio show, tried to clarify Trump s statement, the Republican presidential nominee doubled down and told the host that Barack Obama, in his official capacity as President of the United States, literally created ISIS:Hugh Hewitt: I ve got two more questions. Last night you said the President was the founder of ISIS. I know what you meant. You meant that he created the vacuum, he lost the peace.Trump: No, I meant he s the founder of ISIS. I do. He was the most valuable player. I gave him the most valuable player award. I gave her too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.Hugh Hewitt: But he s not sympathetic to them. He hates them. He s trying to kill them.Trump: I don t care, he was the founder. His, the way he got out of Iraq was that that was the founding of ISIS, okayAnd just like that, Trump resorted back to his typical dog whistle insanity that won him the nomination of the crazy party. In Hewitt s defense, he did warn Trump that such comments would welcome even more media scrutiny that would hurt his chances of winning over independent voters.But Trump doesn t care. He says he s made  no mistake  in pinning the  founder  label on President Obama.Politifact fact-checked two claims from Donald Trump when he tried to tie Clinton and Obama to ISIS exclusively, and both times it was discovered Trump was   shocker   a big fat liar.Regardless, facts are no match for the red-meat politics Trump likes to throw to his rabid supporters.Luckily no one is believing him, and no matter how much he tries to push the narrative, he can t get out of the 40 percent zone with polling.Democrats are loving the Trump implosion.

Sanders then spoke to a large crowd about his time listening to the stories of immigrants and the need to create a  reality-based  immigration policy that puts compassion first. As I have traveled around this country and talked to immigrant families, and particularly Latino immigrant families, I am struck by the fear and sadness that grips so many of them,  Sanders said following the visit.  Fathers or mothers or both sent out of the country having to leave their minor children with relatives or guardians here in the United States. A U.S. service member whose spouse was deported. A 12-year-old boy who longs to be reunited with his mother. This human suffering has got to end. That is why I am here today. During the event, Sanders delivered blistering remarks aimed towards Donald Trump and the Republican presidential candidate s incredulous plan to build a giant border wall. The most bizarre part of Trump s plan is to have the construction of this wall be paid for by the Mexican government. Sanders calls out Trump s bigoted remarks against Mexicans, including the time Trump implied that immigrants from Mexico are rapists. I would hope that all of us are rightly appalled by the divisive bigoted and xenophobic comments of people like Donald Trump. Trump s labeling of Mexicans as rapists and criminals repulses all Americans of good will. Mexico is our neighbor, which we have extremely important relations with. To insult an entire nation is not befitting of anybody, let alone a candidate for president of the United States. Citing Pope Francis, Sanders said that Pope Francis has said we should be building more bridges, not more walls. Pope Francis is right.

The discrimination against Americans is very real and it s about time the workers fought back!Some U.S. IT workers who have been replaced with H-1B contractors are alleging discrimination and are going to court. They are doing so in increasing numbers.There are at least seven IT workers at Disney who are pursuing, or plan to pursue, federal and state discrimination administrative complaints over their layoffs. Another Disney worker, still employed by the firm, has filed a state administrative discrimination complaint in California. These complaints are a first step to litigation.Separately, there are ongoing court cases alleging discrimination against two of the largest India-based IT services firms, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services. The federal judges in each of cases have given a green light for the plaintiffs to proceed after rejecting dismissal efforts.There may be federal interest in examining this issue. The U.S. Department of Justice s Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices was asked by 10 U.S. senators in April to examine the IT layoffs at Southern California Edison (SCE) and to determine whether SCE or its contractors were  engaged in prohibited citizenship status discrimination. What s being challenged, in sum, is the job replacement system created by the H-1B program. U.S. IT workers, as a condition for their severance, are being made to train H-1B visa-holding contractor replacements to take over their jobs.The contractors often work for IT services firms that employ large numbers of H-1B workers. Most of these workers are from India and regional countries. This practice of replacing U.S. workers with foreign workers constitutes national origin discrimination, say its critics.The court case against Tata, whose plaintiffs include a former SCE employee, alleges that some 95% of its employees are South Asian or mostly Indian. Tata has called the allegations baseless.The Disney IT workers  were terminated because they were American citizens and all their replacements were foreign-born Indians,  said Sara Blackwell, a Florida attorney, who is representing seven of the Disney workers at its parks and resort division. She has set up an organizationto challenge the practice. Other discrimination claims, including age and disability, will be made as well. Those complaints are being filed with the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission, which sees if a settlement is possible prior to any lawsuit.Disney did not respond immediately for comment. We need to protect American workers,  said James Otto, a California attorney who is representing a Disney ABC Television Group employee in that state. This complaint is being filed in California under the state s Fair Employment and Housing Act, which Otto said is similar to the federal process, but with more protections.Otto s client still works at Disney and had been targeted for an earlier layoff, but Disney rescinded those layoffs. Nonetheless, the complaints being made include a hostile workforce and national origin discrimination.Read more: Computer World",

        "text": "Author Ed Klein told Pete Hegseth on Fox and Friends Weekend that Barack Obama is setting up a shadow government in Washington DC to undermine President Trump after Inauguration Day. Does Obama have plans to work with the underbelly of the Democrat Party to disrupt Trump s term as President?But could the left really attempt a violent revolution to overthrow the U.S. government and overturn the American way of life?Not only could they, but they will try, according to Douglas V. Gibbs, who has appeared as a commentator on Fox News and is a radio talk-show host in Los Angeles.And it won t be a liberal revolution. It will be a communist revolution.That s the prediction Gibbs made in an article published Friday in the Canada Free Press titled,  Democrats Prepare for Violent Revolution. Examining the evidence, he concludes a revolution attempt is not necessarily imminent, but that it will happen, once various pieces fall into place.Gibbs declared,  They are in full preparation for social and economic collapse, or a violent revolution. He cites the website DisruptJ20 and its  Call for a bold mobilization against the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2017. Gibbs quotes Michael Moore explaining,  It is their goal to  block, obstruct, disrupt, and do whatever they can to prevent the onslaught that is going to happen with Donald Trump. .It is Gibbs  contention that,  The liberal leftists want desperately to sabotage the Trump administration, and possibly overthrow the entire government. For their socialist big government agenda, the ends justifies the means. Why now?Because, he explained,  [U]nder Obama, the veil was raised. Why worry about exposure now? They ve been poking the right-of-center groups in the chest for years, trying to instigate a violent response, and they never got it. Now,  he continued,  they may be realizing, it is up to them to initiate the violence. It is up to the leftists to finally launch the true coup. Or, at least that is what a lot of people think. Evidence that could support his theory is not hard to come by, as the left is becoming increasingly violent.During the 2016 presidential campaign, leftist riots broke out in cities across the country, the worst perhaps in San Jose, California, and in Chicago.WND reported assassination threats against Trump accompanied the nationwide rioting.Often-violent anti-Trump protests broke out in cities including Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Denver, Minneapolis, Baltimore, Seattle, Tampa, Dallas and Oakland, California.In Chicago, a video showed a mob of young black men beating and dragging through the streets a white man who voted for Trump.Portland, Oregon police termed a protest a riot after  anarchists  threw objects at officers, vandalized local businesses and damaged cars.Some 1,000 protesters in Oakland broke store windows, left graffiti on buildings and threw M-80 firecrackers, Molotov cocktails and bottles at police officers, authorities told CNN.And that s only the beginning, if Gibbs is right.He suggests the left will inevitably move on to more violence following the election of Trump, because  the realization that the Democrats are losing grip on their transformational agenda in the rest of the country has slammed the leftists square in the face. Gibbs asserts the leftists  hate any opposition, and are willing to do whatever it takes to either win over their opposition, or silence and eliminate their opposition. The next step by the left, according to Gibbs, is the stockpiling of arms. Now, it s the liberals who are suddenly worried, and stockpiling food, guns, and emergency supplies,  he observed.  Trump s 2016 win was a wake-up call. Their cheating, lying and violence was not enough to stop the man, and his very unorthodox approach to politics. Gibbs sees the left s hysteria as now having gone beyond insanity, marking a transition to violent anger.He believes the hysteria arose because the left they thought they had finally defeated the right permanently with the election of Obama, and that the election of Hillary Clinton would seal the deal. They only needed, now, to disarm the crazy right-wing bastards,  wrote Gibbs.  Then, with a faint whimper, the last of the opposition to the liberal left agenda would be gone. It seemed to them a near-certainty, but when it all came crashing down on Nov. 8, it was a disorienting  shock to the system. Nobody on the left side of the aisle expected that Trump had a snowball s chance in Hell to win the 2016 Election. All of their skewed poll numbers said Hillary was going to win. Gibbs portrayed the left as in a state similar to post-traumatic stress disorder.For entire story: WND ",

This is more than just about Trump winning, it s about Trump doing the job the media should have been doing to expose Hillary Clinton as an accomplice to her perverted husband for decades Fresh from using the  R  word during a recent sit-down with Sean Hannity, Donald Trump on Monday released on Instagram a new campaign ad against Hillary Clinton featuring the voice of Bill Clinton s rape accuser, Juanita Broaddrick. He starts to bite on my top lip and I try to pull away from him,  Broaddrick is heard saying in the brief ad.

Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on May 23, 2016 at 8:27am PDTYou gotta love the cackle at the end The Broaddrick audio comes from an emotional interview that she gave to NBC s Dateline in 1999 describing the alleged rape.Broaddrick says Clinton raped her at a hotel when she was a nursing home administrator volunteering for then-Arkansas Attorney General Bill Clinton s 1978 gubernatorial bid.She told NBC s Dateline that she resisted when Clinton suddenly kissed her:Then he tries to kiss me again. And the second time he tries to kiss me he starts biting my lip   He starts to, um, bite on my top lip and I tried to pull away from him. And then he forces me down on the bed. And I just was very frightened, and I tried to get away from him and I told him  No,  that I didn t want this to happen but he wouldn t listen to me.   It was a real panicky, panicky situation. I was even to the point where I was getting very noisy, you know, yelling to  Please stop.  And that s when he pressed down on my right shoulder and he would bite my lip.   When everything was over with, he got up and straightened himself, and I was crying at the moment and he walks to the door, and calmly puts on his sunglasses. And before he goes out the door he says  You better get some ice on that.  And he turned and went out the door. In an interview with this reporter last week, Broaddrick was asked to comment on the statements made by Trump at a campaign stop earlier this month, where the presidential candidate slammed Hillary Clinton as  unbelievably nasty, mean enabler  who  destroyed  the lives of her husband s mistresses and alleged victims.Broaddrick replied:  I feel like she has been the enabler behind him in allowing him to continue on the same path that he did back in the  70s and  80s and  90s. He has absolutely no morals when it comes to women. Via: Breitbart News",

Trump says his words weren t strong enough. Maybe it wasn t tough enough,  the president told reporters on Thursday at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J.  It s about time someone stuck up for the people of our country. Source: PoliticoNorth Korea s leader, Kim Jong Un, the other petulant man-child in this pissing match, hasn t yet responded, but he has twice, as a response to Trump s  fire and fury  threat, threatened to nuke Guam.The intelligence community believes that North Korea has developed a miniaturized nuclear warhead that is small enough to fit into a long-range missile, leading to speculation that if Kim John Un wanted to attack the United States, he could.Even Trump s own White House is conflicted on how to handle it, though. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has tried to mitigate Trump s irresponsible and irrational threat. Nothing that I have seen and nothing that I know of would indicate that the situation has dramatically changed in the last 24 hours,  he said, adding that  Americans should sleep well at night. But he also defended Trump s comments. I think what the President was doing was sending a strong message to North Korea in language that Kim Jong Un would understand, because he doesn t seem to understand diplomatic language,  Tillerson said. Source: CNNTrump advisor Sebastion Gorka quickly refuted Tillerson, saying: You should listen to the president; the idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical,  Gorka said in a recording shared with The Washington Post.  It is the job of Secretary Mattis, the secretary of defense, to talk about the military options, and he has done so unequivocally. He said,  Woe betide anyone who militarily challenges the United States,  and that is his portfolio. That is his mandate. Secretary Tillerson is the chief diplomat of the United States, and it is his portfolio to handle those issues. Mattis is hoping for diplomacy, but he s ready to go to war at any moment.Even if Trump is blowing smoke up Kim Jong Un s posterior, this is a dangerous line of talk, especially when dealing with a mentally unstable narcissist with daddy issues. Then we have to worry about North Korea.Read more:Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",

San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has refused to participate in any FEMA meetings regarding aid to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, has continually accused the Trump administration of not helping out in Puerto Rico s time of need, going so far as to claim the federal government is  killing  Puerto Ricans.Fox News  Geraldo Rivera went down to Puerto Rico and actually confronted Cruz about her statement that people are  dying  because of the Trump administration s  inefficiency and bureaucracy. But are people dying? I ve been traveling around, I don t see people dying,  Rivera challenging Cruz said.  I spoke to the doctors, they say they saw 53 patients and they had a person who was septic, but nobody dying. Dying is a continuum,  Cruz said in response.  If you don t get fed for seven, eight days and you re a child, you are dying. If you have 11 people like we took out of a nursing home, severely dehydrated, you are dying. Of course dying is a continuum. Everyone eventually dies. It s an unfortunate part of life. But, when it comes to Puerto Ricans dying from neglect and a lack of supplies, Rivera wasn t buying it. The death count was 16 a week ago. It remains 16 today,  Rivera said.  People are not dying. Here s the video of Rivera s interview with Cruz:Backing up Rivera s claims, an article released on Sunday by the Daily Mail said that a Puerto Rican woman claiming to be a police officer alleged that Cruz and Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello have been holding back supplies  in order to make for better photo opportunities.

        "text": "Students in Idaho are one vote away from having the Bible shoved down their throats in every subject in school.The Republican-dominated Senate education committee voted to advance Senate Bill 1321, which would permit the use of the Bible by teachers in classrooms across the state for a wide variety of subjects.According to the bill,The Bible is expressly permitted to be used in Idaho public schools for reference purposes to further the study of literature, comparative religion, English and foreign languages, United States and world history, comparative government, law, philosophy, ethics, astronomy, biology, geology, world geography, archaeology, music, sociology, and other topics of study where an understanding of the Bible may be useful or relevant. No student will be required to use any religious texts for reference purposes if the student or parents of the student object.Bill sponsor state Sen. Sheryl Nuxoll said her bill is to protect teachers because they are  scared to use the Bible  in their classrooms.And they should be scared to do so. The Bible has no place in most of the subjects mentioned and would not provide any useful information that would enhance the facts being taught, especially in science classes.The Bible s role in world history is indisputable but reading from the Bible is totally unnecessary to make that point.Clearly, this is an effort by conservative  Christians  to sneak Bible reading into schools to indoctrinate students. And it s unlikely that many students will feel free to object since teachers and other students can be bullies when it comes to religious fervor. There s also the question of whether school officials would actually properly inform students of their rights or whether school officials would actually inform parents that the Bible is being used in their child s classes.Make no mistake, this bill would allow conservative  Christian  teachers to force creationism upon their students in science class as a viable alternative to evolution. It would also allow teachers to tell students that God causes natural disasters to punish us while using the Bible as proof, not to mention the way the Bible could be used in history classes to teach that America was founded as a Christian nation even though the facts say otherwise.The bottom line is that the only institution the Bible belongs in is the church, but clearly, conservatives are so desperate to keep their dying religious beliefs alive that they are willing to blatantly violate separation of church and state to do it, even if it means making Idaho kids the worst educated in America.Featured Image: Berkeley",

        "text": "Merrick Garland, President Obama s choice to replace recently deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, has a long record of public service as a judge and a lawyer. But his role in prosecuting the perpetrator of the worst domestic terror attack in American history stands out on his resume.Judge Garland was one of the lead prosecutors in the case of right-wing militia member Timothy McVeigh, who blew up the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995.Friends and former colleagues say that the Oklahoma City case in particular had a lasting emotional impact on Mr. Garland. At the time, he was the second-ranking figure in the office of the deputy attorney general, Jamie S. Gorelick, a job with broad responsibilities over the entire department. But, Ms. Gorelick recalled, he insisted that she send him to Oklahoma City to help begin the investigation in person. He not only volunteered,  Ms. Gorelick recalled,  he basically said,  You need to let me go.   The New York Times reports that once on the ground in Oklahoma, Judge Garland  worked tirelessly to help run the investigation  while  overseeing search warrants, interacting with other law enforcement agencies and meeting with surviving victims. Judge Garland discusses his work on the case and getting justice for the victims in a video released by the White House discussing his background.Garland eventually helped to select the trial team that prosecuted McVeigh in court, and supervised the case.In June of 1997, McVeigh was convicted of the bombing, which killed 168 people (including 19 children at a daycare center). He was sentenced to death and after spending 4 years in federal prison, McVeigh was executed via lethal injection in 2001.Despite his successful record in this prosecution (Garland was also involved in the case against the Unabomber), Republicans have so far vowed not to even give the nominee the courtesy of congressional hearings and an  up or down vote  that was given to the most recent nominees offered from both parties.Democrats have signaled that they plan to use this unprecedented obstruction in the fall campaign against Republicans in the Senate.Featured image via YouTube",

        "text": "A painting on display at a University of Alaska Anchorage art gallery, which depicts the severed head of President Donald Trump, is sparking debate about free speech rights and whether the image is appropriate for display, at a public institution.The artwork, created by Assistant Professor of Painting Thomas Chung, is part of a faculty art exhibition, at the UAA Fine Arts building.In describing his painting, Chung said,  It s an image of the actor who plays Captain America, and two eagles are sort of screaming into his ears, and he s holding the severed head of Trump, and there s a young Hillary Clinton clinging to his leg. I was reminded of those 80 s rock posters, where there s a woman in tattered clothes clinging to a strong male hero s leg. Chung says the motivation for the painting was his dismay over the results of the presidential election. After Trump was elected, I spent days just weeping. And it was really surprising, because I m not a political person,  Chung said.  I am a social artist. I deal mostly in ideals of culture and global culture, but this election bled into that. The painting has prompted debate on social media and complaints to the university.Paul Berger, a former adjunct professor at UAA, went to see the painting, after a family member saw it on display. Berger posted pictures of the painting on his Facebook page. The painting itself, I kind of found disturbing,  Berger said.  The image itself was very graphic. So from that point of view, and as a father, trying to explain to my children what the artist is trying to say   [it s] difficult. Berger said he supports free speech, but questions whether it is appropriate for display, at a publicly-funded institution. Had the roles been reversed, and it was Obama s head hanging there, I think the outrage would be fantastic,  Berger said.  As a free speech advocate, everyone has a right to express their opinion the way they want to express them. But as a parent and a citizen, there s a discussion. In a university setting, what s appropriate? Chung said he had reservations about putting his painting on display at UAA, because of its political message. I was really torn about putting this piece up a faculty show, because I would never talk about my own political beliefs to my students,  Chung said.  I would never push that upon them and make them feel uncomfortable, and so I wondered to myself if putting up this painting was in a way doing that. But I realized that I feel very strongly about this, and I think even students that might be pro-Trump supporters could benefit from having a conversation with me about why I feel this way   why I painted this. Berger, who describes himself as a political conservative, questions whether a painting, depicting the decapitation of the president, will help civil discourse about politics. Prior to the election, it was important to the opposing side that we accept, move forward, respect our president and respect the rule of law,  Berger said.  As we raise our kids in our schools, we try to teach them and inculcate them in our civics. Paintings like that   I really think   send a strong, powerful, wrong message to children and students. Steven Godfrey, chairman of the Fine Arts Department at UAA, said,  I guess the people are upset about the work that s being shown. If they were taking a class at the university and made art that was considered controversial, no matter what their political or religious bent is, we would do our best to protect them and protect their rights to make that kind of work in the institution, whether it would be a student or faculty. The exhibition that includes the painting is scheduled to remain on display through April 20, in the Kimora Gallery.  KTUUTom Chung was born in New Jersey and grew up in Hong Kong and New York City. He received his Bachelors of Fine Arts Degree from the San Francisco Art Institute in 2010 and his Masters of Fine Arts Degree from Yale University in 2013. He has participated in numerous group and solo shows throughout the United States. His multidisciplinary work has been written about in Art in America, The New Yorker, and Modern Painters Magazine.",

        "text": "We ve been telling you all week to ignore the manufactured polls and lies being told by mainstream  journalists  (of which 65 have been found to be in collusion with Hillary s camp)designed to discourage and deflate Donald Trump supporters. The crowds, the enthusiasm and the fundraising for Trump is on fire, while Hillary and Tim Kaine can barely fill a phone booth with supporters. This SUNY professor has a model that s been working for over 100 years of elections and he s giving the race to Trump The most important thing Trump supporters can do right now, is to reach out to their friends and family and convince them to get out to the polls for Trump. There will undoubtedly be a lot of voter fraud committed by Democrats and it s up to us to help make up that difference with actual voters for Trump.  Donald Trump may be behind in most polls, but one veteran New York prognosticator still predicts he will win come Election Day. I think he was the strongest candidate in the primaries and that he will prevail,  Helmut North, a political science professor at SUNY Stony Brook, told The Post on Monday, even as the RealClearPolitics average shows the Republican candidate trailing Democrat Hillary Clinton by 6.1 percentage points.The sale of halloween masks have also always been correct in predicting the winner of the presidential election. Check out who s winning in sales: Norpoth developed a model that, applied retroactively in earlier races, would have correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election since 1912   with the exception of 2000, when predicted winner Al Gore barely lost to George W. Bush.The model looks at which of the candidates performed better in the primaries and caucuses and concludes that the stronger performer there will enter the White House.   NYP",

        "text": "Undisputed Facts:An Oak Creek woman and her son have been indicted on allegations of stealing $3 million from the federal government through a benefits program intended to help the poor, according to court records.The indictment, released late Wednesday, says the fraud was committed at Family Super Saver store, 2301 W. Hopkins St., from 2009 to 2014. The indictment was handed down by the grand jury Tuesday.Elham M.  Brenda  Abdul Rahim and Ahmad Zaki Abdul Rahim were both indicted on a count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Elham Rahim also was indicted on counts of fraud and unauthorized use of food stamps, while Ahmad Rahim was also indicted on a count of lying to investigators from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.The conspiracy count carries up to 20 years in prison, but the defendants are likely to get much less time in prison under federal sentencing guidelines if they are convicted.Ahmad Rahim said Wednesday he didn t know that he and his mother had been indicted and he denied being involved in any fraud. He said his father, who has since died, used to run the store and he could not account for how he ran the operation.According to the indictment:The Rahims used the store to exchange Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program cards for cash. Through the program, recipients get a debit card. The defendants would swipe the card for a certain amount, say $400, and give half the amount to the recipients in cash and keep the rest. The store would charge the government for the entire $400.Via: jsonline",

        "text": "Throughout the campaign, many have tried defending Trump by saying that he was once a Democrat, so he must secretly be a liberal, or something. Well, Trump s pick for his cabinet are among the most conservative possible, and his pick for Labor Secretary is not only  ber socially conservative, he would probably opt for slave labor if it was an option.Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl s Jr. and Hardee s   you know, that company that has  family values  ads like this one:We don t know if it s a shared love for scantily clad women in semi-pornographic settings that drew Donald Trump to Puzder, but Trump is considering him as Labor Secretary and that s very bad news for labor.In May, Pudzer penned a petulant op-ed in which he said he would replace all his employees with robots if Congress raised the minimum wage. That s right, the so-called populist President Elect wants someone in charge of labor who believes that if you can t dramatically underpay employees, then why have employees at all. Pudzer s salary is upwards of $5 million a year. His employees make somewhere around double the poverty level, assuming they are not parents and are working full time.Oh, it gets worse, a lot worse. Puzder, like many of Trump s picks, is painfully (to the nation) socially conservative. Puzder, in his previous life, was a trial lawyer and as a trial lawyer, he wrote one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws of that time.Puzder isn t completely in lock-step with the isolationist Trump, though. He does support free trade. Puzder s views run contrary to the key part of Trump s platform. Pudzer is for immigration reform, but it sort of seems to depend on who s in office. Pudzer loves the cheap labor that immigrants can provide, but not if President Obama is behind it.Immigration reform requires legislative action, not an executive mandate. On that point, last week, numerous business executives, political leaders and I sent a letter to the Republican members of Congress imploring them to reform our broken immigration system. The letter encourages Congress to pass legislation that  discourages the rising tide of illegal immigration while fixing the unnecessary obstacles that send talented individuals elsewhere and make it harder for American companies to compete, grow and create jobs for American workers. Source: Real Clear PoliticsRegardless, Trump is sending a definite message to the nation, which is that his voters and the working people of America don t matter at all. Trump isn t going to save jobs, but he could help lower wages and Puzder is the perfect person to help do that.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",

        "text": "The Defense Department secretly set up a program ten years ago to investigate unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, at the urging of then-Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, according to new reports.Both The New York Times and the website Politico published stories Saturday revealing the existence of the Pentagon s now-defunct Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.The New York Times said the UFO program began in 2007, while Politico reported in began in 2009.According to the reports, Reid, a Nevada Democrat, helped steer money under the program to a donor s aerospace research company.A Pentagon spokesman said the UFO program ended in 2012, though The New York Times said the Defense Department still investigates potential episodes of unidentified flying objects. The Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program ended in the 2012 timeframe,  Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told Politico.  It was determined that there were other, higher-priority issues that merited funding and it was in the best interest of the DoD to make a change. White added:  The DoD takes seriously all threats and potential threats to our people, our assets, and our mission and takes action whenever credible information is developed. Politico said the program was not classified but few officials knew about it. Reid secured the funding for the program in 2009 with the help of former Hawaii Democratic Sen. Daniel Inouye and former Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, who have both since died.Both outlets said Reid s interest in UFOs was the result of friend, and donor Bob Bigelow, who owns Bigelow Aerospace and has said before he is  absolutely convinced  aliens exist and UFOs have visited Earth.The New York Times said the program had a $22 million annual budget and  most of the money  went to Bigelow s research company, which hired subcontractors and solicited research for the program. I m not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry I got this thing going,  Reid told the newspaper.  I think it s one of the good things I did in my congressional service. I ve done something that no one has done before. Both outlets said the person who ran the program, Luis Elizondo, resigned in October and complained about a lack of interest from top officials about it.   FOX News",

        "text": "Governor Greg Abbott of Texas recently traveled to Israel to kiss the ring of Bibi Netanyahu. While there, he pledged that he will do what he can as Texas  leader to obey Israel s desires and begin working on new ways to re-antagonize Iran.Abbott, like most Republicans, owes his true loyalty to Netanyahu s craving for discord instead of America s effort at peace and cooperation. Abbott pledged to craft laws in Texas to curb the flow of any public funds to Iran. He seeks to accomplish this by banning any state-level investments in Iran or by banning Texas government from doing business with any company that does business in Iran. The second part of that is particularly hypocritical. Republicans have always used terms like  free trade  and the concept of little to no government regulation of business to attack liberals. However, when  free trade  conflicts with the desires of Benjamin Netanyahu   a leader of a foreign nation   there suddenly isn t enough regulation that can be enacted.When asked for an example of how many Texan public dollars flow to Iran, Governor Abbott s office was unable to provide any figures. Without some real data, the impact of Abbott s new laws will be unproven at best, and he would likely have to spend more state money to audit companies to make that determination. Fiscal conservatism at its best Governor Abbott will obviously not be able to single-handedly bring Iran to its knees over new state-level  sanctions,  but the politics on this are clear. Republicans still want to do everything they can to sabotage what is otherwise an incredibly successful and historic win for President Obama on his diplomatic victory with Iran. Being able to show their undying loyalty to a foreign leader in the process is just a nice bonus.Featured image via Flickr",

And the seeds of a Russia collusion story were born, CNN reported. The documents   are consistent with my client s understanding of the purpose of the meeting which was from the beginning and at all times thereafter about her efforts to launch a legislative review of the Magnitsky Act,  Balber told CNN.Goldstone knew the Trumps from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow where he had a client who performed at the pageant.",

Pam Geller is attacking Geraldo Rivera for saying he needs to take a shower after she appears on the network.   pic.twitter.com/tYTvvSX5z8  Thomas Bishop (@bishopk0s) November 2, 2017Remember that Geraldo insulted Geller when she was almost killed by two jihadists in Texas Geller has long been a target of radical Islamists. Her life has been threatened but she keeps up the fight:Pam Geller has been spot on when speaking about the truth of jihadists. She spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about how she feels Hollywood is  in the pocket  of jihadis. Very interesting read and lots to learn from this very brave lady:Pamela Geller has been on a rampage against radical Islam for years, beginning notably in 2010 by spearheading of the opposition to what she called the  Ground Zero Mega Mosque  near the site of the destroyed World Trade Center. Her most recent controversy was the organization of a  Draw the Prophet Muhammad  contest in Texas.At the event, two self-described jihadists shot a security guard before police killed them. Then, on June 2, police killed a knife-wielding Muslim man in Boston whose goal was allegedly to behead Geller in retaliation for the contest. Even though the contest was a major news story, few media outlets published the winning cartoon. Geller s group, American Freedom Defense Initiative, put the image on billboards, 100 of which debuted in St. Louis on Monday with the tagline  Support Free Speech.  She spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about how the (largely hostile) media is portraying these events.Why are you being overly provocative, purposely insulting Muslims?I am not being overly provocative or purposely insulting Muslims. Islamic jihadists, not I, made Muhammad cartoons the flash point for the defense of the freedom of speech when they began killing over them. If we don t stand against them on that point, the only alternative is surrender and submission. I did not make the cartoons a flash point, the jihadis did.But if you just don t insult their prophet, they ll leave you alone, no?No. The death penalty for insulting Muhammad is just one aspect of Sharia. There is much, much more of infidel behavior that violates Sharia. If we refrain from drawing Muhammad, more demands to adhere to other aspects of Sharia will follow. Millions are suffering or have been slaughtered under Islamic Sharia law in Muslim countries. Islamic supremacists mean to impose it in the West.There is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment.  Hate speech  is a subjective judgment. If it were outlawed, the authority with the power to decide what constitutes it would have the power to control the public debate.  If a group will not bear being offended without resorting to violence, that group will rule unopposed while everyone else lives in fear, while other groups curtail their activities to appease the violent group. This results in the violent group being able to tyrannize the others. Cartoons have been used as satire since the beginning of satire   especially in our country   and no one gets a pass. Not the Pope of Rome, president of the United States or Hollywood s biggest movie stars.  If you don t like it, don t look at it, boycott the network that airs it, don t buy the publication, make counter-images, make a million, fine, but you have to adjust to us, not we to you, and if that s too much, don t come here. Threaten violence? Commit violence? The consequences are yours to bear.It seems many media pundits who claim allegiance to the First Amendment aren t persuaded by your arguments.They are afraid of being killed by Islamic jihadists and camouflage their fear and cowardice as  respect  for Islam and Muslims.Are there any TV hosts who have been particularly hostile to you during interviews?Yes. Martha MacCallum, Erin Burnett, Alisyn Camerota, Chris Cuomo   although he let me speak and make my case.How about behind your back?Yes. Bill O Reilly and Laura Ingraham. They said I was insulting the entire religion, one held by our moderate allies such as Egypt and Qatar. They are wrong in assuming that we must submit to Sharia to placate moderates, rather than that moderates need to accept the freedom of speech. Roman Catholics don t like their religion mocked or the mockery of other religions, but Roman Catholics don t kill when their religion is mocked   and so no one talks about  provoking  them or  respecting  them. In any pluralistic society, we have to put up with being offended and even with our core beliefs being mocked. Roman Catholics have learned that. Mormons and others have learned that   look at The Book of Mormon on Broadway. Why must we condescend to Muslims and think they cannot learn that? It s the low expectation of soft bigotry.So this isn t entirely a partisan issue where conservatives stand by you and liberals don t?No. Chris Hayes stuck up for me on MSNBC. This is not a left/right split, it is a free person/slave split.Did any TV host say something that struck you as particularly wrongheaded?They all say I have the right to draw Muhammad but shouldn t out of respect. They don t seem to realize that any surrender on this point will only be seen by the jihadists as a victory and embolden them to make more demands. CNN s Erin Burnett said I relished being the target of a beheading. It s madness. Who self-promotes to get killed?So you re not purposely courting danger, as Burnett and others have insinuated?Of course not. I love life. But I will not live as a slave.Are there any TV hosts you d like to face off with but who won t have you on?Bill O Reilly. I expect he knows he would be shown up.We know about the man arrested who intended to behead you. Any other threats you can share?I have received many threats. The FBI and NYPD are aware of them and on the case.Anyone in Hollywood reach out to you to offer support?No.Should Hollywood care about threats against you?They may think they re exempt, but they aren t. Islamic supremacists will be demanding they adhere to Sharia as well. Of course, most producers already are careful not to show anything that might offend Muslims, including accurate representations of jihad plotting and activity, so Hollywood is mostly already in their pocket. But this is their issue, and the entertainment industry should be on the front lines in the information battle space. The jihadists aren t just coming for me, they are coming for all of us that believe in freedom.So why do you think Hollywood, which routinely claims to push the envelope in its art, hasn t supported you?They re afraid of being ostracized.Your  Draw Muhammad  event certainly got a lot of news coverage. Should mainstream media outlets have published the winning cartoon?Every media outlet should publish the Muhammad cartoons. They can t kill us all. By kowtowing to violent intimidation, they are inviting more of it. Instead, they should be showing that we will all stand together for free speech. If the media had published the Danish cartoons back in 2005, this would never have become an issue. The submission by media, entertainment and academic elites empowered the savages.The Southern Poverty Law Center included you on their list of  hate groups.  Are they right?Of course not. They re the hate group, using that label to demonize and stigmatize all who don t share their hard-left agenda. The SPLC smear machine does not profile jihad groups, but they target and libel patriots, veterans, Tea Party organizations and other groups that work in defense of freedom. They named [Republican presidential contender] Ben Carson as a hate group. That should tell you everything you need to know about them. Their [sympathizers] have violently attacked family groups, and one tried to assassinate Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. And a few months back an SPLC [sympathizer] killed three Muslims in a parking dispute in North Carolina.Email: Paul.Bond@THR.com",

        "text": "Donald Trump s former campaign manager Paul Manafort seems likely to flip on his old boss and it s is scaring the sh*t out of the current occupant of the White House. Manafort s shady past includes owing a fuckton of money to pro-Russian entities, money laundering, working in the Ukraine while investing with a Russian oligarch, along with other dubious business practices. Manafort has very little to lose and everything to gain by flipping on Trump. It was previously revealed that his own daughters hate him because  that money we have is blood money. It s now been reported that it was Manafort who alerted authorities to Donald Trump Jr s meeting with a Russian lawyer, which was also attended by Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. That meeting was set up to gather damaging information on Trump s rival, Hillary Clinton.Bloomberg Politics reports:In fact, Manafort had alerted authorities to a controversial meeting on June 9, 2016, involving Trump s son Donald Jr., other campaign representatives and a Russian lawyer promising damaging information on Hillary Clinton, according to people familiar with the matter. The president and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were dragged into the matter as details repeatedly emerged that contradicted the initial accounts of that meeting.Manafort s business associates also risk being engulfed by the probe.Federal agents conducted a pre-dawn raid late last month at a house owned by Manafort and now the investigation involves his financial interests. It appears that Mueller is going by the wise standard of following the money.Agents were looking for  tax documents and foreign banking records  when they conducted the pre-dawn raid on the morning of July 26. A spokesman for Manafort confirmed the news.Hours before the raid was conducted, Trump fired out a tweet against Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.Immediately after the news broke of the raid on Manafort s home, the National Enquirer, a tabloid which has been in cahoots with Trump for years, predictably tweeted out their latest hit-post,  Donald Trump Advisor Paul Manafort Caught Up In Sick Sex Scandal!

        "text": "Donald Trump must be squirming in his tightie-whities as the investigation into his administration s collusion with Russia heats up because he just tweeted one of the absolute dumbest things he has said in quite a while   that the investigation should shift to President Obama because his administration uncovered Vladimir Putin s verified plot (complete with direct instructions) to install Trump in the Oval Office. Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling, why no action?  Trump tweeted on Saturday.  Focus on them, not T!

They didn't want to hurt Hillary?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2017It is true that the Obama administration was completely aware of what was going on. That s why the President expelled numerous suspected Russian spies who were aiding the operation from within our borders, considered harsh sanctions, and set up  the digital equivalent of bombs that could be detonated if the US found itself in an escalating exchange with Moscow  that would cripple Russia s economy. Unfortunately, President Obama left it up to Trump to push the button and he s only just getting around to admitting that Russia   not  someone sitting on their bed weighing 400 pounds  was behind the interference in our election.Naturally, the fine folks on Twitter came to the rescue, attempting to save Trump from somehow growing a third foot for the express purpose of shoving it in his mouth with the other two by correcting him and mocking him in an effort to cause him to feel shame for the first time in his miserable life:Donald was informed of the Russian attack during his campaign and did nothing but ride the wave into the White House.#NiceTryTrump  val broeksmit (@BikiniRobotArmy) June 24, 2017You re an idiot.

In 2015, a message was put out by the group calling for  total war  against the terrorist group. Since then, it has been reported that hackers have taken down tens of thousands of ISIS Twitter accounts. They also took down a major ISIS website and replaced it with an advertisement for Viagra.Omar Marteen, the gunman responsible for the massacre in Orlando, called 911 just before he went on a shooting spree where he pledged allegiance to ISIS. Investigators have yet to release information as to whether was actually responsible for the attack as they have claimed to have. Reports show that Marteen had previously claimed to support the Taliban, Al Nusra, and Hezbollah in addition to ISIS. The fact that these groups are all currently at war with each other suggests that Mateen was not actually working with any international terrorist organizations but was influenced by their propaganda.Featured image from screenshot via Twitter",

        "text": "Just days after the death of his own son in combat, Lt Gen John Kelly eulogized two other sons in an unforgettable manner:Two years ago when I was the Commander of all U.S. and Iraqi forces, in fact, the 22nd of April 2008, two Marine infantry battalions, 1/9  The Walking Dead,  and 2/8 were switching out in Ramadi. One battalion in the closing days of their deployment going home very soon, the other just starting its seven-month combat tour.Two Marines, Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance Corporal Jordan Haerter, 22 and 20 years old respectively, one from each battalion, were assuming the watch together at the entrance gate of an outpost that contained a makeshift barracks housing 50 Marines.The same broken down ramshackle building was also home to 100 Iraqi police, also my men and our allies in the fight against the terrorists in Ramadi, a city until recently the most dangerous city on earth and owned by Al Qaeda. Yale was a dirt poor mixed-race kid from Virginia with a wife and daughter, and a mother and sister who lived with him and he supported as well. He did this on a yearly salary of less than $23,000. Haerter, on the other hand, was a middle class white kid from Long Island.They were from two completely different worlds. Had they not joined the Marines they would never have met each other, or understood that multiple America s exist simultaneously depending on one s race, education level, economic status, and where you might have been born. But they were Marines, combat Marines, forged in the same crucible of Marine training, and because of this bond they were brothers as close, or closer, than if they were born of the same woman.The mission orders they received from the sergeant squad leader I am sure went something like:  Okay you two clowns, stand this post and let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass.   You clear?  I am also sure Yale and Haerter then rolled their eyes and said in unison something like:  Yes Sergeant,  with just enough attitude that made the point without saying the words,  No kidding sweetheart, we know what we re doing.  They then relieved two other Marines on watch and took up their post at the entry control point of Joint Security Station Nasser, in the Sophia section of Ramadi, al Anbar, Iraq.A few minutes later a large blue truck turned down the alley way perhaps 60-70 yards in length and sped its way through the serpentine of concrete jersey walls. The truck stopped just short of where the two were posted and detonated, killing them both catastrophically. Twenty-four brick masonry houses were damaged or destroyed. A mosque 100 yards away collapsed. The truck s engine came to rest two hundred yards away knocking most of a house down before it stopped.Our explosive experts reckoned the blast was made of 2,000 pounds of explosives. Two died, and because these two young infantrymen didn t have it in their DNA to run from danger, they saved 150 of their Iraqi and American brothers-in-arms.When I read the situation report about the incident a few hours after it happened I called the regimental commander for details as something about this struck me as different. Marines dying or being seriously wounded is commonplace in combat. We expect Marines regardless of rank or MOS to stand their ground and do their duty, and even die in the process, if that is what the mission takes. But this just seemed different.The regimental commander had just returned from the site and he agreed, but reported that there were no American witnesses to the event just Iraqi police. I figured if there was any chance of finding out what actually happened and then to decorate the two Marines to acknowledge their bravery, I d have to do it as a combat award that requires two eye-witnesses and we figured the bureaucrats back in Washington would never buy Iraqi statements. If it had any chance at all, it had to come under the signature of a general officer.I traveled to Ramadi the next day and spoke individually to a half-dozen Iraqi police all of whom told the same story. The blue truck turned down into the alley and immediately sped up as it made its way through the serpentine. They all said,  We knew immediately what was going on as soon as the two Marines began firing.  The Iraqi police then related that some of them also fired, and then to a man, ran for safety just prior to the explosion.All survived. Many were injured   some seriously. One of the Iraqis elaborated and with tears welling up said,  They d run like any normal man would to save his life. What he didn t know until then, he said, and what he learned that very instant, was that Marines are not normal. Choking past the emotion he said,  Sir, in the name of God no sane man would have stood there and done what they did. No sane man. They saved us all. What we didn t know at the time, and only learned a couple of days later after I wrote a summary and submitted both Yale and Haerter for posthumous Navy Crosses, was that one of our security cameras, damaged initially in the blast, recorded some of the suicide attack. It happened exactly as the Iraqis had described it. It took exactly six seconds from when the truck entered the alley until it detonated.You can watch the last six seconds of their young lives. Putting myself in their heads I supposed it took about a second for the two Marines to separately come to the same conclusion about what was going on once the truck came into their view at the far end of the alley. Exactly no time to talk it over, or call the sergeant to ask what they should do. Only enough time to take half an instant and think about what the sergeant told them to do only a few minutes before:     let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass. The two Marines had about five seconds left to live. It took maybe another two seconds for them to present their weapons, take aim, and open up. By this time the truck was half-way through the barriers and gaining speed the whole time. Here, the recording shows a number of Iraqi police, some of whom had fired their AKs, now scattering like the normal and rational men they were some running right past the Marines. They had three seconds left to live.For about two seconds more, the recording shows the Marines  weapons firing non-stop the truck s windshield exploding into shards of glass as their rounds take it apart and tore in to the body of the son-of-a-bitch who is trying to get past them to kill their brothers American and Iraqi bedded down in the barracks totally unaware of the fact that their lives at that moment depended entirely on two Marines standing their ground. If they had been aware, they would have know they were safe   because two Marines stood between them and a crazed suicide bomber.The recording shows the truck careening to a stop immediately in front of the two Marines. In all of the instantaneous violence Yale and Haerter never hesitated. By all reports and by the recording, they never stepped back. They never even started to step aside. They never even shifted their weight. With their feet spread shoulder width apart, they leaned into the danger, firing as fast as they could work their weapons. They had only one second left to live.The truck explodes. The camera goes blank. Two young men go to their God.Six seconds.Not enough time to think about their families, their country, their flag, or about their lives or their deaths, but more than enough time for two very brave young men to do their duty   into eternity. That is the kind of people who are on watch all over the world tonight for you. ",

        "text": "The White House s official website used to have lengthy pages on several topics, including climate change, the ACA, LGBTQ rights and civil rights, among other things. The instant the clock struck noon in Washington, though, Trump and his admin furiously began scrubbing the site of pretty much everything they don t like.Obama once had a very long and detailed page dedicated exclusively to fighting climate change, which is an issue that s growing in importance. 2015 was once the hottest year on record. Now 2016 is the hottest year on record. In other words, the planet is heating faster and faster, according to real science, but Trump and his administration still seem to think climate change is either a hoax, or it s a nuisance to be destroyed.Otherwise Trump wouldn t have appointed Scott Pruitt, a lying climate denier as head of the EPA, which he also happens to be suing (or was).Scientists have been scrambling to preserve as much government climate data as possible in recent weeks, downloading everything to a network of servers in Canada where Herr Trump can t touch it. And now their fears that Trump wants to squash talk of man-made climate change are starting to play out.Trump s only mention of anything having to do with the environment is his  America First Energy Plan.  That plan is committed to rolling back EPA rules and expanding fossil fuel operations because that s obviously the magic bullet we need for jobs, energy growth and the environment (the truth was spoken by a coal miner who, on Dec. 22, blasted any ideas that we can actually bring coal jobs back to coal country to smithereens).Where once there was a fount of information, a search for  climate change,   global warming,  and anything along those lines on the White House s site suddenly reveals a whole lot of nothing.  It s completely normal for whitehouse.gov to change rapidly with an incoming administration, but it doesn t appear to be customary to scrub all references to absolutely everything the incoming administration has been sneering at the whole time.Motherboard s Jason Koebler made this all the more ominous by saying: Scientists I ve spoken to who are archiving websites say they expect scientific data on the NASA, NOAA, Department of Energy, and EPA websites to be neglected or deleted eventually. They say they don t expect agency sites to be updated immediately, but expect it to play out over the course of months. This sort of low-key data destruction might not be the type of censorship people typically think about, but scientists are treating it as such. Do we really have to wonder whether Trump will try and censor all climate change information everywhere? No, we really do not.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",

        "text": "Emboldened by a radical leftist  President  who thumbs his nose at our Constitution and the core values our nation was founded on, our teachers and professors in colleges and universities across America are ramping it up. Our children and our nation will pay a heavy price unless we step and in and demand accountability for their actions A professor at Polk State College has allegedly failed a humanities student after she refused to concede that Jesus is a  myth  or that Christianity oppresses women during a series of mandatory assignments at the Florida college.According to a press release from the Liberty Counsel, a non-profit public interest law firm, Humanities Professor Lance  Lj  Russum gave a student a  zero  on four separate papers because the 16-year-old did not  conform to his personal worldviews of Marxism, Atheism, Feminism, and homosexuality.  The law firm has called for a full, private investigation of the professor and the course curriculum.The course description for the class,   Introduction to Humanities,  claims that students  are under no obligation to agree with classmates, authors, or the instructor, in fact, the instructor will often occupy the space of  Devil s Advocate  for the purpose of lively discussion. The point of this is not to  bash  any religion, we should NEVER favor one over another, they all come from the same source, HUMAN IMAGINATION and [sic] they demonstrate that humanity is one,  a copy of Russum s class outline, riddled with grammatical errors, says.Video via Breitbart News We have much to thank of [sic] humans like Michelangelo who took a sacred space, a temple to god, and made it a HUMAN space, a space where humanism can meet with god and discourse,  one course assignment read.  Finally humanity and the gods are on equal footing and that is what the myths of Hercules, Apollo and Jesus are all about the divine becoming human and human being divine. In her essay, the student, who Liberty Counsel identifies as  G.L.,  argued that  it is a logical fallacy to make the assumption that Christian humanism s goal was to  blend mythologies and make man the center  simply on account of Michelangelo s artwork or because Renaissance artists incorporate classicism. The student apparently received a zero on that assignment.Another assignment allegedly required students to discuss how  fortunate  Martin Luther was to be born in a historical moment that allowed him to  challenge the mythos of the power structure of the church.  The assignment required students to write only about the humanism of Luther and his reformation and students were instructed in bolded text to keep theology out of the paper: WHAT YOU MUST NOT WRITE ABOUT: 1. This is NOT about Luther s theology 2. Any quotes from his sermons or writings MUST be about humanism and how the reformation is in the right place and right time in history NOT some divine providence of the gods 3. You must stay focused on the history of the humanism of Luther and his reformation IF You turn this into a theological debate or divine providence I will NOT read it and you will be given a zero. She failed that assignment as well.Another description on the course outline criticized Christianity as one of the  most violent forms of religion the world has ever seen,  and bashed the religion for its  dominance by powerful men.  The description, supposedly for a class centered on the role of religion in the Middle Ages, claims that today s major religions  STILL attempt to regulate the bodies of women. One assignment supposedly required students to argue why  did Christianity, and its male gods, want to silence  a specific group of nuns. SECOND, and this is VERY important, I DO NOT want you to write about how wonderful you think Christianity is now because women can do A, B, or C. History is history and facts are facts and your opinion on if it is better now or not is irrelevant for this discussion,  the assignment, obtained by the Liberty Counsel, read.  This is a HISTORICAL discussion about the middle ages. If you really feel the need to express your opinion on how you think Christianity is now for women you may email me, you may call my office or I would love for you to stop by for a nice cup of hot tea where we can talk about it but it does not belong in this assignment. The pieces your are [sic] reading a [sic] from some of the greatest expressions of mythology by women ever, the question is to honor that voice in that moment of history. Christianity. According to the Liberty Counsel, Russum s Facebook page which appears to have been deleted or unlisted via the website s privacy settings included photos of Jesus making an obscene gesture, and his email signature supposedly includes a quote from a Marxist. These, along with the inapropriate course content, show that Professor Russum is seeking to impose his own values on students, in violation of the Constitution,  the press release states.In an email to G.L. s parents, obtained by Liberty Counsel, Dean of Academic Affairs Donald Painter said that he had reviewed the materials presented in Russum s Humanities 2020 course and  believe[d] them to be appropriate.  Painter apologized that the student and her family found the course materials to be  distasteful,  but said the materials would not be modified.Painter, who did not respond to an emailed request for comment from Campus Reform, reminded the student s parents in the email that they had signed an agreement with her dual-enrollment that acknowledged they were aware that some course material may be developed for  the adult student, age 18 or older. According to its website, the college s core values are service, integrity, knowledge, diversity, and leadership. No student should be subjected to such outrageous bias and outright hostility to their values by a professor. Being a professor is not open season to belittle and punish students merely because they do not subscribe to the professor s radical opinions,  Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, said in the press release.The Liberty Counsel is asking for not only a full and independent investigation of Russum and the humanities course materials, but also a written apology, re-grading of the student s assignments, and assurance that Russum s future courses will be free from discrimination. In this age of grade inflation it is difficult to earn a grade of zero much less four consecutive zeros. Professors who do so are likely to be sending a message,  Dr. Mike Adams, a professor at the University of North Carolina Wilmington and no stranger to religious bias in academia, told Campus Reform.  A cursory examination of this professor s test questions leaves little doubt about what that message is. The school would be foolish to ignore reasonable requests for an independent investigation. Otherwise they may be on the receiving end of another kind of message in the form of a civil complaint. According to the website Rate My Professor, Russum has an overall quality rating of 4.3 and the average grade of an  A.  His page is also adorned with a chili pepper to indicate his physical attractiveness. One student labeled him a Marxist and feminist in 2011.Russum did not respond to an emailed request for comment from Campus Reform.Polk State College officials said the school s legal counsel is reviewing the issue but declined to comment further to Campus Reform.Richard Mast, a lawyer with the Liberty Counsel who is assigned to the case, told Campus Reform that the school has yet to respond to the Liberty Counsel s letter but have until Friday to do so. The Liberty Counsel is prepared to  take further action,  if needed, Mast said. In terms of egregious behavior by professors, this is certainly one of those cases that will forge new ground on what not to do,  Mast told Campus Reform in an interview. This is the most wildly inappropriate behavior I ve seen that reflects a growing hostility towards religion Christianity in particular,  Mast said.According to Mast, the Liberty Counsel does have more documents in a file on Russum s classroom behavior that the firm has not yet released.The public state school, located in Lakeland, Fla., has more than 10,000 students enrolled.",

Let me give you an example of India, so we can look at this at the level of theory. India was invaded by the British, and earlier by the Afghans, and the Persians and the Mongols. So you have all these successive invasions. Right? Are you actually saying that you believe in a rule of social justice today, that says globally lets look at this as a global rule of justice I m gonna figure out whose ancestors did what to whom and I m going to return goods that were illicitly taken from the beginning, to the people who had it originally. Do you believe that s a viable way to organize our society? Do you believe, if I can ask you a direct question, that you are the benefit of  white privilege  here at Amherst? The rest is pure gold Since you are an acknowledged beneficiary of illicit  white privilege.  Would you be willing to step aside, voluntarily, putting your own moral mouth where your  self-proclaimed virtue  is, and give your seat, your seat, not my seat, I realize you may be super generous with other people s advantages and favor affirmative action so other white kids who apply to Amherst are turned away  to open spaces for minorities.

        "title": "Buchanan on Trump: After the Coup, What Then?",
        "text": " By Patrick J. BuchananThat the Trump presidency is bedeviled is undeniable.As President Donald Trump flew off for August at his Jersey club, there came word that Special Counsel Robert Mueller III had impaneled a grand jury and subpoenas were going out to Trump family and campaign associates.The jurors will be drawn from a pool of citizens in a city Hillary Clinton swept with 91 percent of the vote. Trump got 4 percent.Whatever indictments Mueller wants, Mueller gets.Thanks to a media that savages him ceaselessly, Trump is down to 33 percent approval in a Quinnipiac University poll and below 40 percent in most of the rest.Before Trump departed D.C., The Washington Post ran transcripts of his phone conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.Even Obama administration veterans were stunned.So, it is time to ask: If this city brings Trump down, will the rest of America rejoice?What will be the reaction out there in fly-over country, that land where the  deplorables  dwell who produce the soldiers to fight our wars? Will they toast the  free press  that brought down the president they elected, and in whom they had placed so much hope?My guess: The reaction will be one of bitterness, cynicism, despair, a sense that the fix is in, that no matter what we do, they will not let us win. If Trump is brought down, American democracy will take a pasting. It will be seen as a fraud. And the backlash will poison our politics to where only an attack from abroad, like 9/11, will reunite us.Our media preen and posture as the defenders of democracy, devoted to truth, who provide us round-the-clock protection from tyranny. But half the nation already sees the media as a propaganda arm of a liberal establishment that the people have rejected time and again.Consider the Post s publication of the transcripts of Trump s calls with Mexico s president and Australia s prime minister.When reporter Greg Miller got these transcripts, his editors, knowing they would damage Trump, plastered them on Page 1.The Post was letting itself be used by a leaker engaged in disloyal and possibly criminal misconduct. Yet the Post agreed to provide confidentiality and to hide the Trump-hater s identity.This is what we do, says the Post. People have a right to know if President Trump says one thing at rallies about Mexico paying for the wall and another to the president of Mexico. This is a story.But there is a far larger story here, of which this Post piece is but an exhibit. It is the story of a concerted campaign, in which the anti-Trump media publish leaks, even criminal leaks, out of the FBI, CIA, NSA and NSC, to bring down a president whom the Beltway media and their deep-state collaborators both despise and wish to destroy.Did Trump collude with Putin to defeat Clinton, the Beltway media demand to know, even as they daily collude with deep-state criminals to bring down the president of the United States.And if there is an unfolding silent coup by the regime Americans repudiated in 2016   to use security leaks and the lethal weapon of a special counsel to overturn the election results   is that not a story worth covering as much as what Trump said to Pena Nieto?Do the people not have a right know who are the snakes collaborating with the Never-Trump press to bring down their head of state? Is not discovering the identities of deep-state felons a story that investigative reporters should be all over?If Greg Miller is obligated to protect his source, fine. But why are other journalists not exposing his identity?The answer suggests itself. This is a collaborative enterprise, where everyone protects everyone else s sources, because all have the same goal: the dumping of Trump. If that requires collusion with criminals, so be it.The Justice Department is now running down the leaks, and the ACLU s Ben Wizner is apoplectic:  Every American should be concerned about the Trump administration s threat to step up its efforts against whistleblowers and journalists. A crackdown on leaks is a crackdown on the free press and on democracy. That s one way to put it. Another is that some of these  whistleblowers  are political criminals who reject the verdict of the American electorate in 2016 and are out to overturn it. And the aforementioned  journalists  are their enablers and collaborators.And if, as Wizner s asserts, protecting secrets is tantamount to a  crackdown on the free press and democracy,  no wonder the free press and democracy are falling into disrepute all over the world.By colluding, the mainstream media, deep state, and the special prosecutor s button men, with a license to roam, may bring down yet another president. So doing, they will validate John Adams s insight: Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.

        "text": "What a brave boy and what a sad world we live in where adults would allow such a beautiful child to be repeatedly tortured by classmates, without stepping in and preventing it from happening. At the very least, our children should know that they are safe in the classroom, on the playground, and in the cafeteria, where they attend school.  Students who are being bullied in school should know that they will be protected by teachers and staff who should be paying attention to the children who need them most.  Where was the lunch staff when this young boy was being humiliated and bullied by classmates? Fat. Gay. Or just different from the crowd. These are the reasons children are being bullied   sometimes to death   in America s schools, with at least 14 students committing suicide in the past year alone. ABCKnox News  The anti-bullying video of a Union County middle schooler went viral over the weekend, garnering the attention of the Tennessee Titans and the University of Tennessee Vols football teams.Kimberly Jones posted the video of her son, Keaton, on her Facebook page Friday shortly after 12:30 p.m. She said she had just picked Keaton up from school because he was too afraid to go to lunch as a result of bullying. For the record, Keaton asked to do this AFTER he had me pick him up AGAIN because he was afraid to go to lunch,  Jones wrote in her Facebook post. My kids are by no stretch perfect, and at home, he s as all boy as they come, but by all accounts, he s good at school. Talk to your kids. I ve even had friends of mine tell me (their) kids were only nice to him to get him to mess with people. We all know how it feels to want to belong, but only a select few know how it really feels not to belong anywhere,  she wrote.In the video, Keaton, crying in the passenger seat, describes having milk poured on him and ham put down his clothes. Just out of curiosity, why do they bully? What s the point of it?  Keaton began.  Why do you find joy in taking innocent people and finding a way to be mean to  em? It s not okay. Keaton said kids at school make fun of his nose, call him ugly and tell him he has no friends.Watch:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.11';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));This is a friend of mine Kimberly Jones son KRJ.

At a birthday party, she wrote, another boy said he knew Keaton by his scars, one that  goes all the way across his face. Jones wrote that her son was born with a tumor. It s not OK!  Keaton cried in his video.  People that are different don t need to be criticized about it. It s not their fault. But if you are made fun of, don t let it bother you. They suck I guess. Hard. But it will probably get better one day. Within hours, the post had thousands of views. By Saturday night it had been viewed more than 11 million times and shared by nearly 250,000 people.Sean Hannity saw the viral video on Twitter and asked for the name of the principal and the school where the repetitive bullying of Keaton Jones was taking place, so he could personally call and  fix this . Hannity also asked for anyone who knew the parents to help him contact them, so he could have them on his show, so they could share their story with others. If someone can get to me the name of the school, the principal, school board members i will gladly make the calls myself and fix this. Also if anyone knows Keaton and his parents, i will gladly fly them to NYC to be my guest & visit Fox News. https://t.co/uFyp2r2Yn7  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) December 10, 2017 ",

        "title": "BREAKING EXCLUSIVE: BLACK REPUBLICAN Fired From Radio Station After Spending Time With Trump In Detroit",
        "text": "For just a little over four months, Wayne Bradley could be heard spreading the conservative message on Detroit s 910AM Superstation. Then GOP nominee Donald Trump came to town, and things changed drastically.We ve known soft-spoken conservative, Wayne Bradley for several years. He s never been afraid of controversy and has always stood up for his conservative beliefs.On Friday, Bradley told us in an exclusive interview that local media had reached out to him when Trump came due to his position as State Director of African American Engagement for the Republican National Committee. Bradley   who was unpaid during his time at the station   didn t mention his affiliation with 910AM, which, he said, he generally doesn t do when discussing political issues with the media.He also met Trump and posted a photo of him with the candidate. When asked, Bradley said he had nothing to do with Trump s visit and was at at the rally with a pastor.The station, which was well aware of his work with the GOP, informed him by email that he was on  hiatus  that Friday, leading him to believe he would be back on the air shortly. But that wasn t the case.He received clarification on Monday that the show was canceled   for good.It s not clear why station management decided to cancel the show.A station representative told 100 Percent FED UP,  It was a business decision on the back-end. We contacted 910AM and spoke to an administrative assistant who refused to provide her name. According to the person we spoke to, no one at the station was available for comment because they were,  very, very  busy with meetings about Bradley s dismissal.The unnamed assistant told us that a statement would be released, but she was unsure when that might happen.But that s not what station owner Kevin Adell told the Detroit News. According to that report, Bradley was allegedly fired  for violating corporate policy. He violated corporate policy, that s why he got fired. He was let go for insubordination.  But it s not clear what policy Bradley allegedly violated. Bradley suggested it may have been due to the fact he didn t plug the station during interviews with the press.Regardless of the reason, Bradley said he appreciated the opportunity to have a dialogue with the community and was very grateful to have the air time.Moreover, he said that he understands the left-wing political climate in Detroit and respects the owner s decision.While he respects the decision, he told us he was  disappointed  with management for  silencing the dialogue. Others weren t happy with the decision and made their feelings known on the station s Facebook page. 910AM where blacks are kept on the Gov ment PLANTATION and other views of them PROSPERING on their own merits is not allowed,  one person said. Your way or the hiway-not the station I want to listen to-I m out!!!  another person added. I would like to know where Wayne Bradley is at? Why is he not on the air? Shameless,  commented a third critic.Bradley, who has been in radio off and on for about six years, says he s not worried and knows that something better will come along.And, he added, he appreciates the support of the listeners who reached out to the station.Meanwhile, the Oakland County Republican Party has offered their support for Wayne Bradley and asked fellow Republicans to call Superstation 910AM at:Station Phone: (248) 278-0910 Fax: (248) 350-3422 Studio Phone: (313) 209-9000Attention: Kevin Adell, Owner of 910 AM Dody Johnson, Station ManagerIn the meantime, Bradley said he ll continue his daily outreach efforts   something he s been doing since September 2013. It s a different battle in Detroit,  he told us. The key, he added, is to  stay positive. As for the incident with 910AM, Bradley said he views it as a  minor speed bump. ",

        "text": "A 10-year-old girl s awful experience with a TSA agent is now making national headlines after she was forced to undergo an inappropriately long and invasive pat down.Vendela Payne had been traveling back home to California with her family when she was stopped by a TSA agent at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina. Vendela had accidentally left a Capri Sun drink in her bag as she went through the security line and was flagged for further screening   which is when her travel experience changed drastically.Removed from her family, Vendela was forced to endure an uncomfortable pat down that lasted two uncomfortably long minutes. Her father, Kevin Payne, was on the other side of the glass and began recording the entire screening as he noticed  it was an uncomfortable situation. In the video footage below, you can see how lengthy, repetitive and invasive the pat down was, as Kevin repeatedly calls out the TSA s actions in the overlaying text:If you didn t observe how uncomfortable the pat-down made Vendela feel by her frozen, blank stare in the video, she spoke about the traumatizing experience in an interview with NBC. The young girl said she kept trying not to  throw a tantrum like a 1-year-old. : My dad was making funny faces silly faces in the mirror and I felt like screaming the whole time. I know it s to keep everybody on the plane safe, but she kept patting me down. Pat down, pat down. It was like, over and over. TSA agent pats down Vendela s chestWhile Kevin says that he supports airport security policies and safety procedures, he agrees with his daughter that the TSA agent was inappropriate during the pat down. He said: I m a very big proponent of security, and if they were patting me down no problem, but this was a 10-year-old girl. The whole system seems to not work the way it should be working. They gave her a very standard pat-down for an adult female. I don t think it was modified one bit. If you look at videos, most pat-downs on adults (take) about a minute. Start to finish, in real time, (Vendala s pat-down) was 1 minute and 47 seconds. It just didn t seem like it was an efficient pat-down. The TSA s website states that screenings are meant to determine if prohibited items are being hidden under clothing and that agents will use sufficient pressure to detect concealed items. However, the site also says that screening procedures for kids 12 and under have been modified so that children are not likely to undergo a pat down screening. In Vendela s case, her father believes that the agent chose the pat down screening without considering other options.",

        "text": "This week, black men died at the hands of police in two unjustified and high profile scenarios. The murders of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and of Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, have once again reminded us that there is an unequal system of justice in America. If you re white, you re arrested and charged. If you re not, something as simple as jaywalking can be a death sentence.Video of the Sterling shooting shows officer pinning the 37-year-old man to the ground before he was shot multiple times in the back and chest. As for Castile, well, we saw him die live on Facebook after his girlfriend turned on her camera following the shooting. They had been pulled over for a  busted tail light,  and the 32-year-old was shot as he was reaching for his ID and wallet as police requested. Castile had a gun on him   he licensed to carry a concealed weapon   but this incident serves as more evidence that the Second Amendment is a  whites-only  thing.Both of these men, like Michael Brown and Eric Garner, John Crawford and the numerous black men gunned down by racist police, clearly did not deserve to die. It s not like they drew a weapon and fired at police. Who would do that, anyway? Oh, right.Ray, 62, was arrested peacefully by police after he innocently stood on the roadside in Wake County, North Carolina, as he pointed his shotgun at passing cars. You know, exercising his Second Amendment rights and all that. When Sheriff s Deputy D.R. Farmerstopped to question him, Ray became belligerent and pointed the shotgun at the officer. This alone would give Farmer reason to, at minimum, draw his weapon. But it gets worse. The deputy luckily grabbed the barrel and pushed him back,  Sheriff Donnie Harrison said.  The man says,  I got something for you  and reached in his pocket and came back with a pistol. Farer pushed the .22-caliber handgun aside, but not before Ray was able to fire off a shot. Luckily, nobody got hurt. That s the good thing. God was looking out for us,  Harrison said.  (Ray) was very fortunate that he didn t get shot, very fortunate that anybody didn t get shot. Why didn t he get shot? What could possibly be the difference between this man and those who were so recently outright murdered by police?Ray s defense attorney and neighbor says mental health is the issue, but police point out that alcohol was a factor as well. Ray was drunk at the time of the incident. After his arrest, Ray continued to be uncooperative with police, snatching cameras off the wall of an interrogation room.He has been charged with two counts of assault on a law enforcement officer with a firearm and one count of injury to personal property because of the camera incident.At no point was he beaten, shot, deprived of food and water, or denied medical care. It s almost as though he s considered a human being with rights   which is treatment above and beyond what many African-Americans receive from police across the nation. Even if they are lucky enough to live long enough to see the inside of a jail cell, as we noticed with Sandra Bland, death is always lurking around the corner   and it s usually wearing a badge.Watch a report on the arrest below:Featured image via screengrab",

        "text": "Ann Coulter is one of those blatantly offensive conservatives that most of us wish would just go away, but she continues to find a way to make herself seem somewhat relevant by spewing inflammatory remarks and hate speech on news shows.On Friday, Bill Maher had Coulter on Real Time, where she probably thought she was going to succeed in spreading her ignorant views and praise for Donald Trump. But Maher s show took another turn   instead, Coulter was mercilessly bashed by one of Maher s other guests, sex columnist Dan Savage.Savage, being more than familiar with Coulter s anti-immigration stance (which basically makes Trump her political soulmate), called Coulter out and brutally exposed the stupidity behind her beliefs. He asked: Why do we want to throw these 11 million people out of the country? They contribute more to our economy than they take out; they pay more in taxes than they receive in services; illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes per capita  Coulter cut Savage off, interrupting him with made up  facts  even though she claimed that his points were  untrue  and  false facts.  She added: Not only are they false facts, but if they are true facts then you need to go and elect people who will change the laws. Savage didn t let up. Referring to Trump s obsession with building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, Savage fired back and took Coulter s smug smile right off her face when he said, But your rationale for building this wall is bullsh*t. Coulter argued, No, the rationale is that he [would be] the commander-in-chief, he protects the borders. Those are the laws. Savage also made sure to rip the GOP as a whole just as hard as he railed against Coulter. Earlier in the conversation, Coulter made a comment that Savage  should be the spokesman for Hillary Clinton  because he was so judgmental and critical of the Republican Party. She   once again passing off lies as facts, said, That s gonna be a big hit with the American people   who are overwhelmingly voting for Trump. Savage didn t sugarcoat the truth for Coulter. He countered: No, the GOP base   which is overwhelmingly rubes, idiots, sexists, racists   are overwhelmingly voting for Trump.

        "text": "Donald Trump has placed gag orders on multiple federal agencies, telling them to not only cut off communication with the public and the press but also with members of Congress. Go figure, that didn t sit very well with some people, especially since that happens to be illegal. And two House Democrats have decided to take action.Rep. Elijah Cummings and Rep. Frank Pallone sent a letter to the White House Counsel asking that they  take immediate action to remedy the Trump Administration s apparent violations of multiple federal laws by imposing gag orders on federal employees that prevent them from communicating with Congress. The letter explained that the  gag orders appear to violate the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act  as well as the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016  because they do not include a mandatory statement  explaining that employees are still allowed to talk to members of Congress and Inspectors General.The letter points out that the Consolidated Appropriations Act also states that if a federal employee tries to stop another federal employee from speaking to Congress about anything job related, they forfeit their salary.Cummings and Pallone cite  a memo issued by the Acting Secretary of the Department of Health and human Services on President Trump s first day in office,  which states: No correspondence to public officials (e.g. Members of Congress, Governors) or containing interpretations or statements of Department regulations or policy, unless specifically authorized by me or my designee, shall be sent between now and February 3. The congressmen write that this memo and similar restrictions placed on federal agencies such as the Departments of Interior, Transportation, and Agriculture,  appears to violate all of these laws. Cummings and Pallone then urged the Trump administration to  immediately rescind all  of the illegal gag orders. They added that  because of the magnitude of these problematic directives, we request that the President issue an official statement making clear to all federal employees that they have the right to communicate with Congress and that he and his Administration will not silence or retaliate against whistleblowers.

Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,  Trump said.  I told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that. It s not a guarantee, but it s definitely a reversal from he has been telling his supporters throughout his campaign for the last year and a half.Republicans have been trying to destroy the healthcare law for years and even shut the government down in protest of the law. They were hoping Donald Trump would be a rubber stamp to their agenda and now it turns out President Obama may have reasoned with Trump. And considering over 100,000 Americans have signed up for an Obamacare health plan already this year and repealing the law could seriously hurt millions of Americans, including conservatives, it looks like Trump has changed his tune on a core campaign promise.And of course, his supporters are already starting to throw a hissy fit about it.@thehill KEEP YOUR PROMISE AND REPEAL IT DON T SELL US OUT BEFORE YOU ARE SOWRN IN KEEP YOUR WORD &DON T LET US DOWN  ERNIE (@GRANDPASOF) November 11, 2016@thehill watch it!

Yesterday a 56-year-old reporter representing Playboy magazine had an epic meltdown in the White House press briefing room after White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders put him in his place following the release of an undercover bombshell video by Project Veritas that exposed CNN as a network that fabricates news for ratings.Brian Karem complained about journalists being called out as  fake news  when they report falsehoods, and protested on behalf of the honor of all White House journalists.  Conservative TreehouseIn an effort to capitalize on his moment in the sun, today 56-year-old Brian Karem runs to the Associated Press and claims Sarah Sanders and Sean Spicer (White House Press Secretaries) are  bullying him  and not giving him enough respect:AP   The reporter who accused White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders of inflaming the public against the media at a press briefing says he did it because he s tired of being bullied by the administration. There s a time and a place for everything and the time has come to stand up and be counted,  Karem told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  I m tired of taking it. I want friendly relationships, but those who want respect, show respect. We have shown that man and shown the administration respect for six months, and all we re getting in return is a lack of respect, derision and bullying. Karem, 56, is not a representative of the large national media organizations repeatedly described as  fake news  by the president. Besides his editing, he writes for Playboy, where his first-person account of the confrontation was posted late Tuesday. Note to Brian Karem: when a woman like Sarah Huckabee Sanders stands her ground and defends a man she respects and admires that s been unjustly accused of wrongdoing, is not called  bullying she s simply not allowing herself to be steamrolled by the bullies in the media BOOOM Sarah Huckabee Sanders advises ALL to watch Veritas Video where CNN producer admits they realize Trump/Russia is a hoax but dont care! pic.twitter.com/tng5DUmKq3   STOCK MONSTER  (@StockMonsterUSA) June 27, 2017",

        "text": "Much to the Republican party s dismay, bigotry and intolerance doesn t sit well with even the most God-fearing American voters anymore. According to data from a new Pew poll on religion and this year s election, the GOP is actually striking out with Catholic voters   a demographic that the party used to have in the bag. And it gets worse   not only are Catholic voters leaving the GOP in droves, but they re opting to support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton instead.Pew reported that Clinton is leading Trump among Catholic voters, and Trump is partially to blame   much of the demographic that is supporting her are Latino Catholics, which Trump has insulted and offended throughout his campaign:Currently, Clinton also holds a 17-point advantage among Catholic registered voters, driven largely by overwhelming support for Clinton among Latino Catholics. By contrast, at a similar point in the 2012 campaign, Catholics were closely divided between support for Obama (49%) and Romney (47%). Exit polls conducted on Election Day in 2012 found that Catholics ultimately split their votes between Obama (50%) and Romney (48%).Here s a chart that outlines how different religious groups are currently voting, compared to the 2012 election between President Barack Obama and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney:Thanks to his divisive campaign and moronic behavior, Trump is striking out with every demographic that should be his strong point as a GOP candidate. He s succeeded in dividing the Republican party and turning conservative voters away from the GOP, and now he s turning off religious voters that are usually very receptive to conservative values and talking points.It s entirely possible that when election day comes, Trump won t even be considered a threat to the former Secretary of State. If he cannot rise to the performance level of Romney in 2012 in winning over America s religious voters, he doesn t even have the slightest chance. Currently, Clinton is ahead of Trump by 17 Catholic voters and 42 unaffiliated voters. If she keeps it up, the GOP is in big trouble when November arrives.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",

        "text": "When will government officials who allowed this nightmare to grow like a cancer in Sweden be held accountable? Breitbart  Two asylum seekers who are on trial for raping a Swedish girl and streaming the ordeal live on Facebook will not face deportation back to their home countries.The asylum seekers directly involved in the rape, aged 18 and 21, will not face deportation after the prosecution withdrew their previous claim.From 24 Uppsala: On Tuesday, ending the trial of the three men suspected of involvement in the rape that has been broadcast live in a closed group on Facebook.A 25-year old man is on suspicion of failure to disclose rape, and two men, a 21-year-old and a 18 year old, on probable cause suspected of rape.The three accused men sat sunken in their chairs, and the hearing began with a number of charges against two men, one admitted all seven points including the possession and consumption of drugs and driving without a license and DUI.The most remarkable thing was that the prosecutor Magnus Berggren denied his and prosecutors Pontus Melanders earlier demands for the expulsion of two of the men (18 year old and 21 year old) who were not born in Sweden. Only yesterday, he told me that nothing has changed regarding the claim.Mr. Wallin, who represents the 21-year-old Afghan national, said he and his 18-year-old co-defendant arrived in Sweden when they were under the age of 15. The third defendant in the case, a 25-year-old Iranian immigrant with Swedish citizenship, is also being tried as he is accused of filming the incident and not reporting it to the police. He also faces a charge of defamation as he broadcast the rape on Facebook. However, due to him holding Swedish citizenship, he cannot be deported. Prosecutor Pontus Melander said he was confident he would achieve a guilty verdict.  We have an incredibly good evidence in the form of film material, but it is always up to the district court,  he said.Melander said the likely punishment for the two involved in the attack would be three years in prison, while the 25-year-old who filmed it could receive a one-year sentence. The prosecution argued the sentence for slander should be at least one year due to the fact the video was spread widely on social media and the victim would have to live with it for the rest of her life.

        "text": "Kellyanne Conway is a complete hypocrite who has no soul and CNN host Jake Tapper proved it.Tapper grilled Conway during a recent forum at Harvard Kennedy School s Institute of Politics in which Conway claimed that because Donald Trump is the president-elect that means his petty tweets are  presidential  behavior. I will tell you that the president-elect looks at his social media accounts   combined 25 million, probably more at this point, users on Twitter and Facebook   as a very good platform which to convey his messages,  Conway told the student who asked the question.  He s a unique person who s been following his instincts and his judgement from the beginning. But Tapper, who as a CNN host has seen Trump s many hissy fits over CNN coverage, couldn t believe what he was hearing.Tapper pointed out that Trump s claim that 3 million people voted illegally was totally false and further pointed out that Trump routinely posts petty attacks against individuals who criticize him.  Is that really presidential behavior,  he asked. Well, he s the president-elect,  Conway replied.  So that s presidential behavior, yes. As the audience gasped in shock because Trump s behavior is definitely NOT presidential, Tapper brough up an interesting point. So the things that Bill Clinton did in the Oval Office that you criticized, those were presidential?  Tapper cleverly asked.  You are saying if the president does it, it s presidential? Conway acted shocked that Tapper would dare compare Trump to Bill Clinton, but we are talking about a man who said he liked to grab women  by the p*ssy  without permission.Tapper told Conway that just because a president does something it doesn t make it  presidential. I wasn t saying otherwise,  Conway claimed. And then the audience laughed at her.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump s behavior over the last year and a half is not presidential, but Conway insists that everything Trump does now is presidential simply because he s the president-elect. And that means Conway demonstrated her hypocrisy by whining when Tapper asked if Bill Clinton getting a blow-job in the Oval Office is presidential. After all, if the president does it, it must be presidential, right?Seriously, how does Kellyanne Conway live with herself?Featured Image: Screenshot",

        "text": "President Obama just smacked down an attempt by the Republican Congress to let Wall Street defraud senior citizens.As Addicting Info reported here on April 30, republicans in Congress have been trying to overturn President Obama s rule requiring financial advisors to act in the best interest of their clients.This rule was put in place by the Obama administration following a scathing report from Senator Elizabeth Warren s office. Warren s report showed that financial advisors were personally profiting from giving bad advice to people seeking retirement investment information.As Addicting Info reported here, financial advisers were being rewarded with all-expenses-paid, luxury vacations to places like South Africa, the Bahamas and Aruba, as well as golf outings, theater tickets, gift cards and cash prizes, all for steering retirees toward risky, company-owned investment options.A loophole in federal law made it legal for financial advisors to knowingly give people who turned to them for advice on retirement investments bad information.President Obama directed the Department of Labor to close the loophole, a move which outraged Wall Street firms and their Republican representatives in Congress.On April 19, republicans introduced legislation that would have overturned the newly revised rule.The legislation, H.J.Res.88, passed the House by a party-line vote of 234-183. It passed the Senate 56-41, with three democrats voting in support, Joe Donnelly of Illinois, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana.The legislation made its way to the president, who promptly vetoed it on Wednesday.In his veto message to Congress, the president wrote: The Department of Labor s final rule will ensure that American workers and retirees receive retirement advice that is in their best interest, better enabling them to protect and grow their savings. It is essential that these critical protections go into effect. Republicans do not have the necessary votes to overturn the President s veto.Image credit: Wikimedia Commons",

        "text": " So, if the climate scare-mongers can t frighten the adults, the next logical step is to heap angst on their children who then frighten (or better, pester) the adults into action. You need to read this ENTIRE story and watch the video near the end of the page. Finally, the United Nations Environmental Programme is spending our money to come out with scary children s fairy tales about global warming. Sedena, the Mother of the Sea, is featured in the UN Environmental Programme s latest children s book on global warming entitled  Tore and the Town on Thin Ice . This book tells the story of a young boy named Tore who lives in a village in the Arctic and is upset when he loses a dog sled race. The Mother of the Sea appears in Tore s dream and informs him that the thinning ice, which caused his loss in the dog sled race, was due to man-made global warming. But that is nothing compared to what it is doing to the Mother of the Sea s own dominion and to all living creatures. She sends an owl, a polar bear, and a whale to scare poor Tore into thinking that they will become extinct during his lifetime and that  our world is melting  from climate changes, mostly caused by those bad people in  rich countries  who are spewing gases in the air from their  huge cars , air conditioners and the like. In the words of the whale, children like Tore should  get good and angry . The book ends with a so-called  facts  section, blaming climate change on the  Industrial Revolution in Europe and North America  and singling out the United States in particular for its contribution to the production of  carbon dioxide added by humans.  It claims that  climate change will hit the poorer countries hardest  while at the same time saying that New York along with other coastal areas  could disappear beneath the waves. A psychotherapist, a true believer in the Climate Church, nevertheless argues that children should not be targeted by the climate activists   it is not good for the children and it is not good for the cause. I wish she could also see that her cause is a phony one, but I m glad she is against harming children in the name of it:Climate change community groups often want to work with children.  We must get into the schools,  says someone and there is a nod of agreement. It s worth thinking about the psychology behind this. Why is this idea so appealing? And why is it so damaging?The appeal is clear. It s fun working with children: they re responsive, creative and willing. And it s certainly easier than working with white-van-man, frequent fliers or the oil industry. The reasons given for working with children are usually two-fold:We need to influence them while they are young. If they understand the issue and the effect of their actions, they will grow up finding it natural to care for the environment. It s a good way of getting to their parents. Who can resist their child pleading with them to change the lightbulbs because it will save a polar bear?Both reasons are suspect. The first reason assumes that instruction   at best participatory, at worst didactic   is the route either to action or to the inculcation of positive values towards the environment. There is little evidence for this. We know that information based campaigns have a limited impact with adults, so why should we expect children to be different? As for values   these tend to be formed through experience, relationship, identification and social systems, not through information. If the school has an influence on values it will be through its culture, ethos and the relationships and experiences it offers not through the information it provides.Both reasons also raise direct ethical questions. It is easy to engage the sympathies of children with stories of damage to the natural world and images of suffering animals they will identify with. But children have very little power. Of all the sections of society who might make an impact on climate change, they have the least influence, the least agency, the least leverage. There is a real risk of raising levels of anxiety amongst children that will not only cause distress in the immediate term but will in the long term lead to those children turning against the environmental causes we hoped they might espouse.When I was 10 a speaker came to my school and told us about food shortages and starvation in the third world. I rushed home and explained to my parents that we needed to grow more food. I couldn t understand why they wouldn t accede to my idea of banding together with the neighbours and turning all our back gardens into a corn field. I was left haunted by images of dying children, guilt at my good fortune and the anxiety that feeds on powerlessness. In adolescence I became determinedly indifferent to the appeals from 3rd world charities. As an adult I have continued to find them difficult to relate to.We need to ask   what happens to the child whose parents are indifferent to their attempts to get them to act? What happens to the child who is overwhelmed by stories of disasters he or she cannot influence?But the deeper question is   why are adults so keen to focus on children? Why concentrate on the weakest, least influential members of society and ask them to act?Got kids? Watched as they ve been indoctrinated   sorry, I mean educated   about global warming over the last decade? Then you ll know what I mean. They come home from school moodily depressed about the future of our planet and, of course, what that means for their own lives. What s the point? We re all doomed! Why study? Why bother getting an education? It s futile. Sea levels are rising. Temperatures are soaring. Soon we ll all be living in a polluted hell-hole constantly battling the equivalent of the Queensland floods or the Victorian bushfires year upon year. And you want me to waste what precious time I have left studying accountancy? It s called nihilism, and it s even more terrifying to witness in your teenage children than hickeys, drunkenness, truancy, insolence, idleness, bad marks or bullying. Nihilism, or the conviction that life on Earth is totally pointless, saps the young of their energy, their ambition, and their will to strive, struggle and triumph.  Extract from an online article by Rowan Dean, 17 August 2011.A postgraduate student in Oxford gets it  This should be a wake-up call for all the purveyors of the  politics of fear . Children are, naturally, relatively powerless and likely to feel overwhelmed by the challenges facing mankind. But as adults, we should have a greater sense of our own collective power to master problems and build better societies. Not only does jumping from one panic to another, each with disastrous consequences   mobile phone radiation, BSE, SARS, crime, paedophilia, terrorism, bird flu, global warming   diminish our own sense of agency, by turning childhood dreams of utopia into nightmarish visions of the future it is teaching the citizens of the future all the wrong lessons. This is one of the best videos we have seen on  climate change.  There are 5 parts to this series. This is Part 1:An excellent, easy to understand piece about the TRUTH surrounding phony climate cooling, warming, change:The pollution resulting from the rapid uncontrolled post-war industrial expansion spawned two environmentalist movements. One group primarily composed of physical scientists and engineers set about to directly address the pollution problems by developing facilities and legislative controls that have to date virtually eliminated industrial contamination of soil, water and air.A second group primarily composed of activists with little or no physical science background did nothing but protest against industry without ever having addressed a single environmental problem for which they created a solution.While the physical scientists and engineers worked quietly with industry solving the environmental problems, the ideology driven environmentalist activists, used dramatic alarmist rhetoric to gain media control and have become a dominant political force capable of forcing their self-serving ideologies on the general public with impunity.The Earth entered a cooling phase in 1942, and by 1970 the environmentalists found a way to blame this cooling on industrial expansion. The concept was that particulate matter from fossil fuel usage was blocking energy from the sun giving this cooling effect. This concept was incorporated as a parameter in the crude climate models of the time, and the predictions from models run by James Hansen in 1971 projected fifty years of further cooling from the increased use of fossil fuels.Only four years later, and in spite of the continued increase in fossil fuel usage global cooling came to an end, proving that the models did not have a proper physical basis for relating fossil fuel usage to global cooling.By 1988, after 13 years of global warming the ideological environmentalists developed a new tact for blaming fossil fuels. The British Government had embarked on a political campaign to promote their nuclear industry and attack the powerful coal unions by creating alarmist scenarios of  runaway global warming  resulting from CO2 produced by coal and other fossil fuels. This was entirely political in nature with absolutely no scientific backing, but it did make the perfect weapon for the environmentalists to promote their anti energy (and anti humanity) ideology. All that was needed was some scientific justification.As was done in 1971, climate models which were now far more sophisticated provided the science backing. Instead of blaming fossil fuels for blocking incoming solar radiation, the models removed this parameter and replaced it with a newly contrived parameter that now related global warming to the effect of fossil fuel sourced CO2 on the outgoing thermal radiation from the Earth.This model also produced by James Hansen, projected warming for the next century because of the fossil fuel CO2 emissions that were increasing at a continued accelerated rate. As with the 1971 model, the 1988 model was proven to be false when global warming ended after 1998 even as CO2 emissions continued to rise at unprecedented rates. To make matters worse since 2002, the Earth has been cooling making all of the projections clearly in the wrong direction.By even the most basic standards of ethical science, models that first predict cooling from fossil fuel usage that are discredited just four years later when warming occurs with increased usage, and then predict warming from fossil fuel usage and are again discredited ten years later as cooling reoccurs with increased usage, would be declared absolutely invalid; but when ideology is involved science protocol is totally abandoned.Impact 2009As a result of the alarmist predictions of the 1988 climate models of Hansen, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was formed under the auspices of the United Nations. This body was given a science mandate to investigate the possibility of human effects on climate to determine if the projections of Hansen were valid.The true nature of the IPCC was not that of a science based body, but that of a political body to give scientific legitimacy to false alarmist predictions in order to meet a political self serving environmentalist agenda. Since its inception, the IPCC has used its position of authority to promote its agenda to the detriment of science and even more importantly to the detriment of the global population.From 1997 to 1998 the average global temperature increased by over half a degree C and from 1998 to 1999 the average global temperature fell by over half a degree C. This was due to an extraordinary el Ni o and has nothing to do with either the greenhouse effect or CO2 emissions (CO2 emissions increased from 24.0gt/y in 1997 to 24.2gt/y in 1998 to 24.4gt/y in 1999).An honest scientific body would have made some sort of statement to this effect, but the IPCC in their 2001 Third Assessment Report and particularly in their Summary for Policy Makers for this report not only made no mention of the fact that from 1998 to 1999 the Earth cooled more than it had ever cooled during the entire global temperature record, but emphatically stated that from 1997 to 1998 the Earth had warmed more than it ever had.This is an absolute violation of science ethics because the policy makers were purposely misinformed with alarmist rhetoric. This same 2001 report also stated that the observed global warming for the past century which they stated was attributable to CO2 emissions was measured at 0.60 C + 0.20 C. This is only 0.006 C per year making the el Ni o temperature spike over eighty times greater than what the IPCC stated was attributable to CO2 emissions, so it is clear that this was stated for the purpose of politically motivated alarmism and not to properly convey information in a scientifically justified manner.The 2001 IPCC report also included the infamous MBH98  Hockey Stick  temperature proxy which used physical temperature measurement data up to and including 1998 which gave the alarmist impression of twice the 20th century warming because 1999 was not included.The Hockey Stick graph became the pivotal evidence that convinced governments around the world to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, that has resulted in such detrimental effects to the global population and global economy.In this regard the el Ni o temperature spike of 1998 may be considered the most significant climate event in recent history, and when one considers the hundreds of millions of the world s poorest people starving because of Kyoto biofuel initiatives that has literally taken their food away and made it into  Kyoto friendly  fuel, this el Ni o might also be considered the most tragic climate event as well.Through diligence and hard work physical scientists were able to correct most of the environmental problems that had been created through industrialization, but there is no scientific effort capable of undoing the damage caused to the global population by the ideological environmentalists. This issue is now out of the hands of the scientists and the only salvation for the global population is the media who must readopt their lost journalistic integrity and expose the true nature of this global fraud.",

        "title": " Trump\u2019s Inner Circle Reveals BIZARRE New Goal In Light Of His Dwindling Odds",
        "text": "Trump seems to think he can easily garner the minimum 270 electoral votes that he would need to win the presidency, and then some. He s delusional, but he thinks it. However, Politico s Glenn Thrush says that two people in Trump s circles say that they re increasingly looking to simply beat the mere 206 votes Romney won in 2012.Trump wants to win. But two people in his orbit have told me in last week that decisively beating Romney s 206 EVs is increasingly a goal.  Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) November 5, 2016So, basically, even members of Trump s inner circles are looking at his dim odds and admitting that he probably can t win this. In fact, Politico reports that his few remaining paths to the White House are  narrow, defined and unforgiving.  He has to sweep North Carolina, Ohio, and Florida, and he has to win Utah, Arizona, and Georgia.If he wins all of those and the rest of Romney s states, he would either also have to win Pennsylvania, eke out wins in Maine, New Hampshire, Nevada and Iowa, or he would just have to pull off a shocker in states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Virginia, etc.Not much of that is bloody likely   each of these paths requires overcoming Hillary s leads, and his campaign knows that. So now, all they want is to avoid embarrassment.RealClearPolitics has Hillary leading in most polls, and even though that lead has shrunk, it s still pretty frightening for people close to Trump.And while FiveThirtyEight says that Trump is just 3.3 percent behind Hillary, polls are often off in one direction or the other by roughly two percentage points. Even if these polls end up having Hillary too far ahead, she still beats Trump by 1.3 percent, as things stand right now.In short, Trump s chances are growing ever-bleaker for everyone except the delusional Trump (who, behind the scenes, doesn t actually seem to care whether or not he wins) and his equally delusional followers. If Trump suffers the humiliating defeat that seems imminent, the whole campaign looks as stupid as they are for signing onto this circus.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",

        "title": "BREAKING: Dartmouth Tells College Republicans Auditorium \u201cnot open to presidential candidates\u201d For Trump Event\u2026But Okay For Hillary Event Tomorrow",
        "text": "In your face progressivism They re not even attempting to hide it anymore. I m starting to believe these radical colleges and universities are wearing their glaring hypocrisy like a badge of honor Despite refusing to grant permission to the College Republicans to host presidential candidate Donald Trump in the school s largest auditorium in September, on the grounds that the space was not open to presidential candidates, Dartmouth College is now permitting Hillary Clinton to speak in the location this Tuesday.Dartmouth College, an Ivy League school located in rural New Hampshire, has hosted many Republican and Democratic presidential candidates this election cycle in a variety of indoor and outdoor spaces across campus. Over Dartmouth s summer term, Hillary Clinton drew a crowd of around 850 spectators at an outdoor venue. This is a prime example of the school attempting to insert their bias onto the student population.  -Trump Campaign Tweet ThisMichelle Knesbach, a junior at Dartmouth and president of the school s College Republicans chapter, told Campus Reform that the College Republicans began to invite candidates to campus after New Hampshire s  First in the Nation  event, where members of the group had the opportunity to meet the candidates and their staff in person. We discussed opportunities for Donald Trump to come up to Dartmouth. We got to the point where it looked like we had a date set for September 30,  Knesbach stated.While previous candidates had drawn sizable crowds when they visited Dartmouth, students and Trump staffers anticipated the need for a much larger space than the other candidates had used. The only space that could fit the anticipated 800 people, Spaulding Auditorium, is located in Dartmouth s Hopkins Center for the Arts, a large building that is home to a number of performance spaces and many of the school s arts programs.Knesbach explained that,  knowing that Donald Trump was going to get a huge crowd, I asked for Spaulding Auditorium in an email to Laura LaMontagne, an events facilitator, around mid-August. I was told that it was a possibility, and we looked at availability. We were initially told, via email, that there might be a possibility of using Spaulding. Shortly thereafter, Knesbach and the College Republicans Vice President Charles Springer decided to expedite the process by going to see LaMontagne in person. Springer recalled that when they arrived to meet with her, they were joined by another college events staff member named Jim, who Campus Reform believes to be Jim Alberghini, the school s events manager. We were initially talking about using Spaulding as a venue for Trump,  Knesbach said,  Then they explained to us that Spaulding was managed by the Hopkins Center and generally only used for Hopkins Center events. Springer corroborated this statement saying,  [t]hey said that there were only very, very rare exceptions to this and that large expenses and bureaucratic drama were required to make the auditorium available for any event not run by the Hopkins Center. Knesbach explained that the administrators listed examples illustrating that they never allow presidential candidates to use the space. They told us that candidates like Howard Dean and Barack Obama could have filled up Spaulding but were not given the opportunity to use it,  Knesback said. Candidates never get Spaulding.  They said that word for word,  Springer reiterated.A series of email exchanges between Knesbach, college administrators, and the Trump campaign followed the in-person conversation. We told the Trump campaign that we could not secure Spaulding for a candidate event. Then they said that they couldn t visit because there was no indoor venue available that could seat at least 800 people,  said Knesbach,  I told the college via email that the Trump campaign required an indoor venue that could hold 800, and they replied that they could only offer us an outdoor location. As no space could be agreed upon, the Trump campaign decided to cancel its visit to Dartmouth College, choosing another New Hampshire location instead.This past Friday, Dartmouth College Democrats sent a campus-wide email advertising another campus visit by Hillary Clinton. Knesbach and Springer said they were taken aback when they learned of the event s location: Spaulding Auditorium.Despite the Clinton campaign claiming the speaking engagement to be an official campaign event, as evidenced by the screenshot above, Dartmouth s Director of Media Relations , Diana Lawrence, told Campus Reform that,  Spaulding is not available for rent by anyone, including political candidates. It is, however, available for use (through reservation) by campus groups holding College-sponsored events. Hillary Clinton s visit on Tuesday is an event sponsored by the Tuck School of Business as part of their presidential candidates  speakers series. Lawrence also pointed out that during the 2012 presidential election cycle Spaulding Auditorium was host to a Republican presidential debate; however thus far during the current election cycle no candidates have been granted access to the space.George Pataki, the former Republican governor of New York, and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham have already spoken at Dartmouth as part of the America s Economic Future series, co-sponsored by the Tuck School of Business and the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center. Neither spoke at Spaulding Auditorium.A spokesperson for the Trump campaign told Campus Reform that the claims made by the College Republicans are completely accurate and that the campaign was  told Spaulding Auditorium would be off limits to all presidential candidates this election cycle. The spokesperson added that the Trump campaign believes  this is a prime example of the school attempting to insert their bias onto the student population.  Via: Campus Reform",

        "title": "THIS STATE WILL INCLUDE TRANSGENDER CURRICULUM IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS: \u2018You can be both genders, you can be no gender, you can be a gender that you make up for yourself\u2019",
        "text": "Because there s nothing more compassionate than convincing young boys and girls that the gender that God assigned to them at birth means absolutely nothing. In fact, with a few government funded surgeries, they can try out any sex they think they might identify with You will want to contact the School Board if you live in Fairfax County, VA and let them know how you feel about using your tax dollars for the radical indoctrination of your children.One of the nation s largest public school systems is preparing to include gender identity to its classroom curriculum, including lessons on sexual fluidity and spectrum   the idea that there s no such thing as 100 percent boys or 100 percent girls.Fairfax County Public Schools released a report recommending changes to their family life curriculum for grades 7 through 12. The changes, which critics call radical gender ideology, will be formally introduced next week. The larger picture is this is really an attack on nature itself   the created order,  said Peter Sprigg of the Family Research Council. Human beings are created male and female. But the current transgender ideology goes way beyond that. They re telling us you can be both genders, you can be no gender, you can be a gender that you make up for yourself. And we re supposed to affirm all of it. The plan calls for teaching seventh graders about transgenderism and tenth graders about the concept that sexuality is a broader spectrum   but it sure smells like unadulterated sex indoctrination.Get a load of what the kids are going to be learning in middle school: Students will be provided definitions for sexual orientation terms heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality; and the gender identity term transgender,  the district s recommendations state.  Emphasis will be placed on recognizing that everyone is experiencing changes and the role of respectful, inclusive language in promoting an environment free of bias and discrimination. Eighth graders will be taught that individual identity  occurs over a lifetime and includes the component of sexual orientation and gender identity. Individual identity will also be described as having four parts   biological gender, gender identity (includes transgender), gender role, and sexual orientation (includes heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual). The district will also introduce young teenagers to the  concept that sexuality is a broader spectrum.  By tenth grade, they will be taught that one s sexuality  develops throughout a lifetime. Emphasis will be placed on an understanding that there is a broader, boundless, and fluid spectrum of sexuality that is developed throughout a lifetime,  the document states.  Sexual orientation and gender identity terms will be discussed with focus on appreciation for individual differences. As you might imagine   parents are freaking out. Parents need to protect their kids from this assault,  said Andrea Lafferty, president of Traditional Values Coalition.  Who could imagine that we are in this place today   but we are. Last week, the school board voted to include gender identity in the district s nondiscrimination policy   a decision that was strongly opposed by parents.Lafferty, who led the opposition to the nondiscrimination policy, warned that the district is moving towards the deconstruction of gender. At the end of this is the deconstruction of gender   absolutely,  she told me.  The majority of people pushing (this) are not saying that   but that clearly is the motivation. School Board spokesman John Torre told the Washington Times the proposed curriculum changes have nothing to do with last week s vote to allow boys who identity as girls to use the bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice.He would have us believe it was purely coincidental.To make matters worse, Lafferty contends parents will not be able to opt their children out of the classes because the lessons will be a part of the mandatory health curriculum.However, Torre told me that parents will indeed be able to opt out of those classes  including the sexual orientation and gender identity lessons. They are not being forthright with the information,  Lafferty said.  They are not telling people the truth. They are bullying parents. They are intimidating and they are threatening. I must confess that I m a bit old school on sex education. I believe that God created male and female. My reading of the Bible does not indicate there were dozens of other options.However, I m always open to learning new things   so I asked the school district to provide me with the textbooks and scientific data they will be using to instruct the children that there are dozens and dozens of possible genders.Here s the reply I received from Torre: Lessons have not been developed for the proposed lesson objectives,  he stated.  Because of the need to develop lessons, the proposed objectives would not be implemented until fall 2016. In other words   they don t have a clue.And the Family Research Council s Sprigg said there s a pretty good reason why they can t produce a textbook about fluidity. It s an ideological concept,  he told me.  It s not a scientific one. He warned that Fairfax County s planned curriculum could be harmful to students. It s only going to create more confusion in the minds of young people who don t need any further confusion about sexual identity,  he said.The board will introduce the changes on May 21. Lafferty said she hopes parents will turn out in force to voice their objections.Via: FOX News",

        "title": " Shameful: Republican Senate\u2019s New Scheme Is Going To Hurt Soldiers\u2019 Wallets Badly",
        "text": "Republicans have found a new way to hurt the pockets of the working class   and this time they re going so low as to strip pay away from military personnel. In June, the Republican-controlled Senate passed military budget cuts that no one asked for. Part of the budget calls for reforming how service members are compensated each month for their housing expenses.The way the current system works, service members receive a monthly stipend called the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). The amount of money service members received each month is based on several metrics such as rank, the number of dependents, and marital status. Service members are able to pocket any cash they have left over after they re housing expenses have paid for. That s all about to change.Mother Jones reports: The measure in the Senate bill, which passed with approval from the Armed Services Committee, would make the housing stipend cover only soldiers  actual bills.  Soldiers would provide copies of their rents or mortgages and get reimbursed only for what they spent, up to a maximum payable limit. Soldiers sharing housing would have their allowances divided by the number of service members sharing the space. The changes would cost many soldiers hundreds of dollars of a month. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the move would save $2 billion over the next five years. That $ 2 billion dollars in savings is just pennies compared to what has already been saved due to reforms in Tricare, the military s medical program. Todd Harrison, who works as the director of defense budget analysis for the Center for Strategic and International Studies told Mother Jones that: Just the minor changes that Congress has made to the Tricare program over the past four or five years [are] now saving more than $5 billion a year each year in the defense budget,  he says,  and I think a lot of people would be hard-pressed to identify what those changes are.  Harrison went on to add that,  They re cutting back on exactly the types of compensation that people value most. Fortunately, the changes to how the BAH runs are not included in the House s version of the spending bill. Furthermore, the Senate s version still has many legislative hurdles to jump over before it actually could be implemented.It shouldn t be too surprising that Republicans would seize the opportunity to turn the current the current need to reduce military spending into an austerity program. After all, the lower rungs of the military   those who will be impacted by this bill the most   are much more likely to be racial minorities and those with a poor working class background. It s just like the GOP to create programs that do not do much more than increase inequality in the name of fiscal responsibility.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",

        "text": "Donald Trump is a liar. Not the kind of lies that qualify as little white lies or harmless little fibs. He doesn t just exaggerate a little or embellish his stories. No, Donald Trump qualifies for full pants on fire status. A recent study of nearly 40 hours of campaign footage by Politico found that The Donald lies on average every five minutes. go ahead and read that again and take it in for all it s worth: Donald Trump tells a bald-faced lie every five minutes he s at a podium.His followers eat it up. Whether he s inventing numbers about trade deficits, creating success stories that definitely never actually happened to him or defending his bankruptcies, out-of-court settlements and failed business ventures, Donald Trump truly personifies the old adage that you can tell if he s lying if his lips are moving. Politico stated:We chronicled 4.6 hours of stump speeches and press conferences, from a rally in Concord, N.C., on Monday to a rally on Friday in St. Louis.The result: more than five dozen statements deemed mischaracterizations, exaggerations, or simply false   the kind of stuff that would have been stripped from one of our stories, or made the whole thing worthy of the spike. It equates to roughly one misstatement every five minutes on average.They also produced a video of some of those lies   captioned with the truth   for your viewing pleasure:How anyone can take this buffoon seriously is a mystery. While most Republicans are well-known for blaming the problems they and their party created for our country on Democrats, specifically President Obama, Trump is content to lie when the truth goes better. For example, we have a $366 billion trade deficit with China, which Trump has repeatedly exaggerated to $500 billion. Is that extra $134 billion really that important? Most middle and working class Americans struggle to keep $1000 in the bank, Donald. $366 billion more than makes the point.Another fan favorite is the ever-benevolent Trump and his  self-funded  campaign. Trump has passed the $7 million mark on donations from people who hit the big blue  donate  button on his website, and the bulk of his  self-funding  comes in the form of a $17.5 million loan from Donald J Trump. That loan can be repaid anytime up until shortly after his campaign ends. Trump s actual personal contributions total a little over $200K.That s how good  Christians  like Donald Trump operate. They hide behind lies. The truth that they are corporate lackeys looking to better their personal portfolios and secure a future for old, white, male America isn t so easy to campaign on, so they conjure a truth that fits their dialogue. In Trump s case, the truth is far more frightening than most, if not all, Republicans who have come before him: He wants the presidency so he can enjoy the pinnacle of power and blow things up.Not exactly a good enough reason to hand a lunatic the nuclear football but hey, you can t blame a megalomaniac for trying.Featured image from Gage Skidmore",

        "text": "Monday on CNBC, former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-FL) said due to the sexual misconduct accusations leveled against former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, he should step aside in his campaign for the U.S. Senate.Bush said,  This is not a question of innocence or guilt like in a criminal proceeding, this is a question of what s right and what s wrong. Acknowledging that you re dating teenagers when you re 32-years old as assistant state attorney is wrong. It s just plain wrong.

This is the sixth woman to publicly accuse the 41st president of grabbing her butt without consent.Speaking to Time magazine, Corrigan, who is now in her early 30s, said,  My initial action was absolute horror. I was really, really confused. The first thing I did was look at my mom and, while he was still standing there, I didn t say anything,  she said.  What does a teenager say to the ex-president of the United States? Like,  Hey dude, you shouldn t have touched me like that? Like the other five incidents, Corrigan claims it happened when she was posing with Bush for a photograph. Bush was then 79 years old. As soon as the picture was being snapped on the one-two-three he dropped his hands from my waist down to my buttocks and gave it a nice, ripe squeeze, which would account for the fact that in the photograph my mouth is hanging wide open,  Corrigan told Time.

        "title": "HUD ASKS FOR $4 BILLION MORE AFTER SPENDING MILLIONS ON LOBBYING CONGRESS???",
        "text": "The news broke this week that Obama wants to equalize housing for everyone. Social engineering is nothing new in this day of Obama. State s rights mean nothing to this group and if you disagree you re called a heartless racist. The HUD secretary, Julian Castro, was on Capitol Hill this week to testify about the HUD budget asking for $4 billion more. Below are two videos of Cong. Sean Duffy going at it with Castro. Please take the time to listen to the conversation. Castro gives ZERO information to Duffy. Doesn t that tell you something? HUD is just another bloated government entity that s actually lobbying the very body that they are part of Congress(see below)! Does this offend you as much as it does me?  In the new President s Budget, HUD s funding level will increase to $49.3 billion, nearly $4 billion more than Fiscal Year 2015 s enacted level.  A MUST WATCH! SEAN DUFFY(WI) WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO ACTUALLY ASKED CASTRO FOR SPECIFICS AND GOT NONE: The findings from HUD s internal watchdog expose a system in which offices around the country funded by the federal housing agency used tax dollars to campaign for favorable policies and larger budgets, government watchdogs found.The failure to police such expenditures gives good reason for taxpayers to be angry, experts told The Washington Times. You re using federal money to lobby Congress to get more federal money,  said Mark Calabria, a former HUD official who then spent seven years overseeing the agency as a Senate staff member working with the Banking Committee. This is directly taking money that has been allocated by Congress to helping poor people and it s being diverted to lobbying,  he said.Investigators said the housing agencies in cities across the U.S. failed to disclose roughly $2.5 million they spent on lobbying   and that was only at nine of the 12 agencies that report engaging in lobbying activities.However, watchdogs worry that undisclosed lobbying still could be occurring at the 3,200 other agencies HUD oversees, but which do not acknowledge engaging in any lobbying at all.For a lack of control that has allowed its various offices to violate transparency and spending laws   and take money that could have been used to provide housing   the Department of Housing and Urban Development wins this week s Golden Hammer, a distinction given out by The Washington Times to mark examples of waste, fraud and abuse with taxpayer money.The Philadelphia Housing Authority failed to disclose lobbying activities for which it spent as much as $660,000 during the period 2006 to 2010, the report found. It also improperly spent $48,500 in federal funds on lobbying activities conducted through law firms, which the agency should be required to repay, the HUD inspector general said.The Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh failed to disclose lobbying activities on which it improperly spent as much as $80,000 in federal funds in 2004 and 2005, and Home Forward in Portland, Oregon, failed to disclose lobbying activities conducted on its behalf.While inspectors think the examined housing agencies may have wasted only $129,000 in federal money, they cautioned the problem could be affecting many more offices than the ones investigators reviewed, and suggested a further investigation of the problem. Because HUD failed to implement adequate policies to monitor agencies  compliance with lobbying requirements HUD lacked assurance that other agencies did not spend Federal funds on lobbying activities or violate other lobbying-related requirements,  the inspector general report, released last week, found.HUD officials said the  extremely small sample size  investigators looked at does not warrant extensive changes at the agency to correct problems, and that additional steps to  obtain, track and retain lobbying certificates and disclosures is not a necessary remedy. In light of these facts, the recommendations are overly burdensome to implement in relation to limited error rate and limited staff resources,  said a letter signed by Milan Ozdinec, the deputy assistant secretary in charge of public housing. The suggestion that HUD staff take proactive steps to detect violations related to lobbying activities would present an enormous challenge to HUD staff,  the statement said.  To require staff to run queries on approximately 3,200 [public housing agencies] does not appear to be an effective control to cover 12 or so exception cases. The lobbying issues have escalated beyond the scope of a single watchdog, bringing in investigators from HUD s internal Office of Inspector General, the Government Accountability Office and the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Millions of Americans who have fallen on hard times   veterans, single mothers, their children   they all rely on HUD s programs,  said Rep. Sean Duffy, Wisconsin Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.The agency s funding  should not be diverted to illegal lobbying efforts or overpaying a lobbyist,  said Mr. Duffy, at a Wednesday committee hearing examining HUD s policies.Part of the problem, the inspector general report found, was that HUD rarely monitored the housing agencies and instead relied on their word they were complying with lobbying laws. HUD accepted and relied on agencies  certifications and disclosures without performing additional verification,  the IG report found.  HUD lacked reasonable assurance that agencies did not spend federal funds on lobbying activities, and the lack of accurate lobbying disclosures could create an appearance of a lack of transparency. HUD officials from the top down have urged their members and member agencies to lobby Congress in order to protect their interests.Last year, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan told an audience at the National Leagues of Cities Conference in Washington that local HUD officials should be lobbying their congressional representatives to restore funding to key programs.The same year, the agency s deputy secretary sent an e-mail to more than 1,000 people asking them to call senators in support of a funding bill for HUD, according to the Government Accountability Office. It is critical that your Senator hears from you NOW,  the e-mail read.  We need to maintain the current level of Republican support for the Senate [bill], acquire other Republican supporters and ensure vocal and active support from Democratic senators. The message then included a list of 17 U.S. senators that HUD wanted the public to focus on.Instead of using its time and resources lobbying Congress, HUD officials would be better off running their programs more efficiently, Mr. Calabria said. We the taxpayers are having to pay the public housing industry to lobby Congress on its own behalf,  said Mr. Calabria, the director of Financial Regulations Studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank.  If JP Morgan had used TARP money to go lobby Congress, we d all be greatly offended.

        "text": "Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez is in a tight spot. The DNC is broke and could use the money given to them by accused serial sexual assaulter  Harvey Weinstein.  Was Perez  non-answer on Friday a yes or a no? What would you bet the Democrats do? Will they return Weinstein s money like others have done or keep it?Weinstein is a longtime Democratic donor who has given $300,000 to the DNC. However, the DNC announced last week it was only donating $30,000 of that money. Furthermore, the groups getting the cash were openly pro-Democratic organizations Higher Heights, Emily s List, and Emerge America.After an event at the University of Wisconsin on Friday, Perez was asked by a tracker whether the DNC would return its contributions from Weinstein.IS THIS ALL THEY CAN SAY? You have a nice weekend, sir,  Perez said without looking.DNC VICE-CHAIR GETS TESTY TOO:DNC vice-chair Keith Ellison (D., Minn.) similarly dodged the question when asked about the subject on Wednesday. I don t have any comments for you right now. I don t know you, and I don t take questions like this,  Ellison said sharply.$4 MILLION IN DEBT!Under Perez, the DNC has struggled in fundraising and was more than $4 million in debt as of an August fundraising report.Weinstein s downfall in the aftermath of reports of his behavior has been swift. He has been fired from The Weinstein Company, and on Saturday the Oscar-winning producer was ousted from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.Dozens of women have accused Weinstein of harassment and abuse in the wake of bombshell reports from the New York Times and New Yorker.Weinstein has bundled or donated millions of dollars over the years for top Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, who have condemned his conduct and announced they are donating his contributions.Read more: WFB",

Well, a photograph has surfaced that perfectly demonstrates the hypocrisy of the  fornicate with the flag  movement or whatever those screaming about it are calling themselves these days.Trump fans love to wave around their American flags while screaming  America First  but when you look at the respect conservatives actually show for their flag and country, you have to consider having a physician on standby to prevent you from dying of laughter.One right-wing  protester  wearing a shirt that says  I STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM  was captured at a Jets game Sunday casually lounging on the same American flag he waves as he claims he s the biggest patriot in the history of patriotism with his trusty beer next to him.Deadspin reports that the person who snapped the photo saw the spectacle as they were walking with a friend through the stadium during the third quarter of the game. There is a huge tv screen by the food carts right inside the stadium where people gather to watch. We went over there to check it out and we saw him spread the flag out and sit down,  they said.  I thought it was too ironic so I snagged a picture. He sat on it for a few minutes before leaving. This is the reality of the  Patriots  on the Right. They talk a big game whenever they see a rainbow American flag or whenever an an African-American person is kneeling in front of one as the National Anthem plays.

Thank you to everyone, including the haters, for the great reviews of the speech!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 7, 2017Just to recap, Trump s speech included white supremacist code words such as  western values.  Trump also insulted the Polish people by downplaying the horrific experiences they suffered during World War II.On top of that, Trump attacked President Obama during a press conference and was snubbed by the Polish First Lady when he tried to shake her hand. Trump s visit to Poland was embarrassing, not  great. Trump then claimed that  everyone  is talking about Hillary Clinton s emails at the G-20.Everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 7, 2017This is incredibly doubtful. World leaders have way more important things to talk about. It s likely that Trump is the only one talking about Hillary s emails while the rest of the attendees are concerned with how Trump s meeting with Putin will affect Europe and NATO. After all, Trump still owes his puppet master a favor for putting him in the White House.Trump then ended his hissy fit by attacking the media.I will represent our country well and fight for its interests! Fake News Media will never cover me accurately but who cares! We will #MAGA!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 7, 2017This tweet actually contradicts his earlier tweet about his Poland speech. Trump thanks everyone, including the  haters,  for the  great  reviews of his speech. Now he is bitching because the media is allegedly covering him  inaccurately.

        "text": "UPDATE ON THE REDSKINS BATTLE WITH THE FEDS:ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP)   A federal judge has ordered the Patent and Trademark Office to cancel registration of the Washington Redskins  trademark, ruling that the team name may be disparaging to Native Americans.The ruling Wednesday by Judge Gerald Bruce Lee affirms an earlier finding by an administrative appeal board.In his 70-page ruling, Lee emphasized that the organization is still free to use the name if it wishes   the team would just lose some legal protections that go along with federal registration of a trademark.The team had sued to overturn a ruling against it by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. The team argued that cancellation of its trademark infringed on its free-speech rights because it required the government to judge whether the name is offensive.The organization can appeal.Via: scrippsmediaThe left is holding hostage new construction of the Washington Redskins stadium for a petty desire to get their way. Demanding a name change from the Redskins to something they consider more pc is total bs. The American Indians who have already responded in favor of keeping the team name understand the name isn t offensive and understand the history behind the name. This is just more of Obama s effort to cleanse our nation of anything HE deems offensive.Efforts to lure the Washington Redskins back to the District have come up against a potentially insurmountable challenge: the Obama administration s objections to the team s name.Interior Secretary Sally Jewell told D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser this spring that the National Park Service, which owns the land beneath Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, was unlikely to accommodate construction of a new stadium for the Redskins unless the team changes its name.Jewell oversees both national park land and America s trust and treaty relationships with Native American tribes.Her decision not to extend the District s lease of the RFK land badly hinders Bowser s bid to return the Redskins to D.C.   and boosts efforts to lure the team across the Potomac to Northern Virginia.Since joining the Obama administration two years ago, Jewell has repeatedly echoed the president s concern that the name is offensive to Native Americans. Last fall she called the name a  relic of the past  that should be changed. Personally, I think we would never consider naming a team the  Blackskins  or the  Brownskins  or the  Whiteskins.  So, personally, I find it surprising that in this day and age, the name is not different,  Jewell told ABC News.Jewell reiterated that position with Bowser (D) at an April 27 meeting, telling the mayor that she was unlikely to rework the lease terms for a stadium in part because of the team s name, according to a Department of the Interior spokeswoman, Jessica Kershaw.Team owner Daniel Snyder, who insists that the moniker honors Native Americans, has vowed never to change it.Bowser, jockeying with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) to land the team s new stadium, had inquired with Park Service officials about extending the District s lease for the RFK property to allow for a new stadium. Extending the lease would also require congressional action.[Tug of war for new Redskins stadium is complicated by name debate]Jewell  did mention in that meeting that she was uncomfortable with the name,  Kershaw said.  The president has said something similar, that he is uncomfortable with the name, and she clearly clarified that position. Read more: WaPo",

        "text": "Make no mistake about it, the NFL needs to show their fans that their players are serious about playing football, or the owners are going to continue to face catastrophic financial losses. The owners didn t hire Goodell to be their social justice director Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones led a conference call with 17 NFL owners on Thursday to discuss the possibility of halting commissioner Roger Goodell s pending contract extension.The owners on Thursday s conference call are unhappy with Goodell and the NFL s front office for a variety of reasons, including the player protests staged during the national anthem, issues regarding the relocation of teams to Los Angeles and the league s handling of the Ray Rice domestic violence case, sources told ESPN. You don t get to have this many messes over the years like Roger has had and survive it,  one owner said during the call.Sources have previously said that Jones has tried to stand in the way of any extension for Goodell.Last month, ESPN reported that Jones was impeding the progress of contract negotiations aimed at an extension for Goodell.  If not for Jerry,  one owner said last month in regard to the contract negotiations,  this deal would be done. The tension between Jones and Goodell is in part credited to the commissioner giving Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott a six-game suspension, which is currently being disputed in court.Another factor in the frustration with Goodell is the controversy surrounding players kneeling during the national anthem.Goodell won t mandate the players stand while Jones is threatening Cowboys onto their feet.Earlier this month, Jones said that any of his players who  disrespect  the flag won t be allowed to play. I know this, we cannot in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,  Jones, also the team s general manager, said after a 35-31 loss to the Green Bay Packers on October 8.The previous week, Jones knelt along with head coach Jason Garrett and all their players in the middle of the field on September 26 in a show of unity before they all stood for the anthem before their 28-17 win over the Arizona Cardinals. Spoke to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys yesterday. Jerry is a winner who knows how to get things done. Players will stand for Country!  President Trump tweeted.On the other side of the debate, Goodell strongly backed the players and criticized Trump for  an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL. For entire story- Daily Mail ",

        "text": "Just when you find yourself wondering if the world has gone completely mad you read a story like this that confirms that indeed, it has Gov. Jerry Brown is allowing parole for a transgender inmate who is trying to force California to become the first state to pay for sex reassignment surgery.A federal judge in April ordered the state to provide the surgery, which had been scheduled for July. It was delayed after the state appealed.The governor s office said Friday that Brown was taking no action on the Board of Parole Hearings  recommendation to release Michelle-Lael Norsworthy, which means her parole will proceed.The decision makes it less likely that the 51-year-old will be able to have surgery funded by the prison before she is released. Parole board spokesman Luis Patino said it usually takes about a week for an inmate to be released after the governor allows a parole to proceed.Brown decided Norsworthy is no longer dangerous, 30 years after she fatally shot Franklin Gordon Liefer Jr., 26, following an argument in a Fullerton bar in November 1985.Norsworthy, then 21, was convicted of second-degree murder after she shot Liefer three times. He died six weeks later.She is being held at Mule Creek State Prison, a men s prison in Ione, near Sacramento. Prison records refer to her by her birth name of Jeffrey Bryan Norsworthy, though she has lived as a woman since the 1990s.She was diagnosed with gender identity disorder in 1999 and began taking female hormones. She began asking the corrections department for the surgery in 2012 after learning a judge for the first time had ordered Massachusetts to provide an inmate with the procedure. However, that decision was overturned on appeal in December, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene.The 9th Circuit agreed to hear California s appeal of U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar s ruling and a hearing is scheduled for Thursday. The appellate court noted that the case raises serious legal questions about whether denying the surgery violates Norsworthy s constitutional rights against cruel and unusual punishment.The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation says it has met all of its legal requirements by providing Norsworthy with counseling and hormone therapy.The state filed paperwork in federal court Friday saying it has agreed to provide sex reassignment surgery for another inmate, Shiloh Quine, 56, to settle a separate lawsuit. CDCR evaluates every case individually, and in the Quine case, every medical doctor and mental health clinician who has reviewed this case, including two independent mental health experts, determined that this surgery is medically necessary for Quine,  corrections department spokesman Jeffrey Callison said in an emailed statement.Quine, formerly known as Rodney James Quine, is serving a life sentence for murder, kidnapping and robbery.Norsworthy testified at her parole hearing in May that she accepts responsibility for her crime. She said at the time, she was  pretty much drinking every day all day  but is now sober and attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in prison.She said she also takes steps to control her anger and make better judgments.Via: FOX News",

        "text": "Donald Trump has been on Twitter for nearly 48 straight hours, clearly making up for lost time during his international trip when his advisers took away his phone. The tweets have been all over the place, a sign of the sort of unhinged mania that has consumed Trump: angry messages directed at foreign leaders, defending Russia, lashing out at critics, and   now   defending his son-in-law Jared Kushner from disturbing allegations that he had gone behind the backs of America s intelligence community to set up a secret  backchannel  with Putin using Russian spy equipment.Numerous media organizations including the Washington Post and the New York Times have confirmed with reliable, high-ranking sources that Kushner did this. The evidence appears to be pretty damning. In fact, the White House seemed unable to defend Kushner. For the first few days after news broke, the only response from Trump supporters was that Kushner should have been allowed to do this.Trump, as he is known to do, imploded that argument with a single tweet. Posting a story from Fox News, Trump and the conservative channel are claiming that Kushner is completely innocent. Their  proof  is a single anonymous source that spoke only to Fox.During the meeting the Russians broached the idea of using a secure line between the Trump administration and Russia, not Kushner, a source familiar with the matter told Fox News. That follows a recent report from The Washington Post alleging that Kushner wanted to develop a secure, private line with Russia.The idea of a permanent back channel was never discussed, according to the source. Instead, only a one-off for a call about Syria was raised in the conversation.Sounds legit.This is a clear aboutface for Trump, who has lashed out at anonymous sources whenever they leak things that make him look bad. Suddenly, the mysterious anonymous source Fox found (or invented) to clear Kushner is completely trustworthy and Trump is back to loving sources again!Smarter people have reason to be skeptical. It s been said that Fox News under Trump has operated as little else than his state media to push his agenda and defend him from attacks. This latest story seems incredibly suspect. After days of reporters from numerous outlets confirming and re-confirming the original claims that Kushner had, in fact, tried to set up a back channel with the Russians, Fox News magically found a  source  that disproves all of it. This flies directly in the face of Trump s own national security advisor H.R. McMaster who, as part of his job to repeatedly humiliate himself in the name of Trump, claimed that Kushner was allowed to set up a back channel.Trump s attempt to save his son-in-law from a possible prison sentence actually may have made things worse. If the original defense of Kushner was that he was right to set up this secret channel with the Russians, Kushner will face a choice if he is ever subpoenaed: Lie about the backchannel to supporter his father-in-law s claim or admit he did talk to the Russians and expose Trump in yet another lie. Whether he then gets charged with perjury hangs on his answer.Kushner might need to have an uncomfortable talk with his father-in-law: Stop trying to help so I don t spend my life behind bars.Featured image via Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images",

        "text": "By now, the whole world knows that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (R-Of Course) was banned from an Alabama mall and the YMCA for creeping on little girls. He has been accused of molesting young girls as young as age fourteen. Of course, when the allegations first came out and the uproar and backlash began, everyone, regardless of politics, reacted with outrage. However, the GOP s outrage was often much more muted. Further, it took awhile for the Republican National Committee to pull their support for Moore, despite the deeply disturbing allegations of his being a pedophile. Well, now that the rage has died down, the RNC is back with a new message regarding this Senate race: Better a pedophile than a Democrat.Under cover of night, the RNC reinstated their support for Roy Moore, and an RNC official confirmed to The Hill that, quote, We can confirm our involvement in the Alabama Senate race. So, there you have it, folks. They literally want a child molester in the United States Senate rather than a Democrat. There are only a few voices from the right who are being brave on this one   and none of them are seeking re-election. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney tweeted that the GOP must not tolerate Moore:Roy Moore in the US Senate would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation. Leigh Corfman and other victims are courageous heroes. No vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity.  Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) December 4, 2017Outgoing Arizona GOP Senator Jeff Flake has actually said that he would vote for the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, if he lived in Alabama, and former Jeb Bush adviser Tim Miller has actually endorsed and donated to Jones. Outgoing Pennsylvania moderate Republican Charlie Dent said he never supported Moore in the first place. Here s the video of Dent s takedown of Moore:There is also outspoken Trump critic and longtime GOP strategist Steve Schmidt, who went on national television and called Moore a pedophile:Other than that, though, it has been radio silence. After all, they need that vote. Besides, let s face it   the GOP writ large showed America and the world what they stand for when they elected Donald Trump.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",

        "text": "Here s yet another reason to be very suspicious of the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton:Via Free Beacon: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton struck a deal with the State Department while serving in the Obama administration that allowed her to take ownership of records she did not want made public, according to recently released reports.Clinton and her then-deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin were permitted to remove electronic and physical records under a claim they were  personal  materials and  unclassified, non-record materials. Judicial Watch made the revelation after filing a FOIA request with the State Department and obtaining a record of the agreement:The newly released documents show the deal allowed Clinton and Abedin to remove documents related to particular calls and schedules, and the records would not be  released to the general public under FOIA.  Abedin, for instance, was allowed to remove electronic records and five boxes of physical files, including files labeled  Muslim Engagement Documents. The released records included a list of designated materials that  would not be released to the general public under FOIA  and were to be released  to the Secretary with this understanding.

He started out by telling them:  For those who find it difficult to understand to understand that the American people voted for Donald Trump, get over it because he s President of the United States. Evans reminded the members of Parliament that the  Brexit  was also a referendum handed down by British voters to members of Parliament who have forgotten them.  We have to ask ourselves, and this actually includes myself, is that we have to ask ourselves, why is it that people felt so left behind that they ve made the democratic decisions that they have?

        "text": "Robert Reich is one of the most respected voices in politics. He also has many friends who are current and former elected officials. He recently posted a most disturbing conversation he had with a friend who just happens to be a former GOP congressman on Facebook, and it exposes just how crazy the Donald Trump phenomenon is, and how much control Trump and his crazy supporters have over the Republican Party. Here is the transcript of that post:Yesterday I spoke with a former Republican member of Congress whom I ve known for years.Me: What do you think of your party s nominee for president?He: Trump is a maniac. He s a clear and present danger to America.Me: Have you said publicly that you won t vote for him?He (sheepishly): No.Me: Why not?He: I m a coward.Me: What do you mean?He: I live in a state with a lot of Trump voters. Most Republican officials do.Me: But you re a former official. You re not running for Congress again. What are you afraid of?He: I hate to admit it, but I m afraid of them. Some of those Trumpistas are out of their fu*king minds.Me: You mean you re afraid for your own physical safety?He: All it takes is one of them, you know.Me: Wait a minute. Isn t this how dictators and fascists have come to power in other nations? Respected leaders don t dare take a stand.He: At least I m no Giuliani or Gingrich or Pence. I m not a Trump enabler.Me: I ll give you that.He: Let me tell you something. Most current and former Republican members of Congress are exactly like me. I talk with them. They think Trump is deplorable. And they think Giuliani and Gingrich are almost as bad. But they re not gonna speak out. Some don t want to end their political careers. Most don t want to risk their lives. The Trump crowd is just too dangerous. Trump has whipped them up into a g*ddamn frenzy.And here is the embed:This is what has happened to one of America s two major political parties. They have propped up a literal fascist and are currently doing all they can to put him in the Oval Office and give him control of the most dangerous nuclear arsenal in the world. That is frighteningly, chillingly irresponsible. If we all die, you know who to thank.These people are cowards, and you cannot be a leader and a coward at the same time. They have no leadership skills. Part of being a good leader is doing the right thing when it counts, and it s clear that the current GOP leadership is incapable of doing that.All I can hope is that the entire GOP is just like Reich s friend   and when they enter the privacy of the voting booth, they vote to save the world from that lunatic that somehow rose to the top of the GOP presidential ticket, rather than voting to save their own political hides.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",

        "title": "BOMBSHELL CASE: Illegal Alien Voting Cover-Up Exposed as Virginia Governor Blamed for Thousands Casting Ballots",
        "text": "Thank goodness for President Trump s new commission because the latest finding on voter fraud is just the tip of the voter fraud iceberg:HERE S WHAT S GOING ON:When Maureen Erickson registered to vote in Prince William County, she listed her home address as a street in Guatemala, in what should have been a very strong indication that she wasn t a regular Virginia resident. Yet she remained on the voting rolls for years, and even cast ballots in 14 different elections, up through the 2008 presidential contest. She was only purged in 2012, just ahead of the election, after she self-reported as a noncitizen, according to a new report released Tuesday by the Public Interest Legal Foundation. Ms. Erickson was one of more than 5,500 noncitizens who were registered to vote in Virginia this decade, and were only bumped from the rolls after they admitted to being ineligible. Some 1,852 of them even managed to cast ballots that were likely illegal, though undetected, the PILF, a conservative voter integrity group, said in its report. Just as troubling, the PILF said, was Virginia s efforts to try to hide the information from the public   a problem foundation President J. Christian Adams said began at the very top, with Gov. Terry McAuliffe.  At the instruction of Governor McAuliffe s political appointees, local election officials spent countless resources to prevent this information from spilling into the open,  Mr. Adams said in a statement releasing the report.  From NoVa to Norfolk and all urban and rural points in between, alien voters are casting ballots with practically no legal consequences in response.  READ MORE: WTNEW REPORT:A new report released shortly after the forming of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity finds that more than 5,000 individuals were determined to be non-U.S. citizens registered to vote in Virginia. Dubbed a  sequel  to a similar 2016 effort, the latest study found 5,556 voters were  quietly removed  from the records for reasons related to non-citizenship  between 2011 and May 2017,  according to an advanced look at the findings provided by the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF). Of the total registered, one-third of unlawful voters managed to cast ballots leading to a total of more than 7,400 illegal votes cast, according to the report.The organization points out that it was unable to find any evidence that illegal registrations or votes were ever prosecuted.The report details how ineligible individuals are slowly discovered by local officials most often, the authors allege, by accident. Applicants for voter registration are not required to prove they are actual U.S. citizens in Virginia. The vast majority of states only require that people claim to be citizens during registration, PILF notes. The report details, however, that Virginia shares information when a claimed citizen indicates otherwise to a separate state agency. At that point, removal procedures begin:In the absence of regular data-sharing arrangements between federal officials and the Commonwealth, the ability of election officials to identify aliens on the voter rolls is almost nonexistent.The most that happens in Virginia is that an alien on the voter rolls will sometimes tell the state DMV they are not a citizen. Without those leads, counties and municipalities must accept false claims of citizenship on their face.The authors also shared with this reporter examples of how some ineligible noncitizens admitted their immigration statuses at the outset, but were still registered to vote. Some illegal registrants lasted on the rolls for years risking possible deportation until they were discovered.Read more: Breitbart",

        "text": "On July 9, a 28-year-old Washington man broke into the home of Sikh/Hindu family, holding them at knife point.Preet Moudgil manages the Kettle Falls Inn, located in Kettle Falls, Washington. He and his family, including his parents and three-year-old son, also live on the premises.According to the Spokesman-Review, Moudgil was working the desk at the motel when Kilgore first approached him. He made several racist comments during the encounter, and asked him if he  knew about Guantanamo Bay. Later Kilgore attempted to break down the door that separates Moudgil s apartment from the motel office, but was unsuccessful. He then tried to enter through a second door, located on the first floor. Moudgil locked all the doors and windows to the apartment. Kilgore managed to get inside through a sliding glass door, which he reached by going to the roof of the motel.Once inside the apartment, Kilgore began threatening the family at knife-point. He said  I m going to cut you up because you are a terrorist,  Moudgil told the Spokesman-Review.  All he saw was brown skin. Kilgore shoved Moudgil s elderly father, turning the knife on him. He told the family,  I was trained to kill people like you. Moudgil s father eventually managed to escape the apartment. His mother fled through a back entrance as well, taking the three-year-old child with her.According to the Spokesman-Review, a neighbor finally managed to subdue the man, wrestling the knife away from him before he was able to seriously injure someone.Kilgore was arrested and is facing two counts of second-degree assault, one count of burglary and one count of malicious mischief. Additional charges may be added in the future. He is currently being held on $100,000 bond.Moudgil says that he has lived in the Kettle Falls community for years.  This community is very small. Everybody knows everybody,  he told the Spokesman-Review. Yet he says that he has never heard anything like this happening in the community before.The rise of racist, right-wing hatemongers like Donald Trump, who spew anti-Muslim ignorance and bigotry on a national platform, is undoubtedly linked to the growing number of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the U.S.As The New York Times reported here, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of attacks against members of the Muslim community over the past 10 months.As long as people like Donald Trump are allowed to spew their hateful, racist views on a national stage, the situation will only continue to get worse.Image credt: Viktoria-Lyn Deviant Art CC 3.0 ",

The family has relatives visiting and two kids home from college.  They got a visit Friday from code enforcement, acting on an anonymous complaint. The neighborhood is zoned an Open Space Community. A recent rule changed, and enacted a limit of two cars parked in the drive.  After Channel 2 consumer investigator Jim Strickland got the county on the phone, officials decided to let the issue slide this summer, but put the family on notice next summer would require a permit to park four cars in the driveway. I m having to pay to park on a property that I already pay tax on,  said [Kim] Oviedo.But think how grateful the polar bears will be!Cobb County s Open Space Community zoning was  established to encourage the preservation of natural resources within residential development.

        "text": "All the progress that s been made with race relations in America since the civil rights era has been ignored by so many angry blacks who ve bought into the carefully orchestrated Obama, Sharpton and Holder race war funded by their friend, George Soros. Since the liberal mainstream media wants to use the horrific massacre in Charleston to attack conservatives, disparage white people and act as if Dylann Roof s actions represent a normalcy, I thought it only fair to bring up the case of a black woman from Charleston, Sista Solove, who this week essentially asserted that white supremacy is leading us towards a race war against  crackas. She made the statement on Wednesday while speaking with Breitbart Texas editor Brandon Darby outside the Mother Emmanuel American Methodist Church in Charleston.When he asked her what she thinks will ultimately result from Roof s actions, she replied,  The real question is   if it were the other way around, what would that be? https://youtu.be/_o-rzGRSu8sIf a black person   if a nigga killed nine crackas, he would be dead. We wouldn t even be talking about his raggedy ass. Okay. But this cracka is,  Oh, he s mentally ill. Oh, ya know, pray for him. Oh, they ve got support systems for him.No, it s an agenda, and there s going to be a race war because it continues to happen. You cannot go pray. You can t be a child at a playground. You can t wear a hoodie with Skittles. You can t be black.What s a good nigga supposed to do, Massa? What s a good nigga supposed to do not to get shot? That s a good question, ain t it?The reason Roof happens to be alive to this day is because he complied with police orders and did not resist arrest. This places him in stark contrast to the likes of, say, Mike Brown and Eric Garner.The comment about  a child at a playground  referred to 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who died in an unfortunate incident after a bystander reported  a male sitting on a swing and pointing a gun at people.  The gun turned out to be fake, though according to reports, Rice reached for it when the cops told him to put his hands up.And as for the comment about how  you can t wear a hoodie with Skittles,  that referred to Trayvon Martin, who was justifiably shot by George Zimmerman after he attacked the guy for no legitimate reason whatsoever.Anyway. Sista Solove then delivered what Breitbart contributor Lee Stranahan accurately described as  the academic Marxist message of  white privilege  that underscores the current Black Lives Matter movement :It s called white privilege. You don t understand where our anger comes from. No one gets it. Our history comes from our family telling us,  Oh, you can t be black. Don t do this, don t go to that fountain, don t do this  and we re still dealing with this shit. What are we going to do with the anger? What are we going to do with the anger?

        "text": "Whether you realize it or not, the Second Amendment only applies to white people. While open carrying firearms is dangerous and stupid, Mark Hughes decided to bring his gun to a protest in Dallas   something that is legal under current laws in Texas and that made him a convenient target for police when other people began shooting.Almost as soon as bullets started flying, Hughes  photo was blasted all over social media (as of now, his photo is still up on the Dallas Police Department s Twitter timeline as a  suspect ):As soon as he learned that police were attempting to scapegoat him, Hughes did something we typically don t see from open carriers: he located officers, turned himself and his weapon in, and cleared the situation up (unless, of course, you happen to be looking at DPD s Twitter). But while he did everything correctly (besides, of course, bringing a gun to a peaceful protest in the first place), Hughes was put through hell at the police department.Officers told their target that they had evidence linking him to the shootings of five police officers. After he was released from custody, he told CBSDFW: I just got out of an interrogation room for about 30 minutes, where police officers were lying, saying they had video of me shooting a gun, which is a lie, saying that they had witnesses saying I had shot a gun, which is a lie. At the end of the day  the system was trying to get me. Hughes says that police have not once bothered to apologize to him for dragging his name through the mud and that he has received non-stop death threats since his photo was released with the  suspect  label.Man wrongly labeled as person of interest in #dallaspoliceshooting \"I can't believe it.I can't believe it.\" Via KTVT pic.twitter.com/n37cY7h9hk  Dr. Seema Yasmin (@DoctorYasmin) July 8, 2016It might seem shocking, even unthinkable that police lied to him in an effort to coerce a confession, but that s perfectly legal. While it is a crime for you to lie to police, attorney Chris Burney writes in a blog post discussing myths related to criminal law:Cops are allowed to lie about anything.Let s repeat that: The police are allowed to lie to you  about anything.The most common example of this is police interrogation.  The cops are allowed to use any deception they like, in order to get a confession.For example, they can tell you your partner s being interrogated upstairs, and just confessed, so you d better come clean if you know what s good for you (when they haven t even arrested your partner yet.)  They can say the victim told them you did it before she died (when she s actually still alive, and never said anything of the sort).The biggest lie (and one that works all the time) is that this conversation is strictly off the record.   Just between you and me.  Nothing you ever say to a police officer is ever off the record.  If it can be used against you, it will.The second-biggest lie (also one that works all the time) is that, if you come clean, the officer will make sure you get treated leniently.  He ll make sure the DA gives you a lighter charge.  He ll put in a word with the judge to make sure you get off with a lighter sentence.  He ll only arrest you for the misdemeanor.  Complete horseshit, of course   that cop s going to make sure you go down for whatever it is you just confessed to   but it works all the time.  People cut their losses, seeing themselves in a hopeless situation, and grasp at the opportunity to at least minimize the bad.Oh, and if you think innocent people don t do that too, then you ve got another think coming.  Innocent people do confess to crimes they didn t commit, for a variety of reasons.  (That s a subject for a whole nother myth.)  And lying cops is one of the big ones.And the cops are completely within their rights to lie this way.  Unlike prosecutors and judges, who have professional ethics to comply with, the police are allowed to use whatever lawful tools they have in order to solve a crime.  It s not against the law for them to lie.  They re allowed to.And so they will.  They re trained to do it.  They re supposed to do it.  They re gonna do it.In this case, police were hoping to wrap things up quickly with a confession from an innocent man. Fortunately, it didn t work this time.Featured image via screengrab",

        "text": "This story of corruption and collusion is MIND BOGGLING! The manipulation of American voters is beyond comprehension Researchers and political analysts frequent CTH because we bring you hard, factual, and fully cited research enabling you to make up your own mind about the headlines.What you are about to read (and see) below is a fully cited example of something we have discussed frequently, but withheld until today, so the oppositional forces cannot change strategies in their attempts to manipulate your mind.It is now time to lay all media polling naked for you to grasp. Everything below is fully cited so you can fact-check it for yourself. However, we present this with a disclaimer: the entities exposed will industriously work to change their approach from this day forth.You have probably seen the latest example of the media claiming a released presidential poll from NBC and The Wall Street Journal as an example of Hillary Clinton expanding to an 11 point lead in the weekend following the  controversial  leaked tape of Donald Trump.The claim is complete and utter nonsense. Here s the proof.We begin with a google search showing hundreds of media citations referencing the NBC/WSJ Poll:And here s the NBC link to the poll, and the NBC Link to the pdf of the poll, and the NBC Poll itself in a scribed pdf:Transparently the poll is manipulated with: a) a small sample (500); and b) the following ideological make-up:By itself that ideological snapshot is silly. Nationally the party registration is roughly 27% (R), 32% (D), and 40% (I) However, the polling sample is the least of the issues for this deconstruction.Arguing about the construct or methodology of the poll is typically what most people do when they are refuting a media poll. That aspect alone is not the big story.Hart Research Associates is headed up by Peter D Hart (founder), and Geoff Garin (President)   SEE HERENow look at what role Geoff Garin, Hart Research Associate President, is currently occupying (link here):OK, so Mr. Geoff Garin, the President of Hart Research and Associates , is currently working as  a strategic adviser for Priorities USA in support of Hillary Clinton s election . Gee, I wonder why the media never tells us that part?See the issue?Here are some recent tweets from Geoffrey Garin (the impartial pollster):In his sex scandal Trump remains the master of the double entendre. pic.twitter.com/SP1N4WPHJI  Geoff Garin (@geoffgarin) October 8, 2016Here is the VERY SCUMMY Geoff Garin arguing with Obama s equally scummy Senior Advisor David Axelrod in 2008 on Meet the Press:Wait, we re not even close to finished. It gets better.Let s take a look at the recent financial connection between, Geoff Garin, Hart Research Associates and Hillary Clinton s Priorities USA Super-PAC.For that information we turn to FEC filings -HERE-. What do they indicate?On Page #118 of the September 2016 (most recent) filing we find a payment for $178,500 (screen grab above)On Page #92 of the same September 2016 (most recent) filing, we find another payment for $42,000 (screen grab below)  $220,500.00 in the month of September alone paid by Hillary Clinton s Priorities USA Super-PAC to Hart Research Associates.  The President of Hart Research Associates, Geoff Garin, is working for Hillary Clinton s campaign.  NBC (S Burke) and The WSJ (Murdoch) contact Geoff Garin (Hart Research Associates) for the post-debate poll data they will use on the day following the debate.  Hart Research Associates provides a small national poll sample (500) result, with skewed party internals, showing Hillary Clinton +11 points.Via: Conservative Treehouse",

Especially by those in authority.King was shaking up business as usual, and many, many people didn t like that. You can t change the world without ruffling a few feathers, and he definitely did that.In fact, here s an uncensored letter from the FBI to Dr. King that was posted by The New York Times from the National Archives.It read: KING,In view of your low grade, abnormal personal behavior I will not dignify your name with either a Mr. or a Reverend or a Dr. And, your last name calls to mind only the type of King such as KingHenry the VIII and his countless acts of adultery and immoral conduct lower than that of a beast. Click the image to read the letter in full:National Archives via NY TimesThey tell him: There is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. They are basically telling Dr. King to kill himself, and giving him a deadline or they ll  out  him, so to speak for all these allegedly evil doings. It s absurd, to be blunt. Absolutely disgusting, to be honest.While the nation praises Dr. King today, we cannot forget how ugly the past truly was, and horribly he was treated. This letter was sent only about 50 years ago. So, we ve come a long way in a short amount of time, but we still have such a long way to go.Featured image via J. Wilds/Keystone/Getty Images",

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 7, 2017Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are the same program and even conservatives rely on it. The program has saved lives and given tens of millions of Americans access to health insurance that they previously could not afford.Trump has repeatedly tried to strip healthcare away from millions of Americans by pushing for repeal of the law and his administration has been chipping away at the Affordable Care Act to make it weaker so that Trump can sit on his ass and tweet about how the program is  failing. Those who have insurance thanks to Obamacare were quick to jump down Trump s throat and reminded him that s he s the one who is victimizing people.Obamacare victims? That s rich coming from someone who is pushing hard to yank 23M citizens off of healthcare.

Surprising in this day of technology where everything is recorded.How would Hillary s narrative of  chastising the big banks  actually hold up compared to what she actually said???

Tucker Carlson calls them out on their lies: Let s stop lying about this. The calls we are hearing today for gun control have nothing to do with protecting Americans from violence. What you re witnessing is a kind of class war. The left hates rural America, red America, gun-owning America, the America that elected Donald Trump. They hate them. Progressives are still in charge of most of the major institutions in this country, and they despise the autonomy of an armed population. They want collective punishment for the sins of a few. They seek to obliterate a core constitutional right rather than trying to mitigate its downsides. They call it gun control, but it s not. It s people control.

He can tweet all he wants about how it s anyone s fault but his, and yet, he s the one who took executive action to end subsidies for low-income Americans. And Charles isn t the only one coming up with horrific numbers, either. The Kaiser Family Foundation has done their own analysis and come up with some pretty damning numbers as well.The worst part is that the markets were starting to stabilize going into this year, which meant premium hikes would likely have slowed for next year, and maybe even started coming down in following years. Instead, they re now skyrocketing. Polls have also consistently shown growing support for fixing the ACA instead of repealing it. What Trump and his party did was a planned and deliberate political move to harm Obama s legacy without caring who else they hurt.These extreme premium hikes are on Trump s and the GOP s heads.

        "text": "Do we even need to ask how 16 white West Point cadets posing in uniform, with a white power fist before graduation would have been resolved? Never mind the media circus it would have created Sixteen black West Point cadets who posed with raised fists for a pre-graduation picture that sparked debates on race and proper behavior in uniform won t be punished for the gesture, the U.S. Military Academy said Tuesday.The decision, less than two weeks before the 16 female seniors are poised to graduate, found they didn t violate any U.S. Department of Defense rules limiting political activity.An internal inquiry  found that the cadets did not pre-plan or set out to make a political statement,  West Point s superintendent, Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen Jr., said in a letter to the student body.But, he said, they showed  a lapse of awareness in how symbols and gestures can be misinterpreted and cause division  and they will get some instruction on that.The fists-up image, which circulated online, led some observers to question whether the women were expressing support for the Black Lives Matter movement, which grew out of protests over police killings of unarmed black men.But the inquiry found the picture, one of multiple photos the women made in keeping with an informal campus tradition, captured a spur-of-the-moment gesture intended to demonstrate unity and pride in graduating, Caslen wrote. Groups of cadets often take Old Corps pictures in traditional dress uniforms to echo historical portraits.A raised fist has symbolized political resistance for generations, from Nelson Mandela upon his release from prison in 1990 to Democratic Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on the presidential campaign trail this year. It was used by black power advocates in the 1960s, including by two American sprinters during a medal ceremony at the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games, and more recently by activists for the Black Lives Matter movement.Some observers suggested the women were improperly identifying with the movement while in uniform.Defenders said the women were simply celebrating their forthcoming graduation, something closer in spirit to a team lifting helmets to celebrate a win or Beyonce raising her fist at this year s Super Bowl halftime show.

        "text": "It s time to shut them down. Permanently.On Sunday evening, 64-year-old Stephen Craig Paddock poured gunfire on a concert at the Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, Nevada from his hotel room at Mandalay Bay.22,000 people were in attendance. 50 were killed and over 400 were wounded.Paddock fired  clip after clip after clip  from his assault rifle and the carnage stopped when police shot him dead.In Nevada, machine guns are legal and can be openly carried.Stricter gun laws might have prevented Paddock from acquiring the weapon he used to kill so many people.But the National Rifle Association has continued defending gunmen like Paddock for years by arguing that guns of any kind should be in the hands of every American.Thousands of Americans have died because of this irresponsible stance, and you can bet that the NRA will say that  now is not the time to discuss our gun laws  while at the same time only offering  thoughts and prayers  to the victims and their families instead of doing something that will actually prevent future mass shootings.It s a script that we have witnessed time and time again, and it has to be stopped.The NRA has become nothing more than a for-profit terrorist organization that makes money every time an American is killed by a gun. The NRA claims that  good guys with guns  will stop the bad guys from killing us. Tell that to the 50 human beings who were killed.They were just attending a concert when a man started firing from a hotel window. No  good guy with a gun  could have stopped him, but stricter gun laws could have kept the gun he used out of his possession in the first place. The NRA andThe NRA and their bought and paid for Republican lawmakers, including Donald Trump, will claim that stricter gun laws won t prevent such shootings. They are lying, pure and simple.Thus far, the NRA has remained silent about this mass shooting, and Americans across the country are severely pissed off at them.Ya.

        "text": "There may have been a time, many years ago, when the Republican party gave a crap about its constituents, but those days are long gone. If you haven t seen enough proof of that yet, all you have to do is watch this snippet from a Rep. Darrell Issa town hall in San Diego, California to see where he mocks a constituent who claimed to be assaulted by one of Issa s staff.The woman, who said she is a member of California s Bar (a lawyer) and that she was holding a sign at the town hall which was taken away from her by Issa s  bodyguard,  whom she said assaulted her. I had a very small sign that said, Investigate Russia now,  she explained to the congressman standing on the stage.  There are many other people with signs here. You bodyguard, security guard, came over and took my sign away from me forcibly. I asserted my 1st Amendment rights of free speech. I told him it was suppression of speech. Source: Raw StoryIssa tried blaming it on the size of her sign. Apparently, oversized signs were banned from the event, but the woman insisted it was small. He did apologize, but the woman persisted. Mine was small and it was forcibly taken from me and it constituted a battery,  the woman asserted.  It was your staff. They committed a criminal offense against me. At that point, Ryan had had enough with the woman and said,  well, okay,  while grabbing the mic and said,  We ll go on to somebody who doesn t have a pending lawsuit. The crowd, thankfully, booed.Here s the video:Sadly, this seems to be common behavior among Republicans. Dissent is no longer welcome. They re even attempting to make protesting illegal, or at least very difficult, in many states. In Michigan, for example, lawmakers tried to pass a law that would make picketing illegal by charging a $1,000 fine for each day of picketing. Fortunately, the state Senate didn t pass it, but other bills are even more frightening.In North Dakota, for example, Republicans introduced a bill that would make it legal to run down protesters with cars.Of course, we have an Oval Office occupier who believes that all dissent is  fake  and needs to be shut down.

The letter says,  The video allegedly seeks to  stop the bullying  of Barron Trump. Not true   The video did instigate further bullying by Rosie O Donnell and others. https://youtu.be/yZAd5Pu9iw4The video lists a number of signs it claims points to autism, including Barron clapping without slapping his hands together. Melania s attorney, Charles J. Harder, says Barron did this once   at the end of a long day at the RNC   but the  vast majority of the time, he claps normally. The video shows Barron yawning and grimacing during his father s victory speech at the RNC and on election night. Melania s team says both events were late at night, and Barron was exhibiting normal behavior for a 10-year-old.Melania is not threatening to sue Rosie, but her attorney, Harder, wants the person who posted the YouTube clip to delete it and post an apology.Our sources say Melania is outraged and is serious about going after the person who posted the video if he doesn t take it down.",

        "text": "Hillary Clinton was dogged throughout her campaign by her decision to set up a private email server in the basement of her suburban New York home to handle communications as secretary of state. Comey said in July that agents found 110 classified emails containing emails that were classified at the time they were sent or received. That included eight marked  top secret. Although Comey labeled Clinton s behavior  extremely careless,  he added that it did not warrant prosecution.We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial e-mail accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton s use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton s personal e-mail account.  James Comey on Hillary s server  Lifezette And here is the hilarious version of Comey Vs. Clinton. Enjoy! All kidding aside Even if we assume Comey didn t botch the Clinton email investigation   which is quite an assumption to make, especially considering how outraged so many investigators in the FBI were in the weeks and months following Comey s announcement   why did the FBI director continue to comment on ongoing investigations? Why did he continue to feed red meat to wolves on both sides of the aisle in Congress?The FBI, regardless of Comey s intentions, has now become a blunt political tool that s being wielded by some of the most dishonest, power-hungry people in the country: politicians. That s not only foolish and reckless, it s dangerous to liberty and undermines the credibility of a group of people that must appear credible in the minds of the people for justice to be served and for liberty to endure.The American people deserve better from their FBI director, and if Comey proves to be incapable of exercising greater prudence, perhaps it s time for someone more careful and considerate to take the helm at one of the world s most powerful government agencies. -The Blaze",

        "text": "If you re sitting at your computer, take a deep breath. If you re reading this on your phone, have a seat. Everything you think you know about how bad the Trump administration s response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico has been is about to get a whole lot worse.On Rachel Maddow s show Monday night, she discussed a small town in the mountains of Puerto Rico called Aibonito, roughly one and a half hours from the capital city of San Juan. If it seems like you re getting a geography lesson lately, that s good   even if it is because of listening to Trump trash talk mayors and citizens or watching him pelt churchgoers with rolls of paper towels.Showing video taken from a moving vehicle, Rachel describes the roads from the capital to Aibonito: Clear. Unblocked. As the cameras travel with the MSNBC team, you hear the point of Rachel s report, which is that after almost three weeks since the storm, FEMA still has not brought relief to the mountain town. And to hear them tell it, there s a reason.It s not their job.FEMA still has not delivered food or water to the completely accessible town. And make no mistake, FEMA knows that Aibonito is accessible at this point, because they ve been there three times. All three times, FEMA was on the scene to  help residents fill out paperwork  to apply for aid. Let s drag that acronym out into what it stands for: The Federal Emergency Management Agency. Heading to a remote mountain town that s been waiting three weeks for food and water to assist the pueblo in asking for help doesn t sound like anyone is managing any emergencies to me.Rachel first ran a profile on Aibonito on Friday, which is how she knew that FEMA had been there three times. After she ran that report, FEMA contacted her show, desperate to let the public know that they had once again made the literally unimpeded journey to Aibonito on Saturday, this time to speak to the mayor and file a report on the needs of the community. Still no food or water in their undoubtedly spacious trucks.The death toll in Puerto Rico has more than doubled since Donald Trump told the residents there that they should be grateful so few had died.But the part that will piss you off is the comparison between how the Trump administration has handled this  emergency management  as opposed to the emergencies in Texas and Florida. Shipping restrictions are back in place in Puerto Rico, making what little aid is coming hard to receive. The administration initially refused to lift a restriction on using food stamps to purchase ready-to-eat food, despite the grocery stores on the island being mostly closed until within the last week, and despite those stores that have reopened jacking up their prices. That s not how it went in the mainland US, where the  white people s hurricanes  saw victims able to use their food stamps to purchase McDonald s on day one, and where the federal government stepped in to help municipalities fight price gouging.There can be little doubt that the  emergency management  in Puerto Rico has suffered from a lack of compassion, and that erasing everything that puertorrique os have in common with Texans and Floridians   American citizenship, basic humanity, dire need   what s left is that they are a Spanish-speaking people. They are brown and seem foreign. They are underdogs, with a flag that isn t the same shape as the flags of the individual United States that fly at the same height: Just below the American flag.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",

        "title": "STAR WARS 2.0: Washington\u2019s Battle to Fund Space Warfare",
        "text": "21st Century Wire says In 1983, US President Ronald Reagan launched the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a space-based anti-missile system which came to be known as  Star Wars.  At the time, SDI was meant to give the US a nuclear first-strike against advantage against its geopolitical rival the Soviet Union by using various weaponized technologies including lasers, to intercept Soviet ICBM missiles in space. In the end, the program proved to be too costly, too complicated for a practical role out, and ineffective against non-space faring weapons like cruise missiles, submarine based missile batteries and long range bombers.  Now in 2017, as the Cold War is being re-heated again, the West is potentially looking at the complete militarization of outer space. This time the US nemesis is both Russia and China. But what really driving this new  space race  agenda?Consortium News Exclusive: As a backdrop to the Russia-gate hysteria and the heightened fear of China is a budget war over how much U.S. taxpayer money to pour into space warfare, explains Jonathan Marshall By Jonathan MarshallThere s a civil war being fought on our nation s soil, right in our capital. It pits the Secretary of Defense and senior generals against a bipartisan band of militant legislators who accuse the Pentagon of standing pat while Russian and China work to achieve military superiority over the United States in space.No doubt these bureaucratic warriors will eventually call a truce. But in the meantime, the American people will almost certainly become less secure and more indebted (in budget terms) as a result of both sides  macho posturing for new warfighting capabilities in space (differing mostly on how far and how fast to go).Eager congressional advocates of space warfare have attached an amendment to the House defense authorization bill requiring the Pentagon to create a new U.S. Space Corps to join the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard by 2019. Currently, the Air Force oversees most space warfare projects.The amendment has sent senior Pentagon leadership into a tizzy. Secretary of Defense James Mattis  strongly  urged Congress to rescind the requirement, stating in a letter that  it is premature to add additional organization and administrative tail to the department at a time I am trying to reduce overhead. Similarly, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson protested that the proposal will simply  add more boxes to the organization chart.  Meanwhile, Gen. John W. Raymond, commander of Air Force Space Command, insisted that his service has space matters well in hand. (He should be happy   the Pentagon recently raised his position to a 4-star rank.)Upping the AnteIn response, Rep. Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican and chairman of the Strategic Forces subcommittee, announced that he was  pissed  and  outraged  at the Air Force for fighting the new Space Command, saying its obstructionism would  set back efforts to respond to adversaries and space threats  and allow Russia and China  to surpass us soon. The Air Force leadership would have us trust them: I don t think so,  Rogers sneered, as if speaking about the Russians.  They just need a few more years to rearrange the deck chairs: I don t think so. This is the same Air Force that got us into the situation where the Russians and the Chinese are near-peers to us in space.  He vowed,  We will not allow the status quo to continue. Behind all the fiery argumentation lies a bipartisan consensus that the United States must sharply increase its spending on the militarization of space to maintain global supremacy. Gen. Raymond applauded Congress for recognizing the  national imperative  of his mission to  normalize, elevate, and integrate space as a war-fighting domain. Secretary Wilson published an op-ed column last month on her new initiatives to  develop space airmen who have the tools, training, and resources to fight when   not if   war extends into space.  She fully expects Congress to follow through on her request for a 20 percent increase in Air Force space funding. (Total military spending on space, including non-Air Force programs like the National Reconnaissance Office, came to about $22 billion last year.)What s driving all this activity   aside from baser motives of bureaucratic advantage and financial gain  are  intelligence assessments  that  China and Russia have aggressive programs to both demonstrate and produce eventual operational capability to . . . attack our space assets across the spectrum,  in the words of David Hardy, acting deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for Space. While we re not at war in space, I don t think we can say we re exactly at peace, either, said Navy Vice Adm. Charles A. Richard, deputy commander of U.S. Strategic Command, in March. Gen. John Hyten, head of the Pentagon s Strategic Command, recently declared that the United States needs not only a good defense, but  an offensive capability to challenge  space threats from Russia and China.The High Stakes in SpaceThe stakes are potentially huge because the United States uses space for all manner of command, control, and intelligence missions, not to mention civilian applications. Orbiting satellites provide near-real-time images of conflict zones, sense missile launches and nuclear tests, provide precise positioning coordinates to guide weapons systems, and route secure communications to remote regions of the globe Continue this story at Consortium NewsREAD MORE SPACE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Space FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",

        "text": "Donald Trump is a disease. The symptoms have always been with us. We ve always been a nation that s at least 1/3 completely bigoted a**holes, but this year, Donald Trump has given them permission to fester and spread their hate germs all over the nation.Instead of receiving a tip, a waitress in South Carolina received a note. You re right if you re thinking that never ends well. It didn t. In the note, the obvious Trump supporter told the waitress that she was a disgrace to womankind and a disgrace to her husband   because she worked.Thank you for your excellent service today   you re a good waitress.Here s your tip:The woman s place is in the home. Your place is in the home. It even says so in the Bible. You may think that you re contributing to your household by coming into work, but you re not. While you re in here  working  this is the reason your husband must see another woman on his way home from a long day at his work. Because you should be home taking care of the household duties, you may think what you are doing  working  is right, it is really essentially a disgrace to his manhood and to the American family. So instead of coming to your  job  and looking for handouts to feed your family, how s about going home and cleaning your house and cooking a hot meal for your husband and children, the way your husband and God intended, and help make America great again. Praying for families and our nation.Notice  make America great again?  Obviously, that was a reference to Donald Trump. And obviously, this person has no idea what Christianity is about.The waitress did respond that she  felt mortified, embarrassed, humiliated even. I felt hurt and a bit heartbroken.  She says she s not even married, but she does have a boyfriend who is supportive.Most waitresses don t work because they have nothing better to do. Most people don t work because they have nothing better to do. People, and waitresses are no exception, work because they need money to survive. Most families these days need two incomes, but conservatives don t want to do anything to help them. Instead, they destroy unions, drive down wages and take away benefits. I m not a religious person, but something makes me think Jesus wouldn t approve.h/t and featured image: Patheos |",

        "text": "Only supporters of Donald Trump could say something so stupid that a news anchor smacks their own head in frustration.When CNN host Alisyn Camerota organized a discussion with a bunch of Trump supporters, she apparently didn t expect the monumental stupidity she was about to receive.The group of Trump supporters, which included Susan DeLemus, Paula Johnson, and others whom Camerota has spoken to before throughout the 2016 Election, were totally ignorant of Trump s picks for his administration and repeatedly spouted falsehoods in order to defend him.DeLemus claimed that Trump only picked  top  people to fill his cabinet. People that I m looking at that Trump has appointed or nominated have all been top of the class, number one in their field, extremely talented, great leaders on their own,  she said.Of course, any reasonable person with a functioning brain understands that Trump has been scraping the bottom of the conservative barrel to fill government positions. After all, no one can say with a straight face that Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions is the best attorney in the country.And no one can say that Sarah Palin is even remotely qualified to be Secretary of anything, much less Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Trump s pick to run the Department of Education, Betsy DeVos, is staunchly anti-public schools and funds a group that wants to dismantle child labor laws because mining would be  exciting  for kids. In other words, she is definitely unqualified to shape the future of education in this country.But when the subject of protests against Trump came up, Camerota was flooded with idiocy spearheaded by Johnson. Voting is a privilege in this country and you need to be legal, not like California where three million illegals voted,  she claimed. Where are you getting your information?  a confused Camerota asked.Johnson claimed she got the information from the media, including CNN, which means Johnson probably took reports on Trump s tweet about 3 million people voting illegally for Hillary Clinton as the truth because the media reported on it.Johnson repeatedly insisted that California let 3 million undocumented immigrants vote and claimed that President Obama encouraged them to vote. All of the panelists agreed, with one even daring Camerota to  Google it  because it s on Facebook. Well, Camerota did and found that Fox Business deceptively edited a clip of President Obama to make it sound like he encouraged undocumented immigrants to vote when, in fact, he did not.But that didn t sway Johnson from continuing to insist that California allows undocumented immigrants to vote, which caused Camerota to smack her own head in frustration because the stupid was clearly strong in this one.Here s the video via YouTube.Seriously, Donald Trump claim about 3 million illegal voters has been thoroughly debunked and has been trashed by members of his own party because it is so absurd. This segment proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Trump supporters are completely ignorant and have been brainwashed to believe anything that Trump says. And yet they wonder why they are constantly mocked.Featured image via screenshot",

        "text": "We can t afford to give our US Veterans a proper funeral, but we ve got money to burn when it comes to bringing Muslim refugees to the US from countries who hate us. On average, each Middle Eastern refugee resettled in the United States costs an estimated $64,370 in the first five years, or $257,481 per household. When a veteran or member of the armed forces dies, he or she is entitled to a ceremony that includes the presentation of a U.S. flag to a family member and a bugler blowing Taps. Most of the time, there is a three-volley rifle salute if requested by family members. But now, if the deceased served in the Air Force, the three-volley salute is not an option because the Air Force can no longer support riflemen for funeral services for veteran retirees.Seven member services for retirees included six members to serve as pall-bearers, a six member flag-folding detail, and a three riflemen to fire the salute. Veteran s funerals now only receive the services of two-member teams, who provide a flag-folding ceremony, the playing of taps, and the presentation of the flag to the next of kin. To me, without the 21-gun salute, it just does not make it complete a proper military burial,  veteran Wayne Wakeman told Honolulu s KHON 2 News.  I think because of sequestration or the lack of funds or whatever excuse they re giving, that they had to hit the veterans. Wakeman is correct in supposing the cut is due to sequestration, the 2013 automatic federal spending cuts required by the Budget Control Act of 2011.Rose Richeson, from the Secretary of the Air Force s Public Affairs Press Desk, told We Are The Mighty the policy of restricting the funeral honor is an Air Force-wide requirement. The requirement is consistent with DoD policy which require a minimum of two personnel,  Richeson said.  Any number of personnel above two that is provided in support of military funeral honors is based on local resources available.  Via: FOX News",

        "text": "The Trump campaign is self destructing. If things get any worse between now and the election day, Trump could even be bringing down Congress. Republicans are in a panic and the only way out they see is voter suppression.Florida s Governor Rick Scott saw an opportunity when Hurricane Matthew hit. He refused to extend the registration deadline past 5:00 on Monday (seriously, why would the cutoff be a month before the election anyway?). A federal judge put a quick stop to that, calling it  irrational.  The deadline is extended till Tuesday. Quite simply, it is wholly irrational in this instance for Florida to refuse to extend the voter registration deadline when the state already allows the governor to suspend or move the election date due to an unforeseen emergency,  (U.S. District Judge Mark) Walker wrote in a 16-page order.  If aspiring eligible Florida voters are barred from registering to vote, then those voters are stripped of one of our most precious freedoms. Source: TampaBay.comMore than that, Walker called the state s effort to block the vote  unconstitutional. The right to vote is a  precious  and  fundamental  right,  Walker wrote, quoting from an earlier case.It s expected that about 100,000 additional people will be registering between now and the deadline. This is especially bad for Republicans. Clinton is leading the race in Florida by a narrow three points, but between his offensive remarks toward women and the fact that it was revealed that Trump illegally did business with Cuba, his Florida support is quickly fading. Without Florida, Trump is almost assured of losing, while Clinton could still win the election while losing Florida. Those 100,000 people might represent about one percent of the Florida electorate, which might not sound like a lot, but in a race that s that close, in a perennial swing state, that could mean the difference between winning and losing.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images.",

Obama used the dossier to spy on Trump!Anyone who followed the Obama White House intel policy outcomes will know that DNI Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan were the two primary political operatives weaponizing intelligence.But it gets better Comey comes into play:Remember the bombshell testimony of the Hermitage Capital CEO where the origin of the Fusion GPS  Russian Dossier  was discussed? CEO Browder stated the Russian government paid Fusion GPS to create the Steele propaganda dossier on candidate Donald Trump. That same dossier was used by the FBI in June/July 2016 to generate the FISA surveillance warrants against the Trump campaign. BOMBSHELL: Comey was using propaganda commissioned by Russia, funded in part by the FBI, to attack Trump, as the framework to launch his FBI investigation into candidate Donald Trump and Russian collusion.CEO BROWDER S ADMISSION BELOW:This is getting good.What does Nunes do now after several attempts at getting documents related to the dossier?After two previous deadlines came and went, House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes has set a new date for the FBI and Justice Department to turn over documents relating to the Trump dossier.Nunes originally subpoenaed the FBI and Justice on Aug. 24, demanding dossier documents by Sept. 1. When none were produced, Nunes agreed to extend the deadline to September 14. During that time, arrangements were made for intelligence committee investigators to visit the Justice Department to make sure officials on both sides understood precisely which documents the committee seeks.No documents were produced by Sept. 14, and now Nunes, apparently unsatisfied with the results of the staff meeting, has sent a new letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In it, Nunes set a deadline of this Friday for the documents to be produced. If the documents are not produced by then, Nunes directed that Wray and Sessions appear in an open committee hearing Sept. 28, to explain why they did not hand over the materials.The document request in the original Aug. 24 subpoena has not changed. It focuses on the FBI s relations with Christopher Steele, the former British spy retained by the American opposition research firm Fusion GPS to dig dirt on Donald Trump in Russia as part of an effort funded by wealthy supporters of Hillary Clinton. Among other things, the original subpoena demanded all internal FBI reports  incorporating, relying on, or referring to  information provided by Steele, his sources, or Fusion GPS.The original subpoena also asked for  any information, if it exists, provided by Mr. Steele as an informant/source (confidential or otherwise) or in any other capacity,  as well as any documents relating to whether the FBI paid or offered any benefits to Steele. The subpoena also asked for all documents relating to FBI and Justice  efforts to corroborate, validate, or evaluate  information provided by Steele.Finally, the original subpoena requested any court applications for surveillance that included any information provided by Steele, plus any court orders, if there were any, that were based in any part on Steele s information.So far, the FBI and Justice Department have not provided the information.

        "text": "Friday, Wikileaks released their first batch of Podesta s emails, which included excerpts from Clinton s Wall Street transcripts that reaffirmed why Clinton refused to release them in full. During the second presidential debate, Clinton confirmed their authenticity by attempting to defend one statement she made in the speech about having a public and private stance on political issues. She cited Abraham Lincoln, a defense comparable to her ridiculous invocation of 9/11 when pressed on her ties to Wall Street during a Democratic primary debate.The latest release reveals current DNC chair Donna Brazile, when working as a DNC vice chair, forwarded to the Clinton campaign a January 2016 email obtained from the Bernie Sanders campaign, released by Sarah Ford, Sanders  deputy national press secretary, announcing a Twitter storm from Sanders  African-American outreach team.  FYI  Brazile wrote to the Clinton staff.  Thank you for the heads up on this Donna,  replied Clinton campaign spokesperson Adrienne Elrod.The second batch of emails include more evidence of collusion between the mainstream media and Clinton Campaign.One email, received by prolific Clinton donor Haim Saban, was forwarded to Clinton staff, praising the friendly moderators in the early March 2016 Democratic primary debate co-hosted by Univision in Florida.  Haim, I just wanted to tell you that I thought the moderators for last nights Debate were excellent. They were thoughtful, tough and incisive. I thought it made Hilary appear direct and strong in her resolve. I felt it advanced our candidate. Thanks for Univision,  wrote Rob Friedman, former co-chair of the Motion Picture Group.Another email discusses planting a favorable Clinton story in The New York Times in March 2015.  NYT heroine. Should she call her today?  Podesta wrote to other Clinton campaign staffers with the subject line  Laura Donohoe.   I do think it s a great idea! We can make it happen,  replied Huma Abedin. The story they referred to is likely  In New Hampshire, Clinton Backers Buckle Up,  published in The New York Times on March 12, 2015 about Laura Donahoe, a retired nurse and Clinton supporter in New Hampshire.John Harwood, New York Times contributor and CNBC correspondent, regularly exchanged emails with Podesta communicating more as a Clinton surrogate than a journalist.In an October 2015 email thread, Clinton staff were in damage control over Hillary s support for the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as between a man and a woman. Hillary Clinton would not disavow her support for it.  I m not saying double down or ever say it again. I m just saying that she s not going to want to say she was wrong about that, given she and her husband believe it and have repeated it many times. Better to reiterate evolution, opposition to DOMA when court considered it, and forward looking stance. Former Clinton Foundation director, Darnell Strom of the Creative Artist Agency, wrote a condescending email to Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard after she resigned from the DNC to endorse Bernie Sanders, which he then forwarded to Clinton campaign staff.  For you to endorse a man who has spent almost 40 years in public office with very few accomplishments, doesn t fall in line with what we previously thought of you. Hillary Clinton will be our party s nominee and you standing on ceremony to support the sinking Bernie Sanders ship is disrespectful to Hillary Clinton,  wrote Strom.A memo sent from Clinton s general counsel, Marc Elias of the law firm Perkins Coie, outlined legal tricks to circumvent campaign finance laws to raise money in tandem with Super Pacs.Read more: The Observer",

First of all, it s pretty ironic that supposedly Obama plans to  Protect Muslims from people like Donald Trump who threaten their religious liberties . Who the HELL is threatening any Muslim s religious liberties? The irony in all this is that CHRISTIAN religious liberties are being threatened EVERY DAY around the world! Christian persecution is happening everywhere yet you hear NOTHING from this jackwagon of a president! Obama also says he will continue to bring Muslim refugees despite  the voices that seek to divide us ? What the heck is he talking about? Americans have welcomed and paid for over one million Muslim immigrants and refugees since 2001:Twelve years after the September 11th hijackers were invited into the country on temporary visas, the U.S. decided to admit 280,276 migrants from Muslim countries within a single fiscal year.To put these numbers into perspective, this means that every year the U.S. admits a number of Muslim migrants larger in size than the entire population of Des Moines, Iowa; Lincoln, Nebraska; or Dayton, Ohio.The rate of Muslim immigration has been increasing since September 11. Between 2001 and 2013, the United States permanently resettled 1.5 million Muslim immigrants throughout the United States. Unlike illegal immigrants, legal immigrants granted lifetime resettlement privileges will be given automatic work permits, welfare access, and the ability to become voting citizens. Via: BreitbartThis year, we ve  welcomed  over 1,000 refugees with ONLY TWO being Christian! ONLY TWO! Entire towns have been transformed into little Iraq with the call to prayer five times a day ringing in the ears of  welcoming  and tolerant Americans. We ve literally bent over backwards to bring in all these refugees at our own expense!Donald Trump was SO RIGHT when he called for a moratorium on Muslim refugees! This has nothing to do with anything other than PROTECTING OUR OWN PEOPLE! We have every right to do so!Please read the article below on Obama s message and you ll be sickened by his attitude and support of one community over all others:President Barack Obama had a message for Muslim Americans preparing to observe the beginning of Ramadan on Sunday: He ll protect them from people like Donald Trump who threaten their religious liberties.In an official statement, Obama said America would continue to welcome immigrants and refugees, despite  the voices that seek to divide us. Obama s official statement on the start of Ramadan, a monthlong holiday observed by Muslims through fasting during daylight hours, did not mention Trump by name, but the president s remarks clearly seemed to be a swipe at the presumptive GOP nominee.  I stand firmly with Muslim American communities in rejection of the voices that seek to divide us or limit our religious freedoms or civil rights,  the president said in the statement.  I stand committed to safeguarding the civil rights of all Americans no matter their religion or appearance. I stand in celebration of our common humanity and dedication to peace and justice for all.  Obama said he looks forward to hosting Muslims at the White House as the monthlong observation concludes in July. Trump on Sunday suggested that a Muslim judge may be biased against him in a Trump lawsuit because of his calls for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.Read more: POLITICO",

        "title": "ANDREW BREITBART Warned Us The Occupy Wall Street Movement Would Morph Into An Orchestrated Race War [VIDEO]",
        "text": " No One Listened We had many chances to expose this freak show when it started, but Americans allowed the Left to bully us into submission for fear of being labeled a  racist It s important to understand this  movement  comprised of domestic terrorists and their motives. Please read this story to the end.Here is Andrew Breitbart s warning to Americans just before he died:Why is Breitbart News so on top of the Black Lives Matter movement?Easy. We saw it coming.Not everyone liked what we saw either. In August 2012, the magazine American Conservative did an article on the film Occupy Unmasked. That film was directed by Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon and featured people like Andrew Breitbart, Brandon Darby, and myself exposing the Occupy Wall Street movement for what it was   a socialist, Obama-inspired activist movement. We pointed out that Occupy was the latest incarnation of the far-left, anti-American protest movements that dates back to the 1960s  Students for a Democratic Society and Black Panthers. We also said that the next step in the evolution of Occupy Wall Street would be race-based.Breitbart News has given #BlackLivesMatter more detailed, deep, and honest coverage than any other media outlet on the planet in 2015, and for good reason. From covering every major protest they did to exposing the cop killer that the group worships to revealing the secret funder behind the movement to Milo Yiannopoulos s complete shredding of activist Shaun King, Breitbart News has been the go-to source for original reporting on Black Lives Matter.American Conservative took the film to task for using the term  race war  to describe what we saw as the next phase of the Occupy movement. Remember, Occupy Unmasked came out about a year before three self-described queer black women started Black Lives Matter in July 2013. In 2012, Anita MonCrief was mocked by American Conservative when she defended her use of the term  race war  in Occupy Unmasked by saying:But seriously, that s why you have Barack Obama out there saying if he had a son, he would look like Trayvon Martin.   they want black people running around in hoodies protesting in the streets. That s what he s looking for.   He wants us divided, and he wants us to fight in the streets, so they can basically keep us down.MonCrief said this two years before the hoodie-wearing thugs burned down Ferguson, before they looted and set fire to Baltimore, before they shut down Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)16% at NetRoots nation, and before they shut down Chicago s  Magnificent Mile  on the busiest shopping day of the year.Anita Moncrief is an amazing patriot who doesn t get enough credit for exposing the truth about the Left. Watch her shocking testimony of how she became a conservative warrior here:The assertion that Occupy Wall Street would morph into Black Lives Matter wasn t a lucky guess. MonCrief, Darby, and I are all former leftists with professional organizational experience. Anita was a whistleblower who worked for ACORN, Darby was a cofounder of Common Ground in New Orleans, and I did work for MoveOn.org and Brave New Films. Because we understand the tactics and the players, it was clear to us that the Occupy movement and its focus on class had failed to resonate with a large enough segment of the American people. We knew that the logical next step was to head back to the 1960s  playbook of trying to tear down America by creating as deep a racial rift as possible.With Barack Obama in the White House and Eric Holder running the Department of Justice, the stage was set for the next iteration of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Black Lives Matter was the new Occupy.We also saw that community organizers were working on developing a new movement based on young black people in the wake of George Zimmerman s not guilty verdict in the Trayvon Martin shooting case. As I wrote at Breitbart News in July 2013, the takeover of the Florida statehouse by the group Dream Defenders was a  magnet for young people. The long-term goal is straightforward and explicit: the 2014 vote. Once in the Capitol, the Dream Defenders are giving the enthusiastic participants organizer training, right in the governor s office. With two generations of educators, media, and legal experts all schooled in New Left political correctness by America s leading universities, the Black Lives Matter movement has been essentially immune to criticism. The result has left universities, businesses, and police departments defenseless   intellectually and physically   against Black Lives Matter.There s been a practical cost as well. We ve seen businesses burned to the ground in Ferguson and Baltimore. We ve seen other businesses shut down at the Mall of America and on Chicago s  Magnificent Mile.  We ve seen the murder rate spike in cities across the country as a result of the  Ferguson Effect  that has caused police officers to pull back from enforcing the law in the face of unrelenting hostility and scrutiny.We ve seen universities from coast-to-coast bullied into staff firings and policy changes that were meant to only aid black students. These college uprisings have been accompanied by a fierce hatred of free speech; and when combined with the bold aggressiveness of multicultural and feminist Social Justice Warriors, they ve created an educational environment that is openly hostile to white students and faculty.With the next presidential election only 11 months away, conservatives and Republicans would be making a huge mistake to ignore the Black Lives Matter movement.At the close of 2015, the pot is getting ready to boil over. The decision not to prosecute Cleveland police officers in the shooting death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, the ongoing anger in Minneapolis over the death of Jamar Clark, and two recent Chicago police shootings all create an atmosphere where even angier protests are in the works.Already, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his Democrat machine regard Black Lives Matter activists as an existential threat.The engine that drives the anger is the mainstream media, which has done nothing to seriously vet the Black Lives Matter movement. Much of the anger is caused by the inaccurate reporting that consistently vilifies the police and leaves out key details about the shooting victims. This has led to fables such as  Hands Up, Don t Shoot,  which have continued to be amplified and repeated by Black Lives Matter protesters long after they have been debunked.In fact, one of the key characteristics of the Black Lives Matter movement and the mainstream media s reporting on it is a naked antipathy for facts. Both in real life and on social media like Twitter, leading Black Lives Matter activists are known for shutting down the speech of dissenting opinions and literally blocking anyone who disagrees with them.The result has been a hermetically sealed activist movement that is angry and ignorant, with a hairtrigger temper and a long list of grievances that have no factual basis. Worse, their set of crazed demands have been granted time and again by officials who are too scared to speak out for fear of being branded racists.Like spoiled children, none of this appeasement has done anything to quell the protesters  fury. Every time that politicians or university administrators have given into the outrageous, entitled Black Lives Matter mob, they ve learned that feeding that monster has only given it more power to make more demands.In the face of all this feckless kowtowing, no wonder the blunt and in-your-face style of billionaire Donald Trump has hit home for so many Americans. Trump   like Ronald Reagan in the 1960s   seems to be one of the few people in public life willing to tell Black Lives Matter protesters to sit down, shut up, and stop taking the loser road of self-victimization.This is one of the reasons that Donald Trump, more than any other political candidate on the scene right now, has incurred so much of the wrath and anger of Black Lives Matter. They are keenly aware that he simply will not play their game. The other current frontrunner for the Republican nomination is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)97% , who has already demonstrated that he is no cupcake either. Should either Cruz or Trump be the nominee, expect Black Lives Matter s army to take to the streets and try to shut them down at every opportunity.For that reason, the current political season is set to be even more divisive than either of the last two election cycles, which had already set a very high bar for vitriol.As the newest incarnation of the activist Left, Black Lives Matter will not back down or rest until it is either stopped by somone gutsy enough to call them out or until it gets what it wants: a bloody revolution leading to a socialist/anarchist America.The one thing the left has not counted on, however, is a dogged, active conservative media culture that can bring real information straight to the American people without being filtered by Black Lives Matter s journalism school comrades. We re not about to let Black Lives Matter or any leftist revolutionary movement destroy America without making sure they re fully revealed for what they are. Via: Breitbart News",

        "text": "Modern day culture is far from what it used to be. Technology has taken over human contact and conversation, and people are seemingly forgetting what it s like the actually speak with a person who is directly in front of them. This forgetfulness can also be seen in the depths of Twitter as trolls seem to feel they can say anything to anyone at any time with no remorse for their actions or words because there is no human face attached to who they are attacking.A great example of this lack of human interaction experience occurred after Jennifer Lawrence won her Golden Globe for her performance in Joy. In what some people are calling rude, the actress was just being brutally honest and some people forget what it s like to point something out to someone s face. In actuality, the person who was being rude was a particular reporter who was asking Lawrence a question surrounding her win.The reporter begins to ask Lawrence a question, but the Oscar winner quickly cuts him off and says: You can t live your whole life behind your phone, bro  You can t do that. You ve got to live in the now. You know? The reporter continuing on, mentioned the Oscars, so Lawrence, being the quit-witted person that she is, drove home her point: We re at the Golden Globes. If you put your phone down, you d know that. Now, to the people calling Lawrence rude   Really? She was clearly giving that reporter her undivided attention and was making herself available to answer his question, and he was still staring at his phone. So, who was rude? It certainly wasn t Lawrence for pointing it out.If you go back and watch the Golden Globes during the part when Amy Schumer and Jennifer Lawrence were announcing each other s films, you can see that there was a jab at people using their phones then, too.We ve become a culture all too reliant on our cell phones and technology that we ve forgotten basic human interaction skills, better known as social skills. Don t call someone rude for pointing out rude behavior. Take what they are saying to heart, understand why it may offend you, because you may be just as guilty, and remember that human beings should, in fact, have human interaction without technology getting in the way.Lawrence perfectly points out what s wrong with modern-day life, and kudos to her for doing so. We all need to live in the now. Life is happening before our very eyes if we make the decision to look up from our mobile devices.

        "title": " Cenk Uygur Rages At White Apathy After CPD Murders Black Teen (VIDEO)",
        "text": "On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook",

        "text": "The anti-establishment tide is rolling across Europe. You really can t blame the citizens for being furious at their leaders for allowing the invasion of Muslim immigrants into their hometowns and major cities. If this sentiment catches fire in America this summer, it will not likely bode well for Crooked Hillary at the polls in November, given that Trump is the ultimate non-establishment politician History professor Gudni Johannesson won Iceland s presidential election after riding a wave of anti-establishment sentiment, final results showed Sunday, although the vote was eclipsed by the country s eagerly-anticipated Euro football match.The political newcomer, who won with 39.1 percent of votes, was trailed by businesswoman Halla Tomasdottir, also without party affiliation, who took 29.4 percent, according to results announced on public television channel RUV.Johannesson only decided to run for the presidency after the so-called Panama Papers leak in April which detailed offshore accounts and implicated several senior Icelandic politicians, including the prime minister who was forced to resign.Throughout the campaign, Johannesson emphasised his non-partisan vision of the presidency, and vowed to restore faith in the political system after years of public anger toward politicians over scandals and financial woes.The victory was especially sweet for the history professor and political commentator, who has never held public office and has no party affiliation, as he celebrated his 48th birthday Sunday.David Oddsson, a former conservative prime minister who had been Johannesson s closest rival throughout most of the campaign, garnered just 13 percent of votes. The representative of the old era  has been rejected, people are looking to the future,  University of Akureyri political science professor Gretar Eythorsson told AFP.The president in Iceland holds a largely ceremonial position. More important legislative elections are due in the autumn.But the outrage that fuelled mass street protests in April and led to ousting of premier Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson appeared to have dissipated somewhat as euphoria erupted over the Icelandic football squad achieving a historic feat in the Euro 2016 football tournament.A North Atlantic island of just 334,000 people, Iceland beat Austria 2-1 on Wednesday to qualify for the last 16 in its first major international competition, and will face off against England on Monday.Britain s vote to leave the European Union also headlined the news on the eve of the election in Iceland, which itself had applied for EU membership in 2009 after suffering a devastating financial crisis in 2008, but abandoned the bid six years later.Like most of Iceland s voters, Johannesson is opposed to EU membership.

He suggested that they deserved to have higher premiums because having a preexisting condition is like getting into a car accident.While discussing the Republican health care bill with Meet the Press host Chuck Todd, Johnson thinks that he knows the answer to why insurance companies are abandoning certain markets, but that  nobody wants to talk about it. The Republican from Wisconsin suggested the reason was the Obamacare rules that protected Americans from preexisting conditions, rather than market instability creating by Republicans. We know why those premiums doubled. We ve done something with our health care system that you would never think about doing, for example, with auto insurance, where you would require auto insurance companies to sell a policy to somebody after they crash their car. States that have  guarantees for preexisting conditions, it crashes their markets,  he continued.  It causes the markets to collapse. It causes premiums to skyrocket.

        "text": "The Republican Party is trying its hardest to gloss over the fact that its new health care replacement is a disaster that is going to hurt the American people more than anything.At a time when it s been widely reported that Americans are overwhelmingly satisfied with their Obamacare and would like to keep it, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) went on CNN in an attempt to promote Trumpcare. Unfortunately, he didn t anticipate being taken to the woodshed by host Chris Cuomo.Cuomo pushed back on Jordan s agenda and absolutely refused to let him get away with praising the new Republican health care plan without acknowledging the fact that literally MILLIONS of Americans will lose their health insurance thanks to Trump and the GOP. Cuomo also railed against Jordan s vision, stating that a  free market  for health insurance has never been executed anywhere else in the world, because all other developed countries make sure their citizens have health coverage. Cuomo said: You use government as if it s a bad word in this context, but to be fair, there is no place that you ll find that has this kind of marketplace when it comes to health insurance. You re saying it like it s something that should be understood. It s never existed anywhere else that you can point to, and remember, you have to be okay with having less people having health insurance to get some people to have it cheaper. Jordan tried to say that he wanted all people to have better insurance,  but Cuomo saw right through his bullsh*t and promptly called him out: They will lose coverage. The way you re fixing it right now millions of people may lose their coverage, you need to own that. Jordan could barely come up with a response to that other than a pathetic promise that those who got their health coverage through Obamacare would eventually be transitioned into the new system.You can watch Cuomo rip Jordan apart below:Featured image is a screenshot",

        "title": " Hilarious Rare Video Shows How Hillary Prepared To Avoid A Trump Hug",
        "text": "By now, we re all aware of how Donald Trump repeatedly humiliates the nation with his handshake games. He awkwardly tugs people in some kind of attempted power play, holds on to their hands for far too long, and, in the most inhospitable move of all, attempts to give them unwanted hugs.Well, during the 2016 presidential campaign, it appears that Hillary Clinton s team had observed this bizarre behavior, and made sure that when she met Trump for debates, Hillary was ready to avoid the gross awkwardness of an unwanted Trump hug in front of millions of debate viewers.On Friday, longtime Clinton aide Phillip Reines released a rare clip from debate prep, in which he played Donald Trump. In the clip, Reines as Trump attempts to hug Hillary, and she runs away from him.While funny, it really does show just how bizarre Trump s behavior is, and it speaks to a larger issue with his mental state. Anyone who acts like that with people they are opposing politically, or worse, meeting for the purpose of diplomacy, has serious issues.We re not the only ones who think so, either. Just Google the videos of Trump s Oval Office meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, or any other world leader Trump has behaved this way with. They all look either disgusted, alarmed, horrified, insulted, or some combination thereof. And of course, we can t leave out the reports that now-former FBI Director James Comey was, quote,  disgusted  with the forced half-hug Trump gave him for the cameras.Oh well, at least we get this bit of Hillary humor while we witness and live through what is easily the craziest, most bizarre presidency in the history of this great nation.Watch the video below:Not easy to avoid the unwanted Trump hug, sometimes it even takes practice A favorite moment from debate prep (9/24/16): pic.twitter.com/JAAHaqKFoa  Philippe Reines (@PhilippeReines) May 19, 2017Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",

        "text": "Leaked text messages between the daughters of Paul Manafort, who served as Donald Trump s campaign manager until his Russian ties came back to bite him in the rear, reveal that they believe their father committed mass murder in the Ukraine.Manafort has conceded that his daughter s phones were hacked and roughly 300,000 messages were leaked. There is no way to describe the conversations between Andrea and Jessica other than downright chilling. Don t fool yourself,  Andrea wrote to her sister, according to Business Insider.  That money we have is blood money. You know he has killed people in Ukraine? Knowingly,  she continued.  As a tactic to outrage the world and get focus on Ukraine. Remember when there were all those deaths taking place. A while back. About a year ago. Revolts and what not. Do you know whose strategy that was to cause that, to send those people out and get them slaughtered. In later messages between Andrea and her cousin, Collin Bond, she also revealed that Manafort s marriage was in trouble, but a  public divorce  was not an option because Manafort had  too many skeletons  and  his work and payment in Ukraine is legally questionable. He is a sick f ing tyrant,  Andrea said to Bond regarding her father.  And we keep showing up and dancing for him.   We just keep showing up and eating the lobster. Nothing changes. In their texts, his daughters also discussed Manafort s relationship with Donald Trump. Politico reports:In one exchange, daughter Jessica Manafort writes  Im not a trump supporter but i am still proud of dad tho. He is the best at what he does.  Her sister Andrea Manafort responded by referring to their father s relationship with Trump as  The most dangerous friendship in America,  while in another exchange she called them  a perfect pair  of  power-hungry egomaniacs,  and asserted  the only reason my dad is doing this campaign is for sport. He likes the challenge. It s like an egomaniac s chess game. There s no money motivation. Manafort has a long history of working for murderous dictators with zero f*cks to give about those who suffer the ultimate consequences. Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Ukraine s Viktor Yanukovych, and Zaire s Mobutu Sese Seko are all on Manafort s resume. And apparently, his family is completely aware of who this man really is   and so is Trump.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",

Mike Conaway, whose own views on the Russia situation are, well, let s just say they would make Putin happy.When FBI Director James Comey testified last month, Conaway unleashed a weird defense of Putin, comparing his support of Donald Trump   which has been verified by 17 intelligence agencies   to football of all things. That might work on Saturday afternoon when my wife s (Texas Tech) Red Raiders are playing the Texas Longhorns,  Conaway said.  She really like the Red Raiders.

Those are foreign actors, foreign people, influencing the vote in Nevada. You don t hear the Democrats screaming and saying one word about that. Asked whether that is the same as Russia interfering in our election, Conaway didn t back down: Sure it is, it s foreign influence. If we re worried about foreign influence, let s have the whole story. Assisting Conaway will be Trey Gowdy, who recently found himself the subject of an ethics complaint for accepting donations from anti-Clinton groups while he was investigating her and Tom Rooney, who very vocally opposed Clinton.Something tells me these guys won t be taking this seriously.Featured image via Getty Images (Mark Wilson)/screengrab",

        "text": "Hecklers at GOP rallies rarely disappoint   after all, the Republican presidential candidates have given them so much material to be inspired by. On Sunday, at one of his last rallies before the Iowa caucus, Ted Cruz had an experience with a heckler he probably won t ever forget.As Cruz gave his stump speech, an audience member shouted that he didn t feel so well while pretending to vomit in a trash can, stating that his illness was because  Ted Cruz looks so weird!  This brave heckler wasn t far from Cruz and he repeated it loud and clear just in case the candidate missed it the first time. Scott Bauer, a reporter for the Associated Press, fortunately captured part of this hilarious interruption on video and tweeted it for all to see:.@tedcruz enters Des Moines rally pic.twitter.com/06Itp606hN  Scott Bauer (@sbauerAP) February 1, 2016Of course, security removed the heckler out of the rally almost immediately and Cruz said,  I guess the bars let out early.  On social media, some people in the audience expressed sadness that the heckler was taken away, as the rally certainly could have used him.twitterCruz then used the moment to take a jab at one of his rivals and joked, Is that Donald Trump yelling in the back?  The joke was completely appropriate, considering that Trump and Cruz are competing with each other for the Iowa Caucuses later tonight.It was actually reported by the Associated Press that the heckler was in fact ill   so perhaps it was really Cruz s creepy appearance that set the protester off. It would make perfect sense, considering the unpleasant, cringeworthy effect that Cruz s face had on his own daughter! To top off Cruz s disastrous, rejection-filled weekend, his tour bus got stuck in the mud in Iowa and he had to hitch a ride with his aides.We ve seen some pretty creative hecklers during the GOP candidate s campaigns so far, and Cruz has had more than his fair share. Earlier this month, two hecklers actually made it onto Cruz s stage at a gun event, making for a completely awkward moment.

And well, let s just say that it didn t go very well for him.Schilling finds himself completely baffled by Jews and just can t figure out why they vote for Democrats. So he decided to ask Jake Tapper because he s a Jewish guy. In hindsight, he will hopefully realize what an ass he made out of himself in the process. I would like to ask you something as a person who is practicing the Jewish faith and has since you were young,  Schilling began. I don t understand  and this is, maybe this is the amateur, non-politician in me  I don t understand how people of Jewish faith can back the Democratic Party, which over the last 50 years has been so clearly anti-Israel, so clearly anti-Jewish Israel,  Schilling charged. I don t know what else would need to be done, said or happen for people to understand that they don t  the Democratic Party is alive for Israel only because we have agreements in place to make them have to be. Tapper, obviously trying to hold it together after such an appalling remark, responded, Well, I don t speak for Jews   and I don t support the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. I would imagine   just to try to answer your question   that one of the reasons many Jews are Democrats has more to do with Democrat support for social welfare programs and that sort of thing than it does for Israel,  said Tapper. And I know that a lot of Jews that are very strong supporters of Israel do support the Republican Party,  he continued,  but   again, I don t speak for Jews. Well, if there was any doubt that Warren would be able to beat Schilling in the upcoming election, there shouldn t be anymore.

And his latest Twitter rant is proof.In a string of tweets on Sunday morning, Donald Trump simultaneously promised to give businesses massive tax cuts and threatened to tax them if they leave the United States.The U.S. is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country,  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016Here s the thing. Trump literally just stated that he will  substantially  reduce taxes on businesses, which is basically the plan Kansas Republicans put in place and their state budget is now a disaster. Trump also intends to do away with regulations, which basically gives business owners the ability to do whatever the hell they want, which will be especially dangerous if the regulations Trump is talking about are safety regulations, food quality, etc Big businesses will be especially happy about this because they already pay little in taxes anyway.But then Trump threatens to punish businesses with a 35 percent tax if they move operations overseas.This doesn t make a lot of sense and businesses are probably laughing their asses off right now. Trump is already giving them a massive tax cut and less regulations, which means taxing them 35 percent isn t going to be much of a punishment at all.In fact, Trump s recent Carrier deal is the perfect example of how corporations will treat Trump s threats. Despite claiming that he saved jobs, Trump s so-called deal with Carrier cost taxpayers $7 million. Carrier gets that money and they STILL sent more jobs to Mexico than they kept in Indiana and then announced that they are closing another factory. Basically, Carrier took the money and moved jobs overseas anyway, which is exactly what other businesses are going to do because Trump doesn t know what the hell he is doing.Donald Trump is the idiot big businesses have been waiting for. Not only will corporations get to still move jobs overseas at a higher rate than ever before, they ll be able to fleece taxpayers for every cent they can get with Trump s willing assistance. Then they can move operations overseas anyway and use taxpayer money to pay Trump s 35 percent tax penalty.In other words, American workers and taxpayers better get ready because they are about to be screwed while CEOs laugh all the way to their offshore bank.Featured Image: Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images",

Many Republicans in the Senate condemned the personal attack on Mika Brzezinski and attacking on her looks. You have Lindsey Graham saying it was  beneath the office.  Ben Sasse,  This isn t normal.  Jeff Flake,  Beneath the dignity of the presidency.  Susan Collins begging,  This has to stop.  Lisa Murkowski begging,  This has to stop.  Does his behavior bother you? HHS Sec Tom Price wasn t about to go there and handled the uncomfortable situation beautifully:  Well, what I m concentrated on is the job that he s given me. And that is to make certain that we fulfill the mission of the Department of Health and Human Services, which is to improve the health, safety, and well-being of the American people. And there are a whole array of activities that we re undertaking. One of them is this piece of legislation that s in the Senate right now. But my job is consumed by making certain that we fulfill the mission at the department. Todd follows up with this rude question:  I m just asking you as a father. If your son tweeted about a woman like that, what would you say to him? Price fired back:  Chuck, you know, this is really remarkable. You ve got incredible challenges across this nation, incredible challenges around the world. The challenge that I ve been given is to address the health care issues. And your program, a program with the incredible history of Meet the Press, and that s what you want to talk about? Let me suggest to you that the American people want to talk about the challenges. Chuck Todd then tried to twist and spin his way out of the corner he just painted himself into:  Mr. Secretary, with all due respect, you re blaming me for what the president of the United States has spent his entire week focused on? HAHA! CHUCK TODD STEPS IN IT WITH THAT COMMENT PRICE BURIES HIM WITH THIS LAST COMMENT: No, listen to me, with all due respect. The American people are concerned about a health care system that is not providing choices, where premiums are going up, where insurance companies are vacating markets all across this land. And that s what they want us to concentrate on. And that s what they want us to fix. And that s what I and the president are working on. BOOM! ",

Khan, was one of 14 American Muslims who have died while serving the United States military since 9/11.Standing next to his wife, Mr. Khan laid into Trump for arguing for a wall between America and Mexico, pointing out,  We cannot solve our problems by building walls We are stronger together. Pointing out Trump s incendiary anti-Muslim rhetoric, the father asked,  Let me ask [Trump], have you even read the United States Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy! He then dramatically reached into his jacket and pulled out his Constitution.Concluding his speech, Khan gave a full-throated endorsement of Hillary Clinton:  Vote for the healer not the divider.

A car approached the gates of the base he was tasked with protecting. As soldiers under Khan s command prepared to inspect the vehicle, his father told us, Captain Khan screamed for his men to  hit the dirt  and walked towards it himself and demanded the driver stop. Inside the car were two suicide bombers and a large amount of explosives. As the car reached the gate, the bomb was detonated, killing Khan and wounding 10 U.S. soldiers. His father believes many more men might have died without Khan s warning. Khan was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, two of the military s highest honors.The divisive nature of Trump s repeated attacks on Muslims has prompted the Khans to speak out against his candidacy for the presidency, and it resulted in an epic moment at the convention.Featured image via YouTube",

If you had any doubt Trump is being sabotaged by the main stream media and Washington old guards, look no further Coverage of President Trump is 93% negative! This is over the top! Our media and politicians are doing everything they can to destroy Trump How negative was press coverage of President Trump s first 100 days in office? Far more than that of Barack Obama, George W. Bush, or Bill Clinton, according to a new report from the Harvard Kennedy School s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.The Harvard scholars analyzed the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and the main newscasts (not talk shows) of CBS, CNN, Fox and NBC during Trump s initial time in office. They found, to no one s surprise, that Trump absolutely dominated news coverage in the first 100 days. And then they found that news coverage was solidly negative   80 percent negative among those outlets studied, versus 20 percent positive.The numbers for previous presidents: Barack Obama, 41 percent negative, 59 percent positive; George W. Bush, 57 percent negative, 43 percent positive; and Bill Clinton, 60 percent negative, 40 percent positive.Accusations of bias aside, it s simply a fact that a number of negative things happened in Trump s opening 100 days. The Russia investigation, for example, was a source of endless criticism from Democrats and other Trump opponents. The travel ban executive order led to intense argument and losses for the administration in the courts. The healthcare debacle created more negative coverage because it was a major screwup and a setback for both Trump and House Republicans.That said, the coverage of some news organizations was so negative, according to the Harvard study, that it seems hard to argue that the coverage was anywhere near a neutral presentation of facts. Assessing the tone of news coverage, the Harvard researchers found that CNN s Trump coverage was 93 percent negative, and seven percent positive. The researchers found the same numbers for NBC.Obama and Hillary s hero had this to say about taking down an enemy:Obama Campaign Manager and Senior Adviser had this to say about Trump last June: IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY BEAT TRUMP.

In 1978, he was given $1 million by his father, an amount that Trump called a  small loan  moments after he claimed that life  hasn t been easy for me  during a town hall event in October 2015.Of course, that s an insult to the millions of Americans who live in poverty daily and can t even get a real small loan to lift themselves out of it. They struggle to put food on the table and to pay the bills, but Donald Trump had everything he could ever want and all the opportunities money could buy. Trump s dad also started a million dollar trust fund for him and left him a multi-million dollar inheritance when he died. In other words, Donald Trump knows absolutely NOTHING about starting from nothing.But Eric Trump didn t address Roginsky s reminder and just continued trying to sell his dad as a man who pulled himself up by his bootstraps. He epitomized what America s all about: Opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams and what you want to succeed, right?  Eric Trump continued.  It s no different than a Zuckerberg, right, who went out with a great idea like a Facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it and grew it. That is achieving something, right? And I think it s very different than a person who has been a career politician. Here s the video via VidMe.Can no member of Trump s family actually refrain from lying about their past?Because it s clear that Donald Trump and his children do not understand what it is like to grow up poor. They have had everything given to them on a golden platter and they ve never had to work a real job a day in their lives. But for some reason, they think $1 million is the definition of starting with nothing.Featured image via screen capture",

        "text": "Donald Trump s nominee for a federal judgeship in Texas sounds like Michele Bachmann in his defense of conversion therapy, a discredited and dangerous practice. That practice, which claims to change a person s sexual orientation or gender identity or expression, has been rejected by every mainstream medical and mental health organization for decades. So naturally, Donald Trump s judicial pick, Jeff Mateer, the current first assistant attorney general of Texas, thinks it s a swell idea.At the time Mateer was serving as general counsel of the First Liberty Institute (have you noticed the  liberty  never means what they think it means?), he faced criticism from LGBT rights groups.Flashback: As the GOP nominee, Donald Trump said,  As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me. And then he chose a bigot as his vice-president and now a judicial nominee with his head up his a**.If Mateer is confirmed by the US Senate, he will serve on the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.CNN reports:In a May 2015 speech, titled  The Church and Homosexuality,  Mateer discussed a Colorado lawsuit in which the parents of a transgender girl sued her school for preventing her from using the bathroom of her choice. In Colorado, a public school has been sued because a first grader and I forget the sex, she s a girl who thinks she s a boy or a boy who thinks she s a girl, it s probably that, a boy who thinks she s a girl,  Mateer said in a video posted on Vimeo in 2015 And the school said,  Well, she s not using the girl s restroom.  And so she has now sued to have a right to go in. Now, I submit to you, a parent of three children who are now young adults, a first grader really knows what their sexual identity?  he said.  I mean it just really shows you how Satan s plan is working and the destruction that s going on. Trump, however, said in April that people should  use the bathroom they feel is appropriate.  Apparently, that s all changed now as he picks staunch and extreme conservatives to fill his administration and now, judicial posts.In that same May 2015 speech, Mateer said that the Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex marriage could lead to what he called  disgusting  new forms of matrimony. I submit to you that there ll be no line there,  he said.  Why couldn t four 4 people wanna get married? Why not one man and three women? Or three women and one man? I mean, it s disgusting. I ve learned words I didn t know. I mean, other than my assistants here, have you ever heard the word  throuple ?  Throuple  so that s three people coming together of different sexes, maybe mixed sexes,  he continued as if he couldn t stop himself.  Them coming together. There are people who marry themselves. Somebody wanted to marry a tree. People marrying their pets. It s just like   you know, you read the New Testament and you read about all the things and you think,  Oh, that s not going on in our community.  Oh yes, it is. We re back to that time where debauchery rules. Later that year in November 2015, Mateer blasted states for banning gay conversion therapy at a conference hosted by controversial pastor Kevin Swanson, who preaches that the Biblical punishment for homosexuality is death. Swanson has called for executing gays and he did that at an event packed with GOP candidates. The issue is always, it s same sex,  Mateer said, according to CNN.  And if you re giving conversion therapy, that s been outlawed in at least two states and then in some local areas. So they re invading that area. Image via screen capture. ",

        "text": "The Kuwaiti Embassy in Washington, D.C., tends to book their annual National Day celebration at the Four Seasons, and this year was supposed to be no exception. However, now this year is an exception because they ve moved it from the Four Seasons to Trump s hotel in the Old Post Office building. And they didn t do that on a lark.A diplomatic source, who wasn t authorized to speak publicly and therefore wasn t named, told ThinkProgress that the decision was political. The Trump Organization reportedly contacted the Ambassador of Kuwait and put pressure on him to move the event. They may have done the same to Bahrain earlier this month.Apparently, there are a lot of foreign governments who are thinking of taking their business to Trump s hotel as a way to curry favor with him. And Trump himself seems to be refusing to completely divest himself of his businesses. Could this be why? Surely an upstanding citizen such as Trump would never use his position as president to continue enriching himself. Right? Right.Har de har har.Trump s greed, along with the hotel s slow start, give him an incentive to continue being totally unethical. About a month after the hotel opened, there were many travel agents and event planners who felt the place wasn t worth the trouble it takes to plan events at fancy hotels. At the time, Trump s name and brand were badly tarnished, and that was reflected in the business at the hotel (and elsewhere, too).This might be a different story if Trump was sincere in his promise to divest, and focus on the issues facing America. Sure, he s open to  limits  on his involvement, but he doesn t want anyone outside his family to have rights to his name, and he wants to be able to return to his company once his term as president is over.There s no way for this to look good as long as Trump even appears to still be involved with his businesses. There s no way for it not to look like he s trading favors for money. It won t stop with Kuwait and Bahrain.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",

Hayden said: If someone else had said that outside the hall, he d be in the back of a police wagon now with the Secret Service questioning him.

        "text": "Many people will assume those who are religious will automatically vote Republican. That may be true with Evangelicals and Protestants, but that s not the case with Catholics, Jews and Muslims.But there is one religious group that is stuck between a rock and a hard place: Mormons.It s no secret Mormon voters (especially in Utah) hate Donald Trump. He s arrogant, vulgar, an adulterer, a liar and a sneak. And he openly exults it with little to no shame.The New York Times found that Trump does in fact have a  Mormon  problem, with only 33 percent having a favorable view of the Republican candidate. In the Utah Republican primary, Trump finished dead last with only 14 percent of the vote (Ted Cruz won).When it comes to Hillary Clinton, Mormons often give the same response   the cold shoulder   but not with the same vitriol as shown to Trump.That s why Clinton is seizing the opportunity and appealing to weary voters in Utah and aboard, hoping to solidify a coalition of traditional religious, Republican voters.In an op-ed featured in a newspaper owned by the Mormon Church, Clinton makes that appeal head on, writing:I ve been fighting to defend religious freedom for years. As secretary of state, I made it a cornerstone of our foreign policy to protect the rights of religious minorities around the world   from Coptic Christians in Egypt to Buddhists in Tibet. And along with Jon Huntsman, our then-ambassador in Beijing, I stood in solidarity with Chinese Christians facing persecution from their government.We stood up for these oppressed communities because Americans know that democracy ceases to exist when a leader or ruling faction can impose a particular faith on everyone else.Clinton drew parallels between Mormons, who were once profiled and discriminated against, and Trump s call to ban Muslims from entering the United States:Everyday Trump continues to prove he lacks the morals to be our commander in chief. With a new and outrageous headline seeming to pop up every day, it s easy to forget that Trump showed us his true colors early on, when he proposed banning all Muslims from our shores. That would undue centuries of American tradition and values. When it comes to religion, we strive to be accepting of everyone around us. That s because we need each other.The editor of the newspaper shed some hopeful light on the prospect of a Clinton win for Utah, stressing that the Republican, Mormon voter base has a  libertarian streak  when it comes to the issue of immigration, which affects the southwest more than any other region in the United States. Sensing that immigrants make communities stronger, Mormons tend to be more sympathetic to their plights. And the newspaper also noted that Mormon voters are  very sensitive  to religious persecution, which Trump has successfully made a crux in his campaign.The last Democrat to win Utah was Lyndon Johnson in 1964.

        "text": "According to a new report from a combined 13 federal agencies, not yet made public, even if the entire world stopped emitting greenhouse gases right this instant, we would still feel half a degree warmer on average over the next hundred years from the average today.That s the primary conclusion of the report, obtained by the New York Times, that is sitting in limbo awaiting Trump s approval for release. One contributor to the findings, speaking anonymously, said that he and many of the scientists involved in its production are concerned that the Trump administration will suppress it.That would be no surprise: Donald Trump made it a cornerstone of his candidacy   and a primary point of his presidency   to deny the effects of global warming. But this report, should it ever see the light of day, confirms much of what scientists have been saying, despite Trump s denials.Among the key findings:Unfortunately, one of the people who must sign off on this report before it is released as a public finding is Scott Pruitt, Donald Trump s appointee to the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt has stated on far too many occasions that he absolutely does not believe that carbon dioxide emissions are a primary contributor to global warming. Although it explains his position, the irony is that Pruitt has no scientific background whatsoever. If he did, he couldn t possibly disagree with this basic scientific fact   regardless of your political position on climate change, CO  absolutely warms any environment it s found in.Knowing what we do now about the government censoring climate change data in other agencies, it feels like too much to expect this report to come out, or at least unredacted. But at least we have the leaks from our reliable press to keep us in the loop.Read more:Featured image via Lukas Schulze/Getty Images",

        "text": "Kellyanne Conway whined about the media again and Chuck Todd smacked her down.Donald Trump has serious conflicts of interest that he should have to resolve before he is allowed to set one foot in the White House.It s pretty clear that Trump intends to intermingle his business with politics over the next four years and that s a major problem the country does not need.That s why the Wall Street Journal is calling for him to liquidate his assets and focus entirely on running the country. Because running it part-time just simply won t do.But Kellyanne Conway, Trump s former campaign manager who must have problems looking at herself in the mirror every morning knowing that she sold her fucking soul to help install a dictator into the highest office in the land, complained on Meet The Press on Sunday morning that doing so would rob Trump s kids of controlling the business.Of course, that s bullshit. We all know that Trump s kids get their marching orders from their daddy. And the fact that Ivanka Trump has been sitting in on meetings with foreign leaders makes it clear that the conflict of interest will continue to exist even if Trump hands the company over to them.Conway argued that Trump has already put the country first by running for president and winning. And then she started to attack the media for not treating Donald Trump like a cool guy we can all trust. You know, Chuck, he has put the country ahead of everything else just by running and, indeed, winning and becoming president of the United States. I went and looked back at what all the press clips and conversations on shows like this were eight years ago, it was basically just debating on how cool Barack Obama is. So, we should at least   if we re not going to do that about President-elect Trump   we should at the very least trust him to do the right thing. Except that Donald Trump is not cool. He s a creep who sexually assaults women and brags about it. He s a selfish wealthy prick who sticks it to the taxpayers any chance he gets. And, like Conway, he s a thin-skinned whiner who can t handle criticism or the truth, which is why Chuck Todd called Conway out. I understand every knee-jerk push back is going to be to blame the media,  Todd said.  It s a crutch. I get it and I m used to it. Not by me!  Conway insisted.  That s not fair! Here s the video via YouTube:Oh, but it is fair, Kellyanne. And it s about time someone in the press called you out for it. In virtually every media appearance she makes, blaming the media is, indeed, the crutch Conway uses when having to deal with tough legitimate questions from journalists. She did it throughout the campaign and she is still doing it now. It s pathetic.Featured Image: Screenshot",

We started off with the idea of doing an ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, and we thought we ll take a bunch of NFL gear and destroy it and start it on fire and burn and donate money to veterans, like they do with ALS,  Wolney said Friday.

        "text": "Republican Rep. Steve King: The base is going to behind President Trump's decision to pardon Joe Arpaio https://t.co/17fLpkPgcf  CNN (@CNN) August 26, 2017CNN was apoplectic about having to cover the hurricane when they had so many opportunities to manufacture news about President Trump. They published this story tonight as Hurricane Harvey was hitting the coast of Texas:3 headlines the White House hopes you ll miss as Hurricane Harvey hitsAs the strongest hurricane to make landfall in the US in more than a decade took aim at Texas, President Donald Trump s White House engaged in an age-old Washington tradition: the Friday news dump.Transgender individuals? Banned from joining the military. Convicted Sheriff Joe Arpaio? Officially pardoned. Controversial White House adviser Sebastian Gorka? Out of a white House job.All three headlines popped after 6 p.m. Friday as TV news broadcasts and websites turned their attention to Texas, where Hurricane Harvey was preparing to make landfall as a Category 4 hurricane   the most powerful to hit the US since 2004.CNN probably forgot about Barack Obama s notorious  Friday night news dumps Here are a few of Obama s greatest hits:From Hot Air:Isn t it funny what you can find out on Friday evening about what our executive branch does? For instance, Agence France-Presse reported last night that Barack Obama bypassed Congress to send $192 million to the Palestinian Authority, claiming that national security required the US to put money into Mahmoud Abbas  pocket.Congress deliberately froze those funds, and not just because of the statehood demand through UNESCO. Hamas, a terrorist organization, reconciled with Fatah and has rejoined the PA, which means we re putting almost $200 million into the hands of a terrorist organization. The language of the Palestinian Accountability Act could not be clearer:  [N]o funds available to any United States Government department or agency   may be obligated or expended with respect to providing funds to the Palestinian Authority.  Obama literally waived that statutory language off yesterday afternoon. From Politico:Reporters and Capitol Hill staff tracking the Solyndra saga know better than to make plans for Friday nights: That s when the Obama administration likes to dump documents requested by Congress.At least five times since last fall s bankruptcy filing and FBI raid of the California solar company, the White House and other agencies have chosen to release embarrassing emails and other materials late in the afternoon as the workweek ends   a time almost guaranteed to garner the least media attention possible.From Townhall:The Obama administration Friday pulled the plug on a major program in the president s signature health overhaul law   a long-term care insurance plan dogged from the beginning by doubts over its financial solvency. Targeted by congressional Republicans for repeal, the long-term care plan became the first casualty in the political and policy wars over the health care law. The program had been expected to launch in 2013.  This is a victory for the American taxpayer and future generations,  said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., spearheading opposition in the Senate.  The administration is finally admitting (the long-term care plan) is unsustainable and cannot be implemented. While President Trump has had a very busy day today, he s clearly not so busy that he hasn t been focused on, and assessing what the federal government can do to help the victims of the hurricane this evening. Here is his latest tweet:We will remain fully engaged w/ open lines of communication as #HurricaneHarvey makes landfall. America is w/ you! @GovAbbott @FEMA @DHSgov pic.twitter.com/PryIqRxgLr  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 26, 2017Here s President Trump s tweet as the hurricane was hitting land in Texas:At the request of the Governor of Texas, I have signed the Disaster Proclamation, which unleashes the full force of government help!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 26, 2017 Where was President Obama when the most serious natural disaster happened during his 8 years in office? He was golfing on Martha s Vineyard, and refused to leave his golfing vacation to assess the situation.President Obama is stirring resentment over his refusal to interrupt his Martha s Vineyard vacation to survey the Louisiana flood   the worst U.S. natural disaster since 2012   while drawing comparisons to President George W. Bush s hotly criticized response to Hurricane Katrina in the same state.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson defended Mr. Obama at a press conference Thursday, insisting that the president is  closely monitoring  the situation but that he will not cut short his two-week breather in the tony Massachusetts resort. The president can t be everywhere,  Mr. Johnson told reporters in Denham Springs, Louisiana.Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, backed him up, saying at the press conference that he is  not complaining in any way about our federal partnership. Even so, Mr. Obama s lack of urgency is drawing unflattering parallels to the federal response in 2005, when Mr. Bush was branded as uncaring and even racist for not touching down during a flyover two days after Hurricane Katrina.

        "text": "Is former DNC Chair Donna Brazile attempting to tie Hillary to the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich in her new book  Hacks ? What does Brazile know? Is she in danger if she says too much? Is Brazile offering just enough information, so that authorities are pressured into looking into a connection with Hillary and Seth Rich s murder?  From her book  Hacks :I felt some responsibility for Seth Rich s death. I didn t bring him into the DNC, but I helped keep him there working on voting rights. With all I knew now about the Russians  hacking, I could not help but wonder if they had played some part in his unsolved murder. Besides that, racial tensions were high that summer and I worried that he was murdered for being white on the wrong side of town. [My friend] Elaine expressed her doubts about that, and I heard her. The FBI said that they did not see any Russian fingerprints there.Daily Caller   Brazile repeatedly returns to the subject of being haunted by Rich s murder, even though other Democrats have pounced on anyone who suggested that the murder was anything other than a robbery gone wrong. The DNC data staffer was killed days before Wikileaks began publishing its emails, and his valuables were not taken.100 Percent Fed Up   The private investigator, Rod Wheeler, who was hired by the Rich family to get to the bottom of the murder of their son, DNC staffer Seth Rich, offered startling information on the Rich murder case when he appeared on the Sean Hannity show on May 15, 2017.  Wheeler spoke about the mystery of why they can t locate the computer Rich used. They went on to discuss clues in the case that point to collusion between the DC police and the DNC. The most shocking information comes at the 4:20 mark when Wheeler says that a  high ranking official at the DNC  wanted to know why he was snooping around.Rod Wheeler:  Here s one other thing that is going to be startling I m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC check this out a high ranking official at the DNC when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around? Shorty after WND wrote a story that outed Donna Brazile as the  high ranking DNC representative who allegedly called the police to ask why a private investigator was  snooping  into Rich s death, Twitter SUSPENDED WND s account!Here s the title and an excerpt from the WND article:BOMBSHELL: DONNA BRAZILE WARNED OFF PRIVATE EYE ON SETH RICH MURDEREx-DNC chairwoman reportedly asked cops why investigator is  snooping  into mysterious case Alicia Powe and Liz Crokin wrote the story that was also posted to and deleted from the social media platform by Twitter: Former Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile is the high-ranking DNC representative who allegedly called police and the family of murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich and demanded to know why a private investigator was  snooping  into Rich s death, the private eye revealed to WND Monday. The high-ranking DNC official that called the police after I inquired about Rich s case was Donna Brazile,  veteran homicide detective Rod Wheeler told WND.  Why shouldn t I reveal who it was? Brazile, who was also a CNN contributor and a Hillary for America donor at the time, was caught providing Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton with questions that would later be asked of Clinton at a televised CNN town hall. In an interview with Fox News before the election, Brazile denied leaking the questions to Clinton. But in a March 17, 2017, column for Time magazine, she finally admitted doing so, saying it was a  mistake I will forever regret. According to WND, their Twitter account was suspended because of this Seth Rich investigation bombshell.Daily Caller   But Brazile says she had a  spook,  with connections to the intelligence community, who told her after the killing that she needed protection for herself, including cameras, alarms and backup power at her house, and that she heeded his advice.I knew the campaign had over $3 million set aside in a legal fund. Could she help me get this lawsuit started? And don t forget the murder of Seth Rich, I told her. Did she want to contribute to Seth s reward fund? We still hadn t found the person responsible for the tragic murder of this bright young DNC staffer. You re right, she said. We re going to get to that. But she really had to go. She had made the call and checked it off her list, and I accepted after we said our goodbyes that I might never hear from her again.",

        "text": "On Wednesday night s episode of Late Night, host Seth Meyers ripped Trump a new one for his continued support of Fox News and his defense of Bill O Reilly. It s not only despicable that Trump (a known sexual harasser) would defend fellow sexual harasser Bill O Reilly, but he did this less than a week after he proclaimed that April would now be known as  National Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Meyers, not one to ever let Trump get away with anything, dedicated his popular segment A Closer Look to this very subject and it was glorious. At the beginning of the segment, Seth focused on Trump s undying, and equally disturbing love and admiration for Fox News and his favorite programs on the failing network. You probably have at least a passing familiarity with Fox News if you ve ever visited an elderly relative or gotten drunk at a bar in a small-town Applebee s,  he said, introducing the segment,  particularly with one viewer, the president of the United States. He then went on to show pictures of Trump s free Twitter advertisements for Fox and said: The President literally just recommends TV shows now. Instead of a Bible, Trump should have been sworn in on a TV guide. That, of course, drew raucous laughter from the crowd, but it s so true! He cannot stop plugging this network and along with himself, he s made Fox News more of a laughing stock than it was before he was elected! Now, he s coming to O Reilly s defense, which is sure to make things worse for the network who has already lost over 20 advertisers amid the newest sexual harassment scandal they just can t seem to get away from, as much as they ve tried to sweep it under the rug. Soon the only advertisers left on his show are going to be Ivanka Trump s clothing line and Steve Bannon s skin worsener,  Meyers joked.Watch the full segment below:Featured image via video screenshot",

        "title": "WHY LIBERAL ACTRESS JENNIFER GARNER Is Bucking Hollywood Haters\u2026Wants To Meet With President Trump",
        "text": "Jennifer Garner has not given up on Donald Trump s Washington.The 44-year-old actress spent the weekend lobbying the town s pillars of power to support early education for poor rural children. She spent Friday on Capitol Hill meeting dozens of top staff members. On Saturday, she delivered the keynote address before the annual National Governors Association winter meeting here. A potential sit-down with Ivanka Trump, who is advocating for more funding for child care, fell apart because of scheduling conflicts, but Garner remained optimistic about a face-to-face discussion soon.Other Hollywood liberals have shunned the new commander in chief   notably during Sunday s Academy Awards ceremony, when many jokes were told at President Trump s expense. But Garner, a true-blue Democrat who campaigned for Hillary Clinton last year and held a fundraiser for Barack Obama in 2008, is taking a unique approach: pushing a cause that would benefit the new administration s political base.The West Virginia native has long worked to bring assistance to poor, rural communities in desperate need of it. She has no plans to change that just because most of those communities went big for Trump in last year s election. In fact, she sees an opportunity to hold the president accountable for the pledges he made to the country s rural working class.While other celebrities merely attach their names to charities to promote themselves, actress Jennifer Garner is actually very involved in helping poor children in her home state of West Virginia.According to a study by British academics, when celebrities lend their names to a good cause, they are usually the main beneficiaries I m looking forward to helping him make good on what they saw as promises, a mandate from him, that he was going to make their lives better,  Garner said in a 45-minute interview with The Washington Post.That makes Trump s presidency a psychological test of sorts for some members of the Hollywood elite, who can either demonstrate their true commitment to the causes they push   or expose their charity work here as more about bolstering themselves.Very much in the former camp, Garner acknowledged that some of her friends  want to turn their back to this administration . . . [and] just wouldn t even want to engage. Not her.  If he s willing to help the poor kids who got him elected, then let s do it. They certainly think he s going to,  she said.She grew up solidly middle class, but she knew plenty of poor children who started elementary school behind and never caught up. They lived in the same sort of communities that Robert F. Kennedy, Shriver s uncle, visited in the mid-1960s along the Mississippi Delta, shaping the ideas of his 1968 presidential campaign.Garner returned home to West Virginia last year to help raise money after devastating flooding in the state. Reliably Democratic during her childhood, West Virginia ended up giving Trump his largest margin of victory   something she could see coming by talking to people in economically depressed areas. People felt like Trump really understood them, that he was going to come in and create jobs for them,  she said.  They felt like they needed something to just turn everything upside down. It s that level of despair that leaves Garner willing to deal with Trump when some of her friends want to offer nothing but resistance. She may even be willing to meet the president. Send me a ticket to Mar-a-Lago. I m ready to go down and have a steak and a good chat,  she said, only half joking about the prospect.  I really think it s great, if he s willing to help the poor kids who got him elected.    Washington PostWe applaud Garner for her courage and her true commitment to poor children in her home state of West Virginia.Watch this short clip explaining why Garner s so passionate about helping these kids in West Virginia:",

There is a noticeable trend toward increasing repressive activities of this kind,  the CCDHRN said in its monthly report.  At the same time, we also identify 95 cases of people who suffered other forms of political repression including physical attacks, police harassment and vandalism and hostile demonstrations. The exercise of all civil and political rights is still a crime,  the group said, noting that the Cuban penal code still includes an offense called  pre-criminal social dangerousness,  which is punishable by up to four years in prison.The country is unlikely to see an improvement in respect for fundamental, civil and political rights  as a result of the government s inflexible posture and its opposition to any effort or proposal leading to the urgent judicial, economic and political reforms that the Cuban people need and deserve,  the commission said.

        "text": "However you feel about Trump as a candidate for President, he s done more in the past few weeks than most candidates have ever done. The most important think he s done is call attention to our open border with Mexico. It s about time someone REALLY acted on this. It s interesting to watch Rick Perry squirm when talking about the border. If you haven t seen one of the most revealing political videos to expose all talk and no action then the video below is EXHIBIT 1: There are a few select moments in broadcast TV when the production content highlights a very distinct reality   and simultaneously informs the viewership on the absurd construct of political dynamics. Last night Sean Hannity did just that.Former Texas Governor Rick Perry has been blasting 2016 GOP candidate Donald Trump over Trump s remarks about illegal alien criminals. Perry s criticism has aided the liberal media s efforts to isolate, ridicule and marginalize Trump.However, using Rick Perry s own Texas border reality, and showing the criminal statistics inherent from Perry s own team, Hannity shows how Donald Trump is right, and Perry is just playing politics. It was one of the best constructed segments Hannity has ever broadcast.The segment begins at 03:35 and runs through 08:12. The most substantial moment comes at 05:35. Watch: DONALD TRUMP WILL VISIT THE BORDER BETWEEN TEXAS AND MEXICO ON THURSDAY:The presidential candidate will arrive in Laredo to meet with a local border patrol union before traveling to the border to address the media. He ll then speak at an event for law enforcement, his campaign said.Trump s camp said representatives from the Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Laredo Police Department, the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will be invited to the second event. The business mogul has soared to the top of the polls as he s called for tougher immigration policies. Many of his comments have unnerved national GOP figures   including remarks from his campaign launch that America is becoming Mexico s  dumping ground  and that many Mexicans who cross into America illegally are criminals or  rapists.

        "text": "Is Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) the member of Congress who s receiving Alzheimer s drugs from the D.C. pharmacist who revealed a dirty little Washington secret about the drugs he delivers to Congress members only 2 weeks ago? Nancy s even more bizarre than usual behavior has led a lot of Americans to question her mental capacity and wonder if she s one of the members who s receiving the medications to treat  serious health problems ?Something is clearly wrong with Nancy Pelosi. Why is everyone in Washington DC and in the media ignoring her bizarre and incoherent interviews that leave viewers wondering how in the world she is fit to serve. American Mirror   During her recent weekly press conference, the House Minority Leader was seen stumbling over words, uttering gibberish, staring blankly at reporters, and on at least two occasions, suffering from face spasms. What an event-filled morning has been,  Pelosi began, botching her opening line.It went downhill from there. Really one that, uh, marks a transf  for  she said, before staring at reporters barely 10 seconds into the appearance, and finally saying,  transformative moment Moments later, she confused  trillions  and  billions. When President Bush left office the deficit was 1.4 trillion,  she said as she suffered an apparent facial spasm,  uh, trillion dollars. So you re talking about an enormous amount of money. The national debt increased by an enormous amount   the debt was 1.4 billion in terms of the deficit. Watch her incoherent interview here:A Washington D.C. pharmacy revealed on Wednesday that they deliver medications that treat  serious health problems  to members of Congress, including medications to treat Alzheimer s disease.Pharmacy owner, Dr. Mike Kim, said that he has  gotten used to  knowing highly sensitive information about some of the most powerful people in Washington, STAT reported. At first it s cool, and then you realize, I m filling some drugs that are for some pretty serious health problems as well. And these are the people that are running the country,  Kim said, listing treatments for conditions like diabetes and Alzheimer s.Kim expressed concern over some of the serious health problems that members of Congress have because the diseases could severely limit their ability to serve in their elected positions. It makes you kind of sit back and say,  Wow, they re making the highest laws of the land and they might not even remember what happened yesterday.   Daily Wire ",

        "title": "U.S. ELECTIONS May Already Be In Serious Jeopardy : ACORN Gives OH Man Cigarettes And Cash To Register To Vote 72 Times\u2026Several More Horror Stories",
        "text": "If you haven t already signed up to help protect the sanctity of our vote in some way do it TODAY! Leisa and I have worked in polling places where crime rate is high and most poll workers are afraid to work. In the city of Detroit, we were surprised to find some very well run polling places. In Pontiac, MI, we experienced something quite different. We saw people using pill bottles as a form of identification. We were physically and verbally threatened by the poll supervisors and watched workers call in reinforcements to stand within our field of vision in an attempt to intimidate us. We are in a war with the Left who has no issue with bending or breaking the rules to win. We re not advocating that anyone put themselves in harms way. We are only suggesting you get involved in some way to protect the sancticy of the vote. Contacting the non-partisan voter integrity organization True The Vote is the best first step. Election integrity and voters  rights organization True the Vote announced that it successfully worked with officials in Ohio to remove duplicate voter registrations prior to the Ohio primary. These registrations were originally submitted by left-leaning and Democrat organizations, including ACORN.Approximately 30 percent of voters registered twice in the Cleveland area and they did so with falsified birth dates, social security numbers, and other identification. These were submitted not only by ACORN, but by Field Works, The Strategy Network, Organizing for America, and other left-of-center organizations, says True the Vote (TTV) in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas.Upon receipt of True the Vote s research, 711 duplicate voter registrations were removed in Cuyahoga County and 465 sets were processed in Franklin County. TTV says it has been notified that thousands of duplicate voter registrations have also been removed in North Carolina. Because of Ohio s consistent role as a decisive swing state in America s elections, it has a duty to ensure that its voter records are in the best shape possible,  True the Vote Founder Catherine Engelbrecht said.  Having duplicate voters in Ohio s poll books not only creates confusion at the polling place, but raises the possibility of fraudulent double voting. The Buckeye State has recently seen first-hand just how far some are willing to go to see their candidate or cause win. TTV notes that the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) had a  well-established track record  of giving local election officials questionable voter registration forms for years, especially in Midwestern and other political battleground states.ACORN bragged about submitting more than 1.3 million voter registrations in 2008 alone. After the organization was formally shutdown, 18 employees were convicted or admitted guilt to committing election crimes.A large percentage of the work that ACORN engaged in has been officially questioned.A Cleveland man said he was given cash and cigarettes by ACORN in exchange for registering 72 times. The complaints started an investigation into the organization and witnesses were subpoenaed to testify against the organization.The New York Post reported in 2009 that eleven ACORN workers in Florida were arrested after submitting approximately 1,400 applications of which about 900 were falsified.More than 2,000 applications were falsified in Indiana and submitted just hours before the registration deadline.As it relates to the 30 percent of Cleveland voters that registered twice, TTV founder Engelbrecht said,  While many voter records may become duplicated due to data management breakdowns, you have a different issue entirely when nearly a third of the irregularities show a pattern of intentional forgery. Engelbrecht warned,  Americans working in the polls and casting ballots must be extra vigilant this year to help spot irregularities that can throw an entire election into question.

        "text": "I am not a psychologist. I don t even play one on TV, but after more than a year of hearing non-stop Donald Trump verbal vomit, it s pretty clear that the man is incapable of not insulting people, even the people this country pretends to revere, like veterans. On Thursday, Trump, for not the first time, insulted a group of his military veteran supporters by saying that he s just as brave as them because he takes financial risks (he doesn t, but more on that in a bit).He started off right, for literally a fraction of a second:With five days to go until Election Day, we almost had a late-breaking campaign first: Donald Trump being self-deprecating. Speaking at a rally in North Carolina Thursday night, Trump acknowledged Medal of Honor recipients in attendance.  Oh, they re so much more brave than me. I wouldn t have done what they did,  Trump said. So far so good.  I m brave in other ways,  Trump continued.  I m brave.  Just different brave. Same same.Source: SlateWatch it here:Okay, Mr. Trump, since you brought up bravery, let s talk about it. You had five draft deferments, officially making you a draft dodger and if your campaign rhetoric is any indication, you re also a chicken hawk. Sending other people to die, so you can  bravely  amass your personal fortune is the opposite of bravery. It s cowardly and it s worse.As for being  financially brave,  hardly. He s  brave  with OPM, other people s money, which is not bravery at all.It s called OPM. I do it all the time in business. It s called other people s money. There s nothing like doing things with other people s money because it takes the risk   you get a good chunk out of it and it takes the risk.Source: BloombergTrump has also filed bankruptcy numerous times, which means he s really irresponsible with other people s money. Why should we expect him to be any different as Commander-in-Chief. He will send other people s children to fight wars that could quite easily bankrupt us. To Trump, that would be just another day. To the rest of the country, it would be devastating.Despite all of this, despite the fact that Trump has insulted prisoners of war, veterans with PTSD, Gold Star families, and the very sacrifices of veterans, the military still supports him, although, by and large, the people in charge do not. Perhaps the military should be listening to its generals and admirals instead of a bloated draft dodger.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",

        "text": "Ta-Nehisi Coates sat down with an interview with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now! on Wednesday, where he said that he  will be voting for Sen. Sanders.  This endorsement is particularly interesting, due to some very real criticisms Coates wrote about Sanders earlier this month.Coates is a correspondent for The Atlantic and won the 2015 National Award winner for his book, Between the World and Me. His essay, The Case for Reparations, is a must read. Late into last January, Coates wrote about some of his frustrations with Sanders  lack of willingness to publicly support reparations for slavery.The criticism of Sanders is one that is both new and old. As Coates notes, people are beginning to look at the issue of reparations from a new historical lens. That new lens is what fuels most of Coates  critique of Sanders  stance on reparations.  That being said, there has always been tension between all the flavors of the black liberation movement, with all of the flavors of the revolutionary left.Coinciding with the rise of the New Democrats, this is an old feud that has largely been missing from the mainstream political discussion for several decades. Indeed, the fact that this debate is once again seeing the light of day is a very good thing to happen. A synthesis of diverging thoughts cannot occur if they are neglected.During the interview, Coates says that he is stunned by the rise of Sanders. Goodman asks Coates why he is stunned. His response is revealing: Well, I think, had you told me this like a year ago, I certainly would not have expected, you know, an avowed socialist to be putting up these sorts of numbers and actually be contending for the Democratic Party nomination. But I think it s awesome. You know, I think it s great. You know, like a lot of people, I m very, very concerned about Senator Clinton s record. I m very, very concerned about where her positions were in the 1990s, when we had some of the most disgusting legislation in terms of our criminal justice, really, in this country s history. I get really, really concerned when I see somebody taking $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs, will not release what they re actually saying. That s concerning. And so, having options, not having this be a coronation, I think, is a good thing. So, I m stunned, but I m pleasantly stunned.

Sisters Sam, 11, and Lola, 10, are reportedly scared to be alone with their father after an alleged string of abusive texts and threatening outbursts.Richards is suing Sheen for $1.2 million after he allegedly evicted her from the home Sheen left to their daughters, Sam, 11, and Lola, 10, in a trust.The suit filed last week alleges that Sheen once texted to Lola:  Your dad is a rock star genius . . . Your mom is a p s wart,  and that he called the girl a  [bleeping] pig whore  while yelling,  I m going to kill you and I m going to kill your mom. In November 2015, Sheen announced he was infected with HIV and had paid upwards of $10 million to keep it a secret.It s not that being infected with HIV is in and of itself a crime, but most people who would hide it while continuing to have sex would be in jail. But then again, Hollywood moonbats are not  most people  and like Hillary and other leftist politicians, they have special rules.In November 2015, The Daily Mail published a story about Sheen with this headline:You are a crack smoking, hooker buying, mentally enslaved moron with HIV.

        "text": "All of these companies should be ashamed to be contributing to a to a company that kills babies, then shamelessly negotiates for top dollar for their aborted body parts UPDATE:Until this Thursday, Planned Parenthood kept a list of corporate allies and sponsors on its website. Once Coca-Cola became the third corporation to ask to be taken off the list, Planned Parenthood took it down altogether.A snapshot of Planned Parenthood s donation page archived one day ago touts support from very large corporations:The news organization Daily Signal contacted several companies on the list asking about their purported donations to Planned Parenthood in light of videos revealing the organization s harvesting of fetal organs. Representatives from Xerox, Ford, and Coca-Cola deserted the abortion giant, saying they were  incorrectly listed as donors  They said their companies do not contribute to Planned Parenthood and do not match employee gifts to the organization. All three said they have contacted or will contact Planned Parenthood to be removed from its website. There are likely more desertions to come. Pro-life grassroots activists will likely keep calling and asking the remaining corporate giants from the list whether they support the sale of aborted baby parts for medical experimentation. But now that the list is down, the world will not know how many more corporations will ask to be taken off the list of Planned Parenthood supporters.Since the gruesome videos began to appear last week, news has gone from bad to worse for the abortion giant. Two Congressional committees are investigating, along with eight state governments. A bill has been introduced in Congress to withhold Planned Parenthood funding for one year. That would cost the $1.3 billion dollar a year nonprofit corporation $500 million. Via-Breitbart NewsIn the wake of two videos allegedly showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of aborted fetal body parts, Republicans in Congress are working to ensure that Planned Parenthood is stripped of its federal funding.However, it s not only the government that fills Planned Parenthood s coffers. According to 2nd Vote, a website and app that tracks the flow of money from consumers to political causes, more than 25 percent of Planned Parenthood s $1.3-billion annual revenue comes from private donations, which includes corporate contributions.2nd Vote researched the corporations and organizations to find which supported Planned Parenthood and found that more than three dozen donated to the group. Some companies donated directly, while others matched employee gifts.Forty corporations and organizations directly contribute to the group.Planned Parenthood has come under heavy fire following the release of videos from the Center for Medical Progress.The first video, released last week, showed Planned Parenthood senior executive Dr. Deborah Nucatola meeting with actors portraying buyers from a  human biologics company.  The  buyers  discussed the sale of fetal body parts with Nucatola over lunch.In the second video, Dr. Mary Gatter, president of Planned Parenthood s medical directors council, is seen negotiating the price of aborted fetal body parts.Here are the 40 companies that have directly funded Planned Parenthood.

Those Ipsos state polls show Trump clinching leads in New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Maine.That s really big because President Barack Obama won all those states in 2012. Obama won Wisconsin by 6.7 points, Michigan by 9.5 points, Maine by 15.1 points, and New Hampshire by 5.8 points.The firm s accumulation of state polls, however, still leaves Clinton far ahead of Trump in total electoral votes.The likely difference between Ipsos   which conducts polling for the Reuters news service   and the many other polling firms is their turnout prediction for November. Winning the White House depends as much on who comes out to vote as which candidate Americans prefer. Each week, we poll more than 15,000 people, then factor in likely turnout among key demographics to see how voting would play out in the Electoral College,  according to Ipsos. Currently, Reuters/Ipsos estimates overall turnout at around 60%, although that rate varies among different demographic groups. Minority turnout, for example, is expected to be about 43%, while about 59% of African-American women and 69% of White men are projected to cast ballots,  according to a site run by Reuters and Ipsos.

Behar went right to the root of the problem and declared that without a doubt, gender had played a huge role in how this election played out.Whoopi Goldberg began the conversation by voicing her concerns about Trump, stating that his misogyny and racism truly make him a terrifying choice for America. She said: I have to say, given the bigger picture of what Donald Trump represents, it is not so comfortable for me because not only does he now threaten how things are going to be done with kids of color, with women s rights, with my right to decide what is right for my body, not what somebody else says what is right. Goldberg wondered  whether we are a nation who believes in people s rights as they are Constitutionally guaranteed. Behar responded with a brutal truthbomb, making reference to the fact that even in the year 2016, sexism allows less qualified men (or in this case, completely UNqualified men) to come out ahead of women who are over-qualified. Behar said: You know what I learned. I learned that, as usual men can get away with anything and women can get away with nothing. That s what I learned. He was unbelievably decisive, bigoted, racist, homophobic, against handicapped people, against John McCain, and yet he won. She made some mistakes, but not like that. Exactly. There is no other plausible reason why a reality televison star with zero political experience and several lawsuits (including fraud and sexual assault cases) against him should have been able to win a presidential election over a former Secretary of State who has given the last several decades of her live to serving this country.You can watch Behar speak the truth below:This election showed America that we are far from the post-racial society we thought we were, and that sexism is more than alive and well today.

We told you exactly what you needed to do and you did nothing,  one man told the city council members at the meeting.Two protesters who were holding a sign that read  Blood on your hands  climbed up on top of the dais, at which point several members of the city council got scared and ran away. Police eventually removed several people from the meeting and arrested at least three of them, which prompted the crowd to chant Shame  and  Shut it down. Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy, was the only official who had the guts to stay and try to negotiate with the protesters, who have every right to be pissed off that Nazis were given a permit to spread their hate and violence throughout Charlottesville. The protesters called for Mayor Mike Signer to resign from his position, chanting  Signer must go! After making it abundantly clear that they do not appreciate the city council inviting white supremacists to town, they also demanded the removal of Confederate monuments from Charlottesville. The city agreed to begin the removal process and a motion was approved by the council that will commemorate the victims of the Nazi rally by draping black fabric over the statues.Watch more on the mayhem here, via WVIR: NBC29 WVIR Charlottesville, VA News, Sports and WeatherFeatured image via video screen capture",

        "title": " MUST-SEE: Protester Hurls Tomatoes At Donald Trump During Iowa Rally (VIDEO)",
        "text": "During a Wednesday rally at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, a protester hurled tomatoes at Donald Trump after the Republican presidential frontrunner referred to Bernie Sanders as a  communist. In a news release, officials said Andrew Joseph Alemao, 28, was observed throwing two tomatoes at Trump, the real estate mogul and front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.Alemao has been charged with disorderly conduct, a simple misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $625 or 30 days in prison. He is currently being held in the Johnson County Jail.He was taken into custody by the Secret Service and the UIPD after throwing the tomatoes, the release said.At least three Sanders supporters were apparently escorted by security out of the rally, with Trump shouting,  Get  em outta here!  to the cheers of his fans in the crowd.Not one of the tomatoes actually hit Trump.But it shouldn t matter.Frankly, regardless of how vile, obnoxious and ultimately dangerous Trump might be, there s simply no excuse for anyone to engage in physical violence against him, or any public figures for that matter. It s childish, unacceptable behavior   especially for liberals who ought to know better. If activists are incapable of making an argument using words, evidence and reason, they should figure out how it s done, rather than embarrassing the rest of us (especially other Bernie supporters) by lashing out like an infant who refuses to eat and hurls his food at the wall in protest.The same goes for pie attacks against William Kristol and Ann Coulter, or red paint attacks against Condoleezza Rice. In fact, at the time, I wrote something similar when a protester attacked George W. Bush by throwing shoes at the former president. Feel free to applaud these kinds of attacks   I m sure it s cathartic   but know that by encouraging such atrociously violent, kneejerk behavior, you re only encouraging more of it.And, so, don t be surprised when conservative activists retaliate with the same thing against liberal leaders and celebrities, not unlike how a pissed off wingnut attacked Hillary Clinton back in 2014. Put another way: it s probably not difficult for Trump supporters to worm their way into Democratic rallies.Just to be clear: it s entirely possible that the tomato-tosser wasn t a Bernie supporter at all.

        "text": "Now that Ted Cruz has dropped out of the presidential race and Donald Trump looks like he s going to be the Republican nominee, Sarah Palin came out in full support   and stupidity   for her favorite candidate.Taking to her Facebook page, Palin made a video where she praised The Donald and thanked his supporters for believing in the disgraced frontrunner. She said: To all of you who believed in making a real difference in our politics and in the way things have been done in the past that have put America in a pretty precarious position. Thank you so much for supporting Trump and believing in this idea of being able to make America great again. We re finally on the road to do so, but we do have to unite first. The former governor of Alaska, who is also the failed GOP vice presidential candidate of 2008, has decided that she s more than qualified to predict the success of a Trump presidency, and has a message for any  smart Democrats  that might be listening. Her advice to them? Unite behind Donald Trump. Addressing  GOP and independents and smart Democrats,  Palin said: Truly it is time to come together, pull together   remember that united we will stand, our country will stand united. Divided, we re going to fall. So now, after participating in some really healthy, kind of arduous competition, and now, more than ever, it s time to come together and put some differences aside. Stand on principle, that principle that, yeah, we have opportunity to make America great again. We ve needed a revolution, and we ve found our revolutionary. Thanks for all your hard work. Congratulations, Donald J. Trump   and here we go, on the road to make America great again. You can watch the video below:Sarah Palin is one of those GOPers that we wish would just go away, but she always seems to find a way to put herself back into the spotlight and remind us of her existence. When Trump decided to run for president, Palin had found her political soulmate and didn t hesitate to back him. The crazy thing is, she thinks the rest of us are stupid enough to follow in her footsteps.To ask Democrats to unite under a party that has built their values on hate and inequality is ludicrous   and you have to possess a special sort of stupidity to even suggest this. Most Americans   even many Republicans   know that Trump is in no condition to lead the country. So no matter who the nominee for the Democratic party is, the majority of the country will be voting blue in November. No one   not even the GOP   wants to see Trump in the White House.Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",

        "text": "Legendary actor Robert De Niro was in Sarajevo on Saturday to accept an award in recognition of the anniversary of his character in the film Taxi Driver. But while speaking about the movie, De Niro compared his character of Travis Bickle, who has psychological issues and violent tendencies, to the Republican nominee. I don t know, it s crazy that people like Donald Trump he shouldn t even be where he is, so God help us,  he began as the crowd cheered. What he s been saying is really totally crazy, ridiculous   he is totally nuts. But I think now they are really starting to push back, the media   finally they are starting to say: Come on Donald, this is ridiculous, this is nuts, this is insane. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, Donald Trump has drawn outrage from around the world with his offensive and threatening remarks ever since he entered the race for the Republican nomination in June of last year.Perhaps most worrying to people living in Sarajevo is Trump s refusal to rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe.But Trump s outbursts have also included claims that the upcoming presidential election is rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton and his call for  Second Amendment people  to do something to stop Hillary Clinton from nominating liberal judges to the Supreme Court, which is essentially a call for gun nuts to shoot her.Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose capital city is Sarajevo, is probably also concerned about Trump s ties to Russian president Vladamir Putin, especially since the Republican nominee has threatened to pull American support from NATO and Russia has been aggressive in Eastern Europe.Make no mistake, Trump is crazy and the people in Sarajevo and the rest of the world really appreciated De Niro for speaking out against Trump at a time when many Americans really do want an egomaniacal dictator wannabe in the White House.Featured image via screen capture",

        "text": "Nobody seemed more desperate to win Iowa by sheer force of will than Rick Santorum. The perennial Republican also-ran staked his entire campaign on convincing enough ultra-conservative Iowans that he was their guy, and didn t just come up short   he hardly came up at all.But if Iowan voters didn t know Santorum was running, the hapless employees at the state s ubiquitous Pizza Ranch restaurants sure did. For some reason   some very, very insane reason   Santorum decided to almost exclusively stump in the pizza chain s locales. By the close of the primary, Santorum had racked up an impressive (or sad, depending on how you look at it) 120 visits, that s nearly two visits per location.CNN s Chris Moody covered the Santorum s Iowa bid, and while he clearly tried to remain objective   and we give them an  A  for effort, really   his recollection of Santorum s sad campaign radiates a sense of bafflement and failure.About forty die-hard Santorumites joined together in a private room at a Pizza Ranch restaurant. The evening was full of nostalgia, sadness and hope, and a pinch of denial, to celebrate a man who hosted more than 700 events in the Hawkeye State. It has been an honor. It really has,  Santorum said.  I hope we have another opportunity, but my guess is that when we come in on Air Force One, we re not going to have these types of deals because we re going to have a country to run. The crowd laughed, lovingly, knowing that what he said wasn t true and probably would never be.There may be nothing more fatalistic than holding what is probably your last campaign rally in the back room of a greasy pizza shop and joking about how someday you may be unable to come in because you re too busy on Air Force One. It s never going to happen   that s the punchline.To twist the knife of failure just a little bit harder, Santorum s Pizza Ranch base of operation is actually already spoken for. The company s CEO, Adrie Groeneweg, announced just weeks ago that he would be endorsing Trump.Groeneweg has never endorsed a candidate before and he has also never caucused.  It was just something my dad has always done,  he explained. This year, Groeneweg said he d go to caucus for Trump in February.Hilariously, Trump didn t even have to show up beforehand. In trademark fashion, Trump only decided he liked Pizza Ranch after he learned the CEO endorsed him.Meanwhile, all the pizza slices in the state couldn t buy Santorum some love.But there is one silverlining to this story. Taking pity on poor Santorum, Pizza Ranch did throw him a bone. They gave him a t-shirt and made him an  honorary employee.

        "text": "We re giving asylum to people who re connected to terrorist organizations AND releasing illegal alien criminals onto our streets. The Obama regime sure doesn t like Americans. Asylum was given because they loosened the rules in February of 2014 and they could then let these terror connected people in:Such applicants would have been rejected prior to Feb. 2014, according to Judicial Watch. That s when the Obama administration announced that DHS could exercise discretion whether to grant asylum to aliens  who provided limited material support. We just reported today on the thousands of illegal alien criminals that Obama just let go last year including 353 illegals convicted of sexual assault! Now we have foreigners with ties to terrorism coming to live here! Isn t it enough to have the thousands of refugees our State Department is just shipping here without fully vetting or letting the people know? Lord help us!Obama administration granted asylum to more than 1,500 foreigners with ties to terrorist organizations last year because they were deemed to have provided support to the groups  while under duress. The figures are contained in an annual report that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) sent to Congress this month. The conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained the report and published it online Tuesday.During fiscal year 2014, USCIS applied exemptions to 1,519 foreigners with ties to terrorist organizations who applied for discretionary relief. Of that total, 806 of the foreigners granted discretionary relief were for refugee applicants while another 614 were applicants for lawful permanent resident status.Of the 1,519 with terrorist associations, 627 provided material support,  while under duress,  to undesignated terrorist groups. Another 189 provided material support,  while under duress,  to designated terrorist groups.Designated terrorist groups are the most dangerous. They are classified as Tier I and Tier II organizations and include groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, al-Qaeda and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.Nine foreigners granted relief received military-type training,  while under duress,  from terrorist groups; 28 provided voluntary medical care to members of terrorist groups; 37 were qualified aliens who had existing immigration benefits who had  provided material support to, solicited funds for, solicited individuals for membership in or received military-type training from Tier III terrorist organizations.USCIS asserts that applicants are thoroughly vetted and pose no terrorist threat to the U.S. Applicants  names and fingerprints are compared against terrorist watch lists. Following that process, individual applicants are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Department of Homeland Security.Such applicants would have been rejected prior to Feb. 2014, according to Judicial Watch. That s when the Obama administration announced that DHS could exercise discretion whether to grant asylum to aliens  who provided limited material support. Read more: Daily Caller",

        "text": "House Speaker Paul Ryan is hugely unpopular, garnering only a 29 percent approval rating. Apparently, 8th graders disapprove of him, too. While on a field trip in Washington, D.C. on Friday, about half of the 8th-grade students from a South Orange Middle School refused to do a photo-op with Ryan. Instead, the nearly 100 students opted to sit in a parking lot across the street while the remaining students took part in the photo op, according to Mashable.Elissa Malespina, a school librarian and the parent one of the eighth graders who declined the photo op, said that she is proud of her son. I am so proud of my son and 1/2 the 8th grade at South Orange Middle School,  Malespina wrote on Facebook.  They went to D.C. on a field trip and toured the Capitol building. The kids had a chance to have their picture taken with Paul Ryan and over half the class choose not to, including my son! What a powerful statement. I can t take a picture with someone who supports a budget that would destroy public education and would leave 23 million people without healthcare,  Matthew Malespina, a student at the school, told The Village Green. It s not just a picture,  student Matthew told ABC News.  It s being associated with a person who puts his party before his country. I think that taking the picture represents that you agree with the same political views and I don t agree with his political views so I chose not to be in it,  eighth grader Wendy Weeks said.To some of the students, it had to do with Ryan s association with Donald Trump. I didn t want to be in [the picture] because he believes in most of what Trump believes in,  Louisa Maynard-Parisi, told The Village Green.Even though their politics might be different from Ryan s, other students decided to participate. I thought it would be interesting to see one of the nation s lawmakers in person even if I strongly disagree with many of his views,  said Alex Klint, one of the 8th-grader s said.Residents weighed in with conflicted feelings. I m sort of torn on this (although each kid has the right to make this choice),  wrote one SOMA resident.  Even though I totally disagree with everything he stands for, he is a legitimately elected official and represents our government at work. Meeting our representatives is an honor for a kid at least for what the office stands for (even if the person occupying that chair is less than honorable). And I do feel if there had been some conservative school where the kids refused to pose with President Obama, we would have been appalled by that,  the resident added.Matthew s mother told the paper,  It is his right as a citizen to do so and I commend him and his fellow students for doing so in a respectful way. Listen to the children they get it. Photo by Olivier Douliery via Getty Images.",

        "text": "The story you ll never see in the mainstream media..When Corporal Ryan Stickney and 200 of his fellow Marines prepared to return to their families after Operation Desert Storm in 1991, a logistics error forced them to turn to a surprising source for a ride home: Donald J. Trump.Today, Stickney would like to say  thank you. Stickney (left), was a squad leader in a TOW company of a Marine reserve unit based in Miami, FL and spent approximately six months in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War between 1990 and 1991.Upon his unit s return to the United States, the former Marine says the group spent several weeks decompressing at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina before heading back to Miami.Stickney recalls being told that a mistake had been made within the logistics unit and that an aircraft wasn t available to take the Marines home on their scheduled departure date.This according to Stickney is where Donald Trump comes in. The way the story was told to us was that Mr. Trump found out about it and sent the airline down to take care of us. And that s all we knew .I remember asking  Who is Donald Trump?  I truly didn t know anything about him,  the former Marine said.Corporal Stickney snapped a photo to remember the day by:The Trump campaign has confirmed to Hannity.com that Mr. Trump did indeed send his plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami, Florida to transport over 200 Gulf War Marines back home. No further details were provided.The Marine says he and his family are to this day grateful for Trump s kind gesture.  It may not seem like much to most people, but it was very important to a bunch of jar heads and more importantly their families waiting for them on the hot tarmac. Stickney says that his father a Korean War veteran and former Eastern Airlines captain claimed to have never seen a 727 turn around and refuel so quickly. His father was so appreciative of Mr. Trump s help; he said he would fly for Trump for free to thank him for what he did.Sticky says that in his 28 years of public service, he has yet to see this kind of support for the troops from any of the other candidates running for president:  I have not seen a Clinton or Sanders plane, or anything else for that matter, sent to support the troops.

        "text": "Sacrifice is for the peasants When Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio hosts a reception for a string of A-list stars, supermodels and wealthy philanthropists later this month, he will make an impassioned plea for more action to be taken on global warming.But instead of holding the event in Los Angeles, where most of his guests are based, they will fly halfway around the world to the glitzy French resort of St Tropez   at enormous cost to the environment.Last night, green campaigners were quick to criticise 41-year-old DiCaprio, who in February used his Best Actor acceptance speech at the Oscars to warn about the dangers posed by climate change.The reception   the grand-sounding Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation Annual Gala To Fund Climate and Biodiversity Projects   will be held on July 20 at the Bertaud Belieu Vineyards on the French Riviera.Celebrities including Kate Hudson, Charlize Theron, Cate Blanchett, Marion Cotillard, Penelope Cruz, Robert De Niro, Scarlett Johansson, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kevin Spacey are all expected to attend, along with a host of international rock and pop stars, supermodels and tycoons.And while a table seating 12 people at the gala costs up to  125,000, the real price will be paid by the environment.If just one guest among the 500 invitees chooses to fly the 12,000-mile round trip from LA to St Tropez by private jet   a notoriously environmentally unfriendly way to travel   they will produce 86 tons of carbon dioxide greenhouse gas.Even those who use a scheduled flight will be responsible for releasing seven tons of CO2   leading green campaigners to ask why the event could not have been held in Hollywood or in St Tropez during May s Cannes Film Festival, when many of the guests would have been there anyway.Robert Rapier, an environmental analyst, said:  DiCaprio demonstrates why our consumption of fossil fuels continues to grow. It s because everyone loves the combination of cost and convenience they offer. He believes that no sacrifice is necessary; just Government policies that can provide him with a solar-powered yacht or jet, or that give individuals low-cost renewable energy on a broad scale. One guest who attended last year s gala said:  It s basically a big party for Leo and his showbusiness friends and models. The models, of course, do not pay for tickets, and neither do the VIP guests   they get to have a nice big free party. Via: Daily Mail",

Every year, EPA agents help put dozens of Americans in prison for breaking U.S. environmental laws. Environmental crimes range from spilling coal ash into public waterways, to pretending to produce biofuels, to illegally cleaning up asbestos in buildings.Interestingly enough, EPA has not fined or jailed anyone for the spilling of three million gallons of mine wastewater in August. That month, EPA workers opened up the Gold King Mine and sent a toxic plume of mine waste though rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. Toxic mine waste even went through Navajo Nation territory and resulted in farms having their water supplies shut off.Republican lawmakers were quick to criticize EPA for not taking any disciplinary action against contractors or employees involved in the Colorado mine spill. Lawmakers noted that while EPA drags its feet, a private company, like Duke, would have been fined quickly if it had spilled mine waste.The Department of the Interior s outside review of the spill incident found EPA could have avoided a blowout if it had taken precautions agency workers had used while opening other sealed Colorado mines.Interior found that had the agency used  a drill rig to bore into the mine from above  to open Gold King  the mine would have been revised, and the blowout would not have occurred. The EPA has taken responsibility for the spill, but still hasn t taken actions against agency workers who opened up the mine mouth. In fact, lawmakers are worried the agency is trying to taint a federal investigation into the spill.Read more: Daily Caller",

        "text": "Clearly, Trump supporters want Fox News to lie to them.Because when Fox News host Shep Smith fact-checked Donald Trump s accusations against Hillary Clinton in regards to the Uranium One deal with Russia, they lost their shit.Smith thoroughly debunked Republican claims that Hillary Clinton approved the deal in a pay-to-play scam during her time as Secretary of State back in 2010.First, the deal had to be approved by a committee of nine agency heads, who unanimously approved.Second, the State Department was represented by an assistant who says Clinton did not intervene.Third, the Uranium One deal stipulates that the uranium must be sold to civilian reactor operators in the United States, which blows Trump s claim that Hillary gave 20 percent of our uranium to Russia out of the water.Fourth, one man gave the Clinton Foundation all but $4 million of the $140 million donated by nine individuals associated with Uranium One. And that one man had already sold his stake in the company years before in 2007, well before Clinton even thought about being Secretary of State. And long before Barack Obama became president to make her Secretary of State.And, finally, Clinton had no power to veto or approve the deal herself.So, that means conservatives have no case against Clinton, effectively neutering any effort by the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor since doing so is contingent on the facts. And the facts support Clinton. So much so, that any court would laugh the obviously manufactured charges out of court.Here s the video via YouTube.In response, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum and called for Fox to fire Smith for reporting the facts.You need to get that hack @ShepNewsTeam out of Fox.

In his final years as Maricopa County sheriff, Arpaio had emerged as a leading opponent of illegal immigration. I am seriously considering a pardon for Sheriff Arpaio,  the president said Sunday, during a conversation with Fox News at his club in Bedminster, N.J.  He has done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration. He s a great American patriot and I hate to see what has happened to him. Trump said the pardon could happen in the next few days, should he decide to do so.Arpaio, 85, was convicted by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton of misdemeanor contempt of court for willfully disregarding an Arizona judge s order in 2011 to stop the anti-immigrant traffic patrols. Arpaio had maintained the law enforcement patrols for 17 months thereafter.The man who built a controversial national reputation as  America s toughest sheriff  admitted he prolonged his patrols, but insisted he did not intend to break the law because one of his former attorneys did not explain to him the full measure of restrictions contained in the court order.He is expected to be sentenced on Oct. 5 and could face up to six months in jail. However, since he is 85 years old and has no prior convictions, some attorneys doubt he will receive any jail time.Citing his long service as  an outstanding sheriff,  the president said Arpaio is admired by many Arizona citizens who respected his tough-on-crime approach.Arpaio s widely publicized tactics included forcing inmates to wear pink underwear and housing them in desert tent camps where temperatures often climbed well past 100 degrees Fahrenheit. He also controversially brought back chain gains, including a voluntary chain gang for women prisoners.  FOX News ",

        "title": "Hillary\u2019s Secret Weapon: Evan McMullin is CIA-Goldman Sachs candidate, backed by Mitt Romney\u2019s Wall Street Machine",
        "text": "J.R. Smith 21st Century WireMuch has been made by Democrat Hillary Clinton and the White House s accusation that Russia is trying to influence US elections,  although neither has presented any real evidence to back up this extraordinary claim. On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence documenting the CIA interfering and altering numerous foreign elections throughout history. This raises an interesting question: would the CIA ever try to interfere in an US election? Evan McMullin is a 40-year-old self-described conservative Mormon   and  former  CIA operative. I enjoyed being a grey man,  said McMullin of his 11 years in the CIA.On the wall in his Salt Lake City campaign offices is a poster which reads  007 for President. That s a bit worrying, if indeed McMullin fancies himself as a James Bond character, but in a way it really sums up what his presidential run is all about   working in the  grey  areas, in back room meetings with GOP establishment luminaries, colored by private and public deception. It s what the CIA has specialized in for decades; manipulating and perverting hundreds of overseas elections   all in the interest of transnational corporate elites (like Mitt Romney), and now it seems they have an inside man nested in another key position  Oddly, the media often introduces him as a  conservative columnist    seemingly in an effort to distract from his total insider pedigree. McMullin is no  newcomer  or fresh face   he is a career operative, inserted into special niches, including his most recent stint as Congressional director of GOP policy. Now he s come out of the shadows to play a key role in the US election   on behalf of some very powerful interests.According to Real Clear Politics, McMullin describes his work as a clandestine operative for the CIA in both Iraq and Afghanistan, in  all the war zones post-9/11 until 2010 and most of the other hostile environments . He admits his job was to  penetrate insurgent and terrorist groups as well as foreign governments , recruiting agents to pass information  to take these people off the battlefield   either capture or kill them. Interesting skill set,  penetrating  governments. We can safely assume that also entails subverting elections overseas, or maybe using Saudi Arabian cash to buy weapons for Jihadi terrorist  rebels  in Syria.Not surprisingly, McMullin trumpets a loud anti-Putin and anti-Assad rhetoric which is almost perfectly in synchronization with that of Hillary Clinton s. Like Clinton, McMullin relies on a campaign of fear set against Russia and Syria in an attempt to try to bracket Trump togther with other overseas leaders currently under a  demonization order  by the Washington DC establishment. Donald Trump is an authoritarian just like Vladimir Putin, just like Bashar Al-Assad, just like the Communist regime in China. I have worked against and around authoritarians overseas and I know them when I see them. Donald Trump is one of them. He would bring the same kind of economic stagnation, internal turmoil and discord to our country that other dictators bring to their own. I m sure the Kremlin considers Donald Trump by far its most successful intelligence operation ever. It s very clear that Vladimir Putin and his regime have some control over Donald Trump. Trump s support for Putin is the only thing he has been consistent on. The following is straight off of McMullin s campaign website, under the heading of,  America s Role in the World : Evan will impose tougher sanctions on Russia and increase America s military presence in the Baltics in order to deter and reverse Putin s aggression, rather than pretending that he is a partner for peace in Syria. Evan will stand up for the rights of American and allied ships to sail freely in international waters, rather than letting China dominate the Western Pacific. This statement could ve just as well have written by the CIA s office of forward information planning, or from the office of Hillary 2016, take your pick.The next line in his r sum  should also throw up a big red flag: he s also a former operative at Goldman Sachs investment bank. So, CIA and Goldman Sachs. Aside from bank-rolling Bill and Hillary Clinton s political machine for the better part of the last 15 years, Goldman also backed Mitt Romney s failed 2012 presidential run.The connections here between all of these establishment players is undeniable   with McMullin sitting comfortably in his CIA  grey  area.Stealing Utah for Hillary If we can send a strong message here from Utah, it will change the discussion in Washington and across this country,  said McMullin.This is the problem with the contrived McMullin campaign: it will not impact the national political discussion.Since he announced his candidacy three months ago on August 8, 2016, his  campaign  has only really existed inside Utah, but conveniently amplified by an US corporate mainstream media   and the very same media outlets that have been demonstrably pro-Clinton, anti-Sanders and anti-Trump since the very beginning of the presidential race.Evan McMullin s primary directive seems to be to steal Utah s 6 electoral votes away from Republican candidate Donald Trump   who is currently enjoying a comfortable lead over Hillary Clinton in Utah. Recent polls show Trump and McMullin running neck and neck in Utah, at 30% and 29% respectively. In an already tight national race between Trump and Clinton, those 6 electoral votes could easily decide the national election   in favor of Hillary Clinton.Aside from Utah, McMullin is also hoping to steal away Republic votes in key states with substantial Mormon populations like Arizona, Idaho, and Wyoming. McMullin is hoping to exploit Mormon voter blocks over the issue of Donald Trump s bolshy demeanor and alleged past sex scandals   a negative which will resonate with conservative Mormon voters in places like Utah.Based on the incredible amount of national media access he s being given across all of the top establishment broadcast TV networks, it s pretty clear that the McMullin campaign is being engineered at the highest levels. For a candidate who appeared from nowhere in the last two months, he s enjoyed carte blanche airtime, including softball interviews on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd, The Week with George Stephanopoulos, as well as primetime slots on pro-Clinton media outlets CNN, CBS, NBC, and of course, on Democratic Party channel MSNBC.Here s his debutant spot on Morning Joe, where McMullin waxes on about how,  George Bush kept this country safe after 9/11 , and other familiar platitudes: When McMullin speaks, you can almost hear the voice of Mitt Romney and the old GOP establishment. If the Republican Party can t make the changes, as wasn t able to do after 2012, the conservative movement will need a new political vehicle,  said McMullin to Stephanopoulos.From these sort of statements, we can see that the object of McMullin s campaign is the same as Romney s   to keep the Republican candidate from winning on November 8th.Establishment scion Mitt Romney (photo, left) and his Wall Street partners are desperate, and deathly frightened that if Donald Trump wins, he will build a new GOP power base   one which is not based on a tight elite Wall Street investment bank circle that uses men like Romney as their intermediary to control govemnent affairs and fix markets   but rather, real people power based on grassroots, working class and middle class voters.The other subtle piece of the McMullin deception is how he constantly spins in the mainstream media about how a Clinton victory is already a fait accompli. In other words:  Trump has already lost, so cast your vote for me as a protest vote against the winner, Hillary Clinton.  By applying that subtle spin, McMullin hopes to avoid being fingered as Mitt Romney s #NeverTrump tool.Getting on enough ballots in enough states requires money, and a political machine. Enter the Team Romney McMullin s ability to get on the ballot in 11 states, and also  write-in  access in 32 others, was financed and run by a 501c3 Not for Profit organization which, like McMullin, suddenly popped up this year. It s called,  Better For America,  said to be founded by GOP operatives John Kingston and Joel Searby.When asked whether or not he s backed by Mitt Romney, McMullin always says  no , but the facts say otherwise. Here we can see clearly that McMullin is a creation of Mitt Romney s so-called #NeverTrump Movement. McMullin s primary backer in this project appears to be Kingston, who just happens to be a former GOP delegate from Massachusetts and donor to former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, as well as executive producer for the 2014 documentary, Mitt.In addition, McMullin s running mate is former Mitt Romney campaign staffer, Mindy Finn. Aside from working in the Bush Administration, Finn also worked for Twitter and Google, specifically building their tech networks with the Washington Beltway. Another total insider.McMullin has also been working with former Mitt Romney campaign strategist Stuart Stevens.Behind the patriotic rhetoric in Better For America s marketing spin is well-financed, laser focused operation to steal Utah from the Republican party. In public, the organization claims that: We deserve better than two candidates that are deeply unfavorable among a majority of the people they claim to represent. Together, we can give a voice to the millions of Americans who cannot in good conscience vote for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. If a third party candidate emerges, they need to know the support they have on the ground among the nearly two-thirds of Americans said they are willing to support an independent candidate. Better For America s claim is disingenuous at best, if not outright deceptive, not least because there were already third, and fourth party candidates   Gary Johnson (Libertarian Party) and Jill Stein (Green Party), both of whom have been organizing in all 50 states. This casual ignorance of the other alternative candidates indicates an attempt to totally manipulate the electoral conversation.Very underhanded yes, but this is something a CIA operative would be doing overseas thrawrting elections and destablizing fledgling democracies in target nations. Romney and Goldman Sachs End GameBeyond engineering a narrow victory for Hillary Clinton, Mitt Romney and the #NeverTrump conclave s last option is to steal the election after Nov 8th. It goes like this .Their final play would be if neither Trump nor Clinton receive the 270 electoral college votes required for an outright victory   which would then send the election to the House of Representatives. This hasn t happened since 1825. At this point a Republican House of Representatives (many of whom are #NeverTrump supporters) would choose any of the top three candidates who had won a state. If McMullin wins Utah, then he would theoretically be in with a chance. But not as good a chance as Hillary Clinton would.Regardless, either scenario (although the Clinton scenario is more real) is predicated on Evan McMullin s role as a spoiler. McMullin admits this openly: It depends on the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump being very, very close and it is not close now. For Clinton friends and campaign backers like Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and fellow Wall Street elites, a Donald Trump victory could mean an interruption in profits   slowing down the financial organized crime and fiat paper fraud which has enriched them and the Clintons (and soon the Obamas too) ever since Bill Clinton gave Goldman and Co. the ultimate blank check when the outgoing US President repealed the Glass Steagall Act in 1999. With that one stroke of the pen, the Clintons set the stage for the 2008 Financial Collapse   and bailout recipient Blankfein and the Goldman syndicate (and Romney too) made vast fortunes off other people s misery. Notice that Goldman and Wall Street have been stuffing money into the Clinton s pockets ever since with speaking fees, jobs, investments, and also bank-rolling Chelsea Clinton s husband Mark Mezvinsky s hedge fund.Blankfein and his ilk brought the US economy to its knees, and were paid handsomely for their effort.It s an incestuous ring of financial skull-duggery   and you will not hear the righteous, self-styled  liberty  advocate Evan McMullin so much as mention any of this, let alone bad mouth his former employer and criminal financial institution   and yet, this is the real story that everyone should really be talking about this election   the seedy relationship between the likes of Goldman Sachs and the establishment s favored political candidates.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV ",

        "text": "Accidents are bound to happen when Democrats become so comfortable with their allies in the liberal media that they forget they re on TV, as they expose themselves and their crooked administration to a national audience.The Conservative Treehouse does a brilliant job of dissecting the interview between former Obama administration official Evelyn Farkas and MSNBC s Mika Brzezinski. They also offer evidence of a fake disinformation campaign that was spread by the Obama regime about a Trump- Russian connection. [UPDATE to story below]This is stunningly interesting and hopefully will be picked up by MSM and congressional investigators.Sometimes when a person is deep inside an echo-chamber of like-minded ideologues, they might not realize what they re saying is rather revealing to those on the outside. That s the set up for former Obama administration official Evelyn Farkas (Deputy Asst. Secretary of Defense) appearing on MSNBC and admitting first hand knowledge the Obama administration spied on candidate and president-elect Donald Trump s transition team to gather  intelligence  for political use.It would appear Ms. Farkas was so caught up in the discussion, she didn t quite realize the significant admissions she was making about the Obama administration spying on Donald Trump s team and generating classified intelligence for Ms. Farkas (and others) to spread to Capitol Hill politicians. MSNBC s Mika Brzezinski recognized the  oh-snap  admission and tried to play it off,  but by then it was too late.With the help of MSNBC, simultaneous to her admission of first-hand specific knowledge of the administration spying on Mr. Trump, Ms. Evelyn Farkas outs herself as the key source for a New York Times report which discussed President Obama officials leaking classified information to media.Considerable irony jumps to the forefront when you recognize, the New York Times tried to protect Evelyn Farkas as the source of their reporting by stating: More than a half-dozen current and former officials described various aspects of the effort to preserve and distribute the intelligence, and some said they were speaking to draw attention to the material and ensure proper investigation by Congress. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing classified information, nearly all of which remains secret.  (link)D oh.Whoopsie.Looks like Devin Nunes and the House Intelligence Committee has a new person to bring in for testimony. A positive development because at this rate the media leakers will out themselves without much need for investigation.I wonder what the criminal penalties are for having access to intelligence and sharing it with Democrat politicians [ The Hill People ].Question #1:Who, specifically, are these  Hill People  you speak of Mrs. Farkas?Watch again. Longer version starts at the 4:50 mark:https://youtu.be/cVGp2FZmVA4  Evelyn Farkas has stated freely on TV that she and a group of associates from the Obama Administration went to congressional staffers who did not have access to these COMINT products and urged them to seek to gain access to them.At some point in the recent past Farkas was de-briefed (cut off) from access to the various kinds of compartmented information she had been given as a requirement of her prior job. When that occurred she signed some papers in which she accepted the responsibility to protect the secrecy of that information. (link)  Evelyn Farkas is also a senior fellow of the Atlantic Council  SEE HERE  the Atlantic Council is funded in part by the US State Department, NATO, the governments of Latvia and Lithuania, the Ukrainian World Congress, and the Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk. The Atlantic Council has been among the loudest voices calling for a new Cold War with RussiaAnd guess who else is a senior fellow of the Atlantic Council? Dimitri Alperovitch   the founder and CTO of CrowdStrike! Alperovitch is head honcho of the Atlantic Council s  Cyber Statecraft Initiative .  CrowdStrike, aka Dimitri Alperovitch was the organization that initially claimed they had evidence the Russians were connected to the Trump organization. A claim they have subsequently walked back   SEE HERECrowdStrike has retracted statements it used to buttress claims of Russian hacking https://t.co/8AZOvoQl0K  Michael Tracey (@mtracey) March 28, 2017Combine all of these data-points and you discover that Evelyn Farkas was essentially part of a disinformation campaign with Obama insiders spreading a fake DNC constructed story using false information. However, in addition to pushing the false Trump Russian conspiracy narrative, Farkas has knowledge of the outcome of the original pushing of the narrative leading to actual surveillance of the Trump team.This bolsters the information already presented by Devin Nunes that an entirely separate network of surveillance, unrelated to the Russian conspiracy story, was directly targeting the candidacy of Trump and the post-election surveillance of the President Elect Trump-transition team.For entire story: The Conservative Treehouse",

What on earth did this priest do? Well, he fought for religious freedom Yes, Vietnam is still holding others in situations just like this. Soooo Vietnam throws us a bone and releases just one prisoner as a gesture so Obama will lift the arms ban? WHY NOT HOLD OUT FOR ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS?Vietnam has freed one of its longest-serving political prisoners, just a few days before a visit by Barack Obama in which human rights is expected to be a key talking point.Nguyen Van Ly, a Catholic priest who has spent most of the past two decades in detention due to his relentless pursuit of democracy and religious freedom, was released from a prison in central Hue province after his fourth stint behind bars. They released him in a special amnesty by Vietnam s president before the Obama trip,  Catholic priest Phan Van Loi told Reuters by phone.The communist country s state-controlled media has made no mention of Ly s release, which comes as Obama weighs whether to lift an arms embargo on Vietnam, a decision Washington has long said would hinge on human rights progress.Loi said that he met Ly after his release and that although he appeared weak, he was in high spirits.The US embassy in Hanoi welcomed the release of Ly but said other dissidents should be freed too. We call on the government to release unconditionally all prisoners of conscience and allow all Vietnamese to express their political views peacefully without fear of retribution,  an embassy spokesman said.During Ly s long periods of incarceration, sometimes in solitary confinement, he suffered numerous health problems, including strokes and partial paralysis.Ly s release on Friday was three months before the end of an eight-year prison sentence for  anti-state propaganda , which comes under a section of the criminal code that rights groups say is vaguely worded and used to punish outspoken critics.The priest has been on the receiving end of some of the country s harshest verdicts, stemming from his opposition to the political monopoly of the Communist party. He set up a pro-democracy movement and was behind several banned publications.Human rights is a thorny issue for Vietnam that has created dilemmas for western governments keen to engage with one of Asia s fastest-growing economies but alarmed by the arrests, harassment and jailing of its detractors.Via: The Guardian",

        "text": "The New York Times published a piece displaying the 282 people Donald Trump has insulted on Twitter since he announced his run for the White House. It had to be a  daunting task for the paper because the GOP nominee uses his Twitter account like a punching bag against anyone who hurts his tender feelings. The GOP presidential nominee needs to be in an anger management group instead of social media. According to Donald, though, the people he lashed out at deserved it. It s ok, most of them deserved,  Trump said on ABC s  Good Morning America. I believe in fighting back when people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, I have the power of this instrument and frankly sometimes I ll use that,   he continued.  And I agree sometimes it will revert back or sometimes maybe it doesn t come out   you have to be careful with it. Melania Trump was also interviewed. She explained that as First Lady, she would focus on social media. The wife of a cyberbully said, What s going on is very hurtful to children, to some adults as well. We need to teach [children] how to use it, what is right to say, what is not right to say, because it is very bad out there and children get hurt,  she added without one bit of irony.Trump said that he agreed that so many people are  hurt  by social media. She feels very strongly about. She understands it very well,  Trump said.Trump hasn t changed. Even before his run for the presidency, he insulted random Twitter users.  Are you making less than minimum wage, don t worry, the government will protect you. Afraid to give your real name? You should be,  Donald tweeted to a Twitter user in 2013. By the way, Trump blocked that Twitter user after the exchange.Imagine if Barack Obama lashed out at random people on the Internet because people hurt his feefees in 2008   then in 2012.Donald continued his  rigged election  rhetoric in the interview. That s likely because he s preparing himself for defeat in November. He won t take losing gracefully and neither will his supporters.Image via screen capture. ",

        "text": "They re calling them  Y all Qaeda.  It s all at once appropriate and ridiculous. The fact that a group of armed traitors are occupying a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge shouldn t be treated as a cute internet meme, but there it is.Rather, this is serious business made more serious by the infuriating reality that local law enforcement appears to be allowing it to happen without much interference.According to The Oregonian, police officers were nowhere to be found during the Saturday rally at the site which led to several members seizing the headquarters at the refuge. Furthermore, law enforcement hasn t revealed its plans   if any   to repel the militia from the government land. And now that Ammon Bundy, the son of Nevada secessionist ranched Cliven Bundy, has taken over as the leader of the occupation, the militiamen are sure to be joined by more attention-seeking seditionists.But going back to the lack of law enforcement presence. Do we really need to underscore the lopsided injustice here? Do we really need to emphasize the fact that if this had been Black Lives Matter activists or, hell, Islamic terrorists, how the facility would ve been surrounded and the situation greeted with law enforcement gunfire. If just one African-American gunman has stepped foot into the building, recent history and more than enough video footage has proved that the black gunman would ve been decimated in an onslaught of police gunfire. Full stop.Instead, a group of secessionist weekend warriors with enough disposable income to play military dress-em-up are being allowed to seize government property   taxpayer-owned land and facilities   in an effort to exert their independence from the rest of the nation, law enforcement appears to be completely blas  about it. Why? The answer should be obvious.So, what next? If these bastards want a fight, and if they want to die for their stupid cause, give it to them. They ve seized our land. Mine. Yours. It s time to stop dicking around and show them they re not above the law just because of their white privilege.Featured image via Twitter",

And their sheer ignorance has cost them a key staff member in a key swing state.Trump s campaign chair in the prominent Mahoning County in Ohio, Kathy Miller, has resigned from her position after denying there was any racism in the 1960s and that if black people weren t successful in the last 50 years, it s their own fault. She also said there wasn t  any racism until Obama got elected  and skirted problems under the table:If you re black and you haven t been successful in the last 50 years, it s your own fault. You ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn t have. You had all the advantages and didn t take advantage of it. It s not our fault, certainly.Miller then doubled down, calling the Black Lives Matter movement a  stupid waste of time  and said low voter turnout in the African American community as due to  the way they re raised. What does  the way they re raised,  supposed to mean? Maybe Miller should take a look at the fact that the Trump kids didn t vote (and couldn t even vote for their dad) before speculating on how an entire race raises their kids.Miller resigned, gave a half-ass apology, and distanced herself from the campaign. Of course Trump s Ohio state director, Bob Paduchik stressed that Miller s comments were not reflective of the campaign, and reduced her position to that of a simple  volunteer  to steer away any influence she once held.Once again, the Trump campaign deflects, blames, and dodges responsibility. Oh, and it once again shows that it s being run by a bunch of entitled white racists.Featured image a screen-grab",

        "text": " Apparently, the U.S. leader has attitude issues.  President Barack Obama has been slated by his own brother   and revealed he will back Republican Donald Trump in the Presidential race. Speaking live from Kenya on British TV, Malik Obama also spoke about his relationship with Barack and claimed he has to make appointments to see him. And he told Good Morning Britain hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid that the US leader has issues with attitude. He said:  [Barack] has this attitude like  I m the president, I ve made it, I m the star here . I do understand that but I m just expressing my opinion and how I feel.  In a swipe at his sibling s incredible political career, Malik added:  Looking back, he made so many promises when he was running for president. He was riding on the promise of hope. There was so much excitement and we thought he would do so many things.  But look at the Middle East right now. It s a mess. People are being killed all over the place; Berlin, Florida, France, Brussels. And look at the situation in Iraq right now.  Malik also sounded pretty miffed when he revealed he has to request an appointment when he wants to see his brother.  I have to go through this woman and make a request, saying I would like to see him,  Malik added.  Then I just have to wait. The last time I requested to see him was June 15th and I ve only just got a response.  And that s how it usually works. It all depends on whether there s an opening in his diary.  The most shocking point Malik made during the interview was that he plans to vote for Barack s rival Donald Trump in the upcoming U.S. elections.Although the president is backing his friend Hilary Clinton for the job and has made no secret of his feelings towards Donald, Malik was more than happy to explain why he isn t supporting his brother.  Something is going on with Hilary that I don t like,  he explained.  Donald on the other hand, he speaks his mind and is straight forward.  And remember, the Republican party is the party of Abraham Lincoln   who freed slaves and freed the black man.  ",

        "text": "Ford will export the next-generation Focus compact car from China to North America in 2019, rather than from Mexico as earlier planned, saving the company $500 million, a top executive said on Tuesday.It is the first major manufacturing investment decision made by new Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett, who succeeded Mark Fields in late May.Discussion about the small-car production shift from Mexico to China began  a couple months ago  under Fields, said Joe Hinrichs, president of global operations.In January, after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized Ford for shipping small-car manufacturing to Mexico, Ford said it would kill plans to build a $1.8-billion Focus plant in San Luis Potosi and instead produce the new Focus at an existing plant in Hermosillo.Although it is cheaper to build and ship cars to the United States from Mexico than China,  this was not a variable cost decision,  Hinrichs said in a Tuesday morning briefing. It allows us to free up a lot of capital  because Ford now has to retool only one plant   the existing Focus factory in Chongqing   rather than two to supply North America.Given dwindling overall U.S. demand for small cars such as the Focus,  we thought this was the best balance of that cost/capital tradeoff,  Hinrichs said.He said Ford planned to inform the White House Tuesday.Asked if Ford was concerned about having to pay a border tax, as Trump has threatened on vehicle imports from Mexico, Hinrichs said  the capital saving outweighs the risk  of a potential tax on the Chinese-built Focus.Ford stock fell 0.8 percent at $11.15.

Makayla s mother Tysa was in Smith s house at the time of the shooting, along with several other friends and family members.According to Merill Carter, who is Smith s cousin and was a witness to the event, Makayla went into the kitchen to retrieve a gun and then shot Smith in the head. An Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation said: Terry and Tysa drove over to Mario s residence to check on Mario. Tysa had been in a relationship with Mario, but hadn t heard from Mario in quite some time. Terry reported that evening, she and Tysa both had a bad feeling about Mario, like something was not okay with him. Mario (the victim) was on the west side of the kitchen bar and was searching for his  stash.  Terry saw Mario bend down. At the time Mario bent over, Terry saw Makayla pull out the caramel-colored gun and shoot Mario in the head. Smith was found on the kitchen floor, lying in a pool of his blood two days later. He was killed just one day before he was due in court for 14+ felony charges of methamphetamine, marijuana, stealing, firearms, assault and battery.According to reports, it seems as though Makayla s mother was not involved in the shooting. The affidavit said: When Mario was shot, [the victim s cousin Merrill] Carter could hear Tysa yelling and crying and he saw she was visibly upse. Carter didn t think Terry had anything to do with Mario s death either. According to a report by an unnamed woman, Makayla was laughing and bragging about the incident two days later. The source said that Makayla had gone into her house and was  openly bragging about killing him. In speaking to authorities, Makayla admitted that the reason she shot Smith was because he had been abusive to her mother in the past. Alexis Terry, a friend of Tysa s, backed up Makayla s claim that Smith was abusive to Tysa.You can watch the report below:Makayla is now being held without bond in Payne County, and is being charged as an adult.This is truly a heartbreaking and difficult situation. It s uncertain what exactly took place right before Makayla shot Smith, but now a child is facing murder charges for trying to protect her mother, when she is not even been old enough to grasp the consequences of her actions. It s unfortunate that it was so easy for her to get her hands on a gun and take action. Now, she is facing the consequences that are meant for someone much older than herself.Should a child be thrown in jail for killing their mother s abuser?Featured image is a screenshot",

Simply stated, the message was that Donald Trump s values are not the values of America.Watch video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPY1vQoT5wU] While it s true that America has many problems to overcome like racism, income equality, we are a society that dehumanizes women, and our politicians religiously support apartheid and racism in Israel, we are a work in progress and we can be better and many of us truly work to be better.Donald Trump and the rest of the GOP clowns running for the nomination are all that s ugly in America. It s an America that the majority of us try to improve. Having one of these people as president would not only normalize this ugliness, but it will make it worse.

Muslim Americans keep up safe,  Obama told the audience, crediting the contributions Muslims have made to communities.  They are our police. They are our fire fighters. They re in (the Department of) Homeland Security. President Obama has had to repeatedly, patiently explain during the course of his presidency that the United States is not at war with Islam, but in fact relies on practitioners of the faith to serve side by side in the war against international terrorism.By contrast, Republican conservatives have constantly demonized Islam, acting as if its followers are monolithically pro-terrorism, when in reality the violent acts have been carried out by an extremely small sect. Top tier Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has gone the furthest, calling for a Muslim registry and a ban on Muslim travel to the country.In the speech today, President Obama explained: We are one American family. We will rise and fall together. He specifically spoke out to young Muslim Americans, who may feel lost and shunned thanks to extremist right-wing rhetoric about their faith: You re right where you belong. You re part of America too. In the speech, Obama also called on the media to do more to include Muslims in films and television shows, pointing out that Muslims shouldn t just be cast in roles about terrorism, but rather in roles that reflect their diverse standing in American life. The President pointed out that this has been done before, as there once were not many portrayals of black Americans in film/tv.Featured image from YouTube",

I ve never seen a Congress that has been so obstructive and so contrary and so committed to doing anything that will foul up this administration. I just think it s an absolute scandal that he has had so little cooperation,  he said.  So anyway, you hit a nerve and I ll go on forever. But I ll just say it a third time: Every day that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama are in the White House is a day that I am thankful for. Obama isn t the only politician Taylor is supporting: The singer said he s on the Hillary Rodham Clinton train, too. And aside from the fact that she s a woman running, she s the right person.   The whole point   black or white, male or female, gay or straight, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, atheist   it doesn t matter what these other connections are,  he said.  Our country needs to come together and the question is,  Is this public servant someone who will bring us together?  And I think she is. Taylor will release a new album,  Before This World,  on June 16, and will perform a concert for SiriusXM at The Apollo in New York City on the same day. He will also launch a U.S. tour in July.Via: AP News",

        "text": "Mexico has been the beneficiary of our open borders for decades. It s really quite amazing how loudly they cry foul when we finally have a presidential candidate willing to stand up to this insanity and say,  ENOUGH! It s Time to put Americans first! Illegal immigrants send home $50 billion annually but cost taxpayers more than $113 billion. Approximately 126,000 illegal immigrants emigrated from these three nations to the U.S. since last October and federal officials estimate at least 95,500 more will enter next year.The Central American governments have encouraged the high levels of emigration because it is earning their economy billions of dollars! For every illegal alien that sneaks into the U.S. and remits money back home, that grand total remittance number only grows. But what if the millions of U.S. jobs now filled by illegal aliens were done by American workers earning better wages, paying more in taxes and spending their money in their communities rather than sending it abroad?Americans are the ones forced to pick up the $113 billion tab for taking care of the country s 12 million illegal immigrants. Is it the responsibility of taxpaying citizens to cover the cost of illegal immigration and the government s aid to these countries while illegal workers continue to send their money overseas to send $50 billion overseas? Via: immigrationreform.comYet, somehow Donald Trump is to BLAME for wanting to shut down our open borders and bring some sanity back to our nation that is being overrun by Mexican drug runners and gang bangers coming from every corner of Mexico, Central and South America? A new Mexican movie promoted by Univision host Jorge Ramos portrays a drunk vigilante motivated by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s anti-immigrant rant killing at least four illegal immigrants at the border.The trailer for the movie, Desierto, now in Mexican theaters, blasts out Trump s initial criticism of illegal immigrants as a man armed with a rifle guns down targets crossing under barbed wire.https://youtu.be/V48ttgGqsswIt later shows the same man, in a pickup holding a bottle of what appears to be whisky, a beer can nearby, as a voice says,  Welcome to the land of the free.  The trailer ends with,  words are as dangerous as bullets. The Center for Immigration Studies on Tuesday first blogged on the  exploitation  movie and the promotion by Ramos on his Sunday show Al Punto. This material resonates powerfully with Jorge Ramos. His conviction that racism and xenophobia are the driving forces of opposition to illegal immigration is a central theme of his nightly newscasts. Ramos fixates on reports that confirm his conviction with the obsessiveness of an exploitation film director showing close-ups of bullets tearing into human flesh,  wrote CIS Fellow Jerry Kammer.He added:  On Sunday, Ramos talked with  Desierto  director Jonas Cuaron and star Gael Garcia Bernal about Trump s repugnant comments about Mexicans. Since then, Ramos said,  there are thousands if not millions of North Americans who feel that they have the absolute freedom to be racists. Via: Washington Examiner",

        "text": "Republican nominee Donald Trump s outreach to win over minorities has been a disaster, and what he just said about a group of exonerated men is probably going to end whatever support he had.Trump had been big on accusing the  Central Park Five    the five teens wrongfully accused of raping a woman in Central Park   ever since the case blew up in 1989. During that time, Trump had taken out a full-page ad in the New York Times blaming the teens, and using them as the reason why New York State should bring back the death penalty (ironic, because Trump himself has been accused of rape several times). The ad, which was signed by Trump himself, said: They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. Just to be clear, these were minority TEENAGERS  one was Latino and four were black   and Trump called for their death. Decades later, Trump continues to double down on those comments. According to a CNN report, Trump revealed that he still thinks these five men are guilty, despite the fact that they were exonerated and awarded $41 million for wrongful imprisonment in 2002. Trump said: They admitted they were guilty. The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same. Yes, Trump still believes these men are responsible for what happened to Trisha Meili, despite the fact that DNA evidence pointed to Matias Reyes, who confessed to the crime.Trump has questioned the release of the Central Park Five before. After the men were released and received their settlement in 2014, Trump said,  Settling doesn t mean innocence. Fortunately, no one has forgotten Trump s racist past with the Central Park Five, and are spreading this information far and wide just weeks ahead of the election. This is certainly a bad time for Trump to be reminding everyone how racist he is:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterIt s mind-boggling that Trump still cannot accept their innocence, despite the evidence. But perhaps this explanation by Michael D Antonio, the author of The Truth About Trump, will shed some light onto it: He s not a person who takes in new information and then adjusts and accepts reality. The only reality that matters to him is his judgment, which was rendered many years prior. Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",

        "text": "Several uncomfortable videos have surfaced this week, showing former Vice President Joe Biden groping little girls. Apparently, according to a former secret service agent, Vice President Joe Biden is not only interested in touching little girls in inappropriate ways, he s also someone the Secret Service felt they needed to protect from their female agents.Here s one example of Creepy Joe touching and rubbing a little girl who is clearly uncomfortable with his inappropriate actions:Big League Politics  Cassandra Fairbanks dropped a bombshell report on Gateway Pundit, where she released a stunning report from a former Secret Service agent assigned to the Vice President Joe Biden residence claims that the Service often had to protect female agents from him.Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the agent asserted that,  We had to cancel the VP Christmas get together at the Vice President s house because Biden would grope all of our wives and girlfriend s asses.  The annual party was for agents and Navy personnel who were tasked with protecting the Biden family. He would mess with every single woman or teen. It was horrible,  the agent said.According to the source, a Secret Service agent once got suspended for a week in 2009 for shoving Biden after he cupped his girlfriend s breast while the couple was taking a photo with him. The situation got so heated, the source told Cassandra Fairbanks, that others had to step in to prevent the agent from hitting the then-Vice President.Additionally, the agent claims that Biden would walk around the VP residence naked at night.  I mean, Stark naked  Weinstein level stuff,  he added.He said that the men on duty would frequently stand in front of female agents and Navy women that were present  like a damn guardian.  On some occasions, they would make up reasons to get the women away from where he was.The agent said he was specifically concerned about women in the Navy. They weren t allowed to disobey him at all, but we d take them away under pretend auspices,  the agent stated.Best-selling author Ronald Kessler wrote about Biden s problem with female agents in his book The First Family Detail.Go to the 2:00-minute mark to hear Kessler tell Sean Hannity how Vice President Joe Biden likes to swim naked in front of female secret service agents:Next time you hear the liberal media talking about how Judge Roy Moore should step down from his bid to become Alabama s next US Senator, with absolutely no evidence that he has ever even made a teenage girl feel uncomfortable  remember the actual videos of Joe Biden, the so-called future of the Democrat Party, groping numerous little girls in plain view of the media, and of the little girls families, while everyone tried to pretend it wasn t happening.

The president is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism, until he determines that they can be properly vetted and do not pose a security risk to the United States. The order barred entry for people from six Muslim majority nations, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the U.S. implements stricter visa screenings.The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals called the national security concerns an after-the-fact justification for a policy that was  intended to bar Muslims from this country. Rights groups that have been fighting the policy in the courts said the justices should not allow the travel and refugee bans to take effect. Again and again, our nation s courts have found that President Trump s Muslim ban is unconstitutional. We will continue to defend our plaintiffs  right to live free from fear of discriminatory treatment by the federal government,  said Karen Tumlin, legal director of the National Immigration Law Center.

McCain s OpEd in The Washington Post is a horrible hit on Trump. Shame on him!It starts out with a statement about how horrible the white supremacists are and then goes on to discuss Congress getting back to order. It s a snoozer of an OpEd until you get to the last part In a shocking slam on President Trump s character and knowledge of government, McCain shows his bitterness towards Trump. He claims that,  We don t answer to him   but also say that,  We must respect his authority WTH!MCCAIN: IT S TIME CONGRESS RETURNS TO REGULAR ORDER: We can fight like hell for our ideas to prevail. But we have to respect each other or at least respect the fact that we need each other.That has never been truer than today, when Congress must govern with a president who has no experience of public office, is often poorly informed and can be impulsive in his speech and conduct.We must respect his authority and constitutional responsibilities. We must, where we can, cooperate with him. But we are not his subordinates. We don t answer to him. We answer to the American people. We must be diligent in discharging our responsibility to serve as a check on his power. And we should value our identity as members of Congress more than our partisan affiliation.I argued during the health-care debate for a return to regular order, letting committees of jurisdiction do the principal work of crafting legislation and letting the full Senate debate and amend their efforts.We won t settle all our differences that way, but such an approach is more likely to make progress on the central problems confronting our constituents. We might not like the compromises regular order requires, but we can and must live with them if we are to find real and lasting solutions. And all of us in Congress have the duty, in this sharply polarized atmosphere, to defend the necessity of compromise before the American public.SEE WHAT HE DID THERE? He basically said our president is clueless and impulsive so we don t need to listen to him. Unreal! Is McCain bitter and trying to get back at Trump?

        "text": "The more a Trump run for the White House as a major party candidate sinks in, the more his blatant incompetence stands out. In this recent interview with Greta Van Susteren, Trump is discussing possibilities for the vice presidency, which Trump has announced will be unveiled at the GOP convention. The convention, already guaranteed to be the circus the sideshows have been building up to, will definitely have the highest viewer ratings of all time. Trump then hints that his VP pick will most likely be a person with a political background because he believes passing legislation is more important than using executive orders to get things done.Then it happened. The thing that will bring Donald Trump to his knees. He pretended to know what he was talking about and said something incredibly stupid. As the race goes on, more people with a little bit of knowledge about something are going to hear something like this and realize immediately that it s amazing that Donald Trump ever graduated high school. He s a showman who built a movement of stupidity on social media and reality television. His remarks to Van Susteren about executive orders prove that he is completely incompetent to hold the office that issues them:  We re not gonna do the executive order thing like Obama. He couldn t get anything passed You re not gonna do executive orders?  asked Van Stern,  No executive orders? Well, we ll see,  says Trump,   It depends on what, but President Obama has been signing a lot of executive orders nobody s ever heard of an executive order before. I mean, I know Bush signed them and other people have signed them, but all of a sudden it s like this major event to get things done. It would be nice to go back to the old-fashioned way   it s called passing legislation; having people get together to pass legislation. You can just hear Joe Pesci doing a scene from Goodfellas.  Hey, yo What the hell is dis  zecutive order bullsh*t. At ain t The way we do things in Hell s Kitchen.  It s ridiculous. President Obama and a team of lawyers combed the laws and precedents of our country, being fully qualified and empowered to do so, and imposed directives to the agencies under the purview of the executive branch, like the INS, as any chief executive of any company would do to those under him. When the president signs an executive order it doesn t become a law, it becomes the current policy of the federal government in its own dealings.That certainly can have a profound effect on shaping federal law, as it sends a profound statement, but as for the bulk of executive orders, they cover the mundane to the ridiculous and have been signed by every single United States President. President Obama has signed fewer than either of the Bush buffoons or Uncle Ronny Reagan. Donald Trump doesn t even need to be prompted to Palin himself. He just does it by complete instinct at this point.",

        "title": " Republicans Plan To Strangle The Supreme Court To Death In Retaliation For A Hillary Victory",
        "text": "Making sure that Democrats take control of the Senate just became even more important.Ever since Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Republicans have refused to let President Obama fill the vacant seat he left behind on the Supreme Court bench. President Obama even nominated Merrick Garland, whom many consider to be a moderate who has even been praised in the past by the very Republicans who are blocking him now.There had been rumors that Republicans may approve his nomination if Hillary Clinton wins the election in order to prevent her from nominating someone more liberal to the post. But now it appears Republicans have something even more sinister in mind if they end up keeping control of the Senate in November.Arizona Senator John McCain, despite joining with his fellow Republicans to declare that the next president should get to pick the next Supreme Court Justice, has already urged Republicans to block any nominee Hillary Clinton puts forward, only to backtrack when outrage ensued over his remarks.But most Republicans think that s a good idea and want to take it even further by letting the Supreme Court die.As we all know, Supreme Court Justices may be appointed to serve for life, but they don t live forever.All of the medical technology and advances in the world are not enough to provide eternal life to humans. So even if every current Justice vows to serve till their last breath, new Justices will eventually be required to make sure the Supreme Court continues.Republicans, however, would rather the high court just disappear instead of doing their jobs by holding confirmation hearings for any of Hillary Clinton s nominees. And they seem to be getting their new playbook from Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute, a right-wing organization funded by the Koch brothers.Apparently, Republicans have decided that if they can t get the conservative dominated Court they want, they ll settle for destroying it entirely so that it is no longer a functioning institution. As a matter of constitutional law, the Senate is fully within its powers to let the Supreme Court die out, literally,  Shapiro wrote for The Federalist on Wednesday. I simply can t blame politicians who follow their convictions,  he continued.  If you truly believe that a particular nominee would wreak havoc on America, why not do everything you can to stop him?  So when you get past the gotcha headlines, breathless reportage, and Inauguration Day, if Hillary Clinton is president it would be completely decent, honorable, and in keeping with the Senate s constitutional duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee she names. In other words, Republicans have no intention of letting the next president pick the next Supreme Court nominee, or any nominee for that matter, unless the next president is Donald Trump. For all their talk of letting the voters decide who gets to pick the next nominee, Republicans are making it clear that they will ignore the will of the people if they elect Hillary Clinton on November 8th and will reject every nominee she puts forward.That means the Court will drag on with only eight Justices, which will result in more cases that result in 4-4 ties that fail to settle the law, which would give red states the power to have state laws that conflict with our Constitution. Essentially, it s a way to shift power to the states by default. And it would only shift more as other Supreme Court Justice die or retire. Once the Court bench dwindles too much, the Justices will have an even harder time keeping up with the case load, which means justice will be delayed.And this strategy could even affect lower courts as well. Without courts to keep them in check, conservatives could pass any laws they desire knowing that courts will be too backed up or are nonexistent to stop them, meaning more anti-gay laws, voter suppression laws, and anti-women laws will be enacted by red state legislatures with impunity.It s an impending constitutional crisis that Republicans are orchestrating.This a dangerous interpretation of the Constitution and it runs contrary to the established precedent that has been set since America s founding. No Senate has outright refused to hold confirmation votes on any nominees put forward by a sitting president. While the Senate has voted a handful of nominees down, they ve never blocked any and all nominees picked by a president no matter how divided the executive and legislative branches are politically.But that s exactly what Republicans are planning to do if Hillary Clinton wins and they get to keep control of the Senate, which means at least two more years until Americans can flip the Senate to more reasonable lawmakers. And it could actually end up being four more years of gridlock since the party that controls the White House often suffers midterm election losses.In short, the only thing that can prevent Republicans from letting the Supreme Court whither on the vine and die is the American people in this presidential election. Republicans must NOT be allowed to keep control of the Senate. The viability, functionality, and survival of our judicial institutions depends on Democrats taking back majority control of the Senate. If voters fail to do this, it could mean the end of the Supreme Court and justice in America.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",

        "title": "SHARPTON SHAKES DOWN PASTORS FOR DONATIONS AT MEMORIAL FOR BLACK YOUTHS: Black Pastor Calls Sharpton A \u201cPimp\u201d",
        "text": "Hey Al  Why don t you try going into the neighborhoods of Chicago and ask the residents to contribute to your worthless charity? Everyone knows  Shakedown Al does nothing to help the hundreds of young black men who are killed by other black youths every year. It s all about the contributions to Al and his worthless  charity At a Hartford, Connecticut rally supposedly called to protest five homicides of young people in the city over the past two weeks   four of them shootings   Rev. Al Sharpton was challenged Saturday by a black pastor for asking every preacher present to donate $100 to Sharpton s civil rights organization, National Action Network (NAN). I want to be here to see a memorial for the young people that have died,  said Sharpton at Shiloh Baptist Church, according to CT News Junkie.  I want the names and their stories up so children can see they don t want to be on that wall. Pastor Marcus Mosiah Jarvis of Christ the Cornerstone Praise and Western Tabernacle, however, shouted at Sharpton as he strode down the center aisle of the crowded church,  How dare you ask the people of Hartford to give you their money! You re nothing but a pimp! Jarvis slammed Sharpton for using the supposed anti-violence rally as a cover for  coming into a community where people are struggling for jobs, struggling for money, and demanding money to speak. Don t you come up in here asking us for money,  Jarvis yelled, according to Fox CT.Jarvis was about to be escorted out of the church, but he instead remained in the rear. Sharpton responded to his challenge by removing $1,000 in cash from his suit pocket. Everything that you all raise will go to a memorial,  he said.  [F]or the lives that could have gone on to cure cancer. Lives that could have been the next President of the United States. Sharpton founded NAN in 1991. As Breitbart News reported in April of last year, the IRS fined the nonprofit for not properly reporting its taxes, and it was charged with $1.9 million in back taxes and penalties. Additionally, the New York Times reported last November that Sharpton owes more than $4.5 million in state and federal taxes. Mr. Sharpton has regularly sidestepped the sorts of obligations most people see as inevitable, like taxes, rent and other bills,  reported the Times.The rally was the culmination of a march through Hartford in which Sharpton and about 150 mostly black individuals participated. Rev. Dr. Boise Kimber invited Sharpton to speak.According to the Hartford Police Department, the city saw 49 shooting victims between January and May 16.Jarvis later said local efforts are essential to initiate change in a community, reports CT News Junkie. We re setting in place classes where people can come for credit repair, establishing credit, home ownership, creating a resume, how to look for a job, mock interviews  that s how you empower people, not creating memorials,  he said.Via: Breitbart News",

        "text": "If there s one conclusion to draw from the horrific shootings that have been happening over the course of this past week, it s that we, as a society, need to have more understanding and compassion for one another. No one deserves to die, especially not for merely existing, or protecting your community.Two black men were shot and killed by police officers who didn t even try to keep them alive for reasons yet to be determined, and five police officers were shot and killed, with seven more injured while serving and protecting protesters who were out voicing their concern over police brutality.Many have been offering their opinions on the violence that s been happening, but one voice of reason seems to really get at the heart of what needs to be heard, and that is the voice of Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).The simple, yet solid truth of all the killings that have occurred over the past week was summed up in this tweet by Warren: Black Americans shouldn t be killed in routine traffic stops, and police shouldn t be killed while protecting and serving their communities. Black Americans shouldn't be killed in routine traffic stops, & police shouldn't be killed while protecting & serving their communities.  Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) July 8, 2016It s really that simple. We can be on both sides of this issue and not be against the other side. We can have compassion for the rights of Black Americans to exist without fear of being shot and killed by the police, and we can also have compassion for police officers who are merely trying to protect the community they serve.We need to stand up to and against violence wherever it is, period.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",

        "text": "The best way to not get fired, get kicked out of school or booted out of the military if you re a Nazi, is to not do Nazi stuff. Apparently, one Marine just couldn t stop himself and was arrested at a pro-Confederate rally (where we re totally sure it was just about his  heritage ), and took it upon himself to unfurl a banner with a white supremacist slogan   allegedly.Staff Sgt. Joseph Manning was stationed at the Marine Corps Engineer School at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina at the time he was arrested on May 20th in Graham, North Carolina, and charged with first-degree trespass, a Class 2 misdemeanor, the Military Times reports.Manning and fellow active-duty Marine Sgt. Michael Chesny are accused of climbing a building and unfurling a banner with the letters  YWNRU  on it, The Times-News reported on May 27. The letters reportedly stand for  You will not replace us,  which is the slogan for Identity Evropa, a white nationalist group founded by Marine veteran Nathan Damigo.How Nazi is that you ask? Well, you didn t ask but that s the same slogan we heard in the Vice video which showed Nazis storming the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia during the  Unite the Right  hate-rally which rocked the nation and resulted in one Trump-supporting white supremacist using his car as a weapon to mow down anti-racist protesters, killing one and injuring at least 19 others. The  You will not replace us  chant from racists turned into  Jews will not replace us  during the march.Manning is presently in the process of  being administratively separated from the Corps,  according to the Military Times.Capt. Joshua Pena, a spokesman for Training and Education Command, said the investigation is part of the administrative process and its results cannot be released publicly.Manning s career in the Marine Corps lasted 15 years, beginning in 2002, His military awards include the Purple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, Iraq Campaign Medal, and Afghanistan Campaign Medal and he threw that all away so that he could act like a f*cking Nazi. And even though his banner read,  YWNRU  (you will not replace us), he was certainly  replaced. Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.",

        "text": "House republicans have vowed to fight fire with fire, with Steve King, Republican Representative from Iowa, stating that they are willing to begin a new investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails unless Democrats stop fanning the flames of the scandal involving the President Trump s potential collusion with Russia during his election campaign. If this continues this immobilization of the presidency over these kind of things it s gonna force Congress to do an investigation, a complete and thorough investigation, and that means go back all the way to the 650,000 emails of Anthony Weiner and look at [former FBI Director James] Comey and his activities,  King told CNN s Alisyn Camerota.When pressed by Camerota to elaborate farther, King went as far as to paint Comey and the special counsel burdened with the task of investigating Trump s possible Russia ties as the ones that are truly guilty of collusion. What I m saying is this, that the Comey investigation now him picking the special counsel on top of it on its face, appears to be collusion,  King added, however, there s just one small problem with that statement  Special Counsel Robert Mueller wasn t appointed by James Comey, rather by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.This has been a common pattern by the Republican party when dealing with any controversy or scandal involving the President during his six-month tenure in power; just try and distract the media as well as the public from the real issues at hand by trying to create new ones involving Hillary Clinton s campaign.This very technique was what they turned to in May during a Senate hearing that featured testimony from former acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper; rather than focussing on the task at hand, Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruise just spent his time asking Clapper about Clinton s emails. Another Texan Republican Senator, John Coryn, did the exact same thing last month during James Comey s Senate testimony. Even Republican Senator Lindsay Graham from South Carolina recently told Fox News that now that Robert Mueller is investigating President Trump, Congress should ditch their own investigations and resume looking into Clinton s emails.It is a simple fall back plan the GOP keep using and it has been reasonably effective. It seems far easier, not to mention extremely more effective, to draw the attention away from your wrongdoings than try to explain or justify them.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",

        "title": "They Fought And Died To Protect Total STRANGERS From Socialism\u2026Why Young Voters Are Embracing The Same EVIL In America Today",
        "text": "This is a brilliantly written piece by Nick Short of Politically Short on the successful indoctrination our youth. He explains what has led the to rabid support Bernie Sanders, an avowed Socialist and a true disciple of Saul Alinsky, Hillary Clinton In his book The Snapping of the American Mind, David Kupelian asks the following painful question that millions of Americans like myself have pondered for years and will ponder for some time to come as America slowly rips itself apart. Kupelian writes,  How could it be that hundreds of thousands of Americans fought and bled   and many died   on foreign shores to contain an evil and metas-tasizing ideology variously called communism, Marxism, socialism, collectivism, or statism, and yet now, just a few years later, we would gaze up at the pinnacle of power in our own country and behold leaders in thrall to essentially the same core ideology we fought and died to protect strangers from? The answer to this is can be found within the culture itself and more specifically within Americas youth who have seemingly embraced the concept of socialism with little to no understanding of what socialism even is. Yet, like frogs slowly boiling to death in the cesspools that have become our college campuses, our nations youth collectively embrace the ideology that will destroy them while demanding that they be  protected  from opinions that run contrary to their beliefs. For instance, after the outspoken conservative and feminist critic Milo Yiannopoulos gave a speech at Rutgers University the college responded in a way that has become typical in the cesspools that are our academia. Writing in the Rutgers campus newspaper, The Daily Targum, Noa Halff notes:Students and faculty gathered in the Paul Robeson Cultural Center on Busch campus to generate dialogue about Yiannopoulos s visit and the protest that occurred during his lecture. A variety of different organizations and departments were present to listen, answer questions and show support.Representatives from the Rutgers University Police Department, the Office of Violence Prevention and Victim Assistance, Counseling, Alcohol and other Drug Assistance Program and Psychiatric Services and the Bias Prevention and Education Committee were present. Members from the Black Student Union, the Asian American Cultural Center, Center for Latino Arts and Culture, College Student Affairs and many more were also in attendance.In short, this official response to a conservative speaker from what was once one of America s most prestigious universities is a damning indictment of a generation that has been primed for totalitarianism. The fact that this isn t an isolated example is bad, but what s worse is that these very same college students have become champions of government regulated speech so long as the speech being regulated emanates from the right. This is happening while at the same time students are actively discouraged from thinking for themselves. It s a testament to how successful the left has been in capturing our nations schools that today analytical thinking, once the basis of our education system, is virtually gone.It s a symptom of progressivism to see that the supposed  college educated  today have become fierce proponents for government regulated speech, but progressivism itself is not the underlying root cause. The cause itself can be found in the ideology known as liberalism which has been carried to its logical and practical extreme, totalitarianism.As James Burnham explained in his 1964 classic, Suicide of the West,  liberalism has always operated most naturally as a tendency of opposition to the prevailing order, to the status quo, the ancien r gime, the Establishment in general or in its several parts.  Liberalism, continues Burnham,  has always stressed change, reform, the break with encrusted habit whether in the form of old ideas, old customs or old institutions. Thus liberalism has been and continues to be primarily negative in its impact on society.  What is different today though is that liberalism now controls all the powerful institutions of culture, from the media to education and everything in between, while at the same time it faces literally no opposition. The left controls the culture and given that political issues are often decided at the cultural level before they even reach the political realm, the opposition is almost always rendered defenseless. Or in the case of college campuses, the opposition isn t even permitted to make its case.It is outright totalitarianism that is taking place today within American society from the silencing of conservatives on college campuses to forcing Christian business owners to pay excessive fines and face prison sentences for holding true to their beliefs in traditional marriage. The nation has fractured into two separate Americas that continue to drift further and further apart with half the nation seemingly convinced that their rights stem from the government while the other from God. The former seeks not only to control the latter but to see to it that the latter is utterly destroyed. To accomplish this, liberalism functions as all totalitarian movements have functioned in the past, by subjecting individuals to unbearable stress, conflict, and crisis until each is broken. Whether the means to do so are accomplished financially, spiritually, culturally, or psychologically matters little as it always justifies the end. The end of course being the destruction of the will of each and every American so that liberalism can remake the individual from the ashes in which it has destroyed them.Liberalism wants you to snap, it wants to challenge your sanity and destroy your belief system so that it can remold you in its image of dependency. First and foremost though, it must extinguish those institutions in which we hold dear. It is why, since his first day in office, Barack Obama has relentlessly attacked the cultural, moral, and religious institutions that those of us on the right hold dear. Yet, even Obama himself is not solely the one to blame for he represents the logical extreme of liberalism; He is a symptom of the progressive creation and his rise to the pinnacle of power in this nation represented a turning point for the worse as the government has been infused with an ideology of totalitarianism. Take a look at any government agency functioning today and you d be hard pressed to find just one that isn t completely politicized into attacking the ideological opponents of progressivism. In turn, you can do the same exact thing with our culture itself and you ll find the same results. Wherever the progressives are in power, from the government to the culture to the academia and the media, the hatred of Western values dominates.Popular discourse today sees the West in general as being  guilty of genocidal crimes against civilization  for Western values seen through the lens of liberalism represents the  greatest repository of racism, sexism, xenophobia, antisemitism, fascism, and narcissism.  As the Father of the New Left Herbert Marcuse so eloquently put it,  American society is oppressive, evil, and undeserving of loyalty.  With this notion in mind, liberalism places a new emphasis on liberating all men and women from the  evil repression  and  tyrannical values  that Western civilization was built upon. To bring this about, progressives have designed numerous strategies to discredit and smear the values that had forged and sustained the West for the past 2,000 years. The left, no matter what they call them-self today, breeds the ideology the totalitarianism as every single proposed and forced through  reforms  serves to reduce human personality to its most primitive levels and to extinguish the highest, most complex, and  God-like  aspects of human individuality. Even equality itself, while serving as a powerful appeal to the masses with its great promises of  each according to his need , turns out to signify not equality of rights, of opportunities, and of external conditions, but equality of complete uniformity in thought and condition.The total implementation of the principles espoused by liberalism deprives human life of individuality and simultaneously deprives life of its meaning and attraction. America isn t at this point yet, but it is coming as reflected in a generation that is at best negligent and at worst complicit in the march towards totalitarianism. How do I know for certain that this is where we are headed? Because what iv e been calling progressive totalitarianism is what was once called socialism. And following the basic tendency of socialism, liberalism is hostile toward human personality not only as a category, but ultimately to its very existence. In the words of Alexander Solzhenitsyn,  socialism of any type and shade leads to a total destruction of the human spirit and to a leveling of mankind into death. Socialism masquerading as progressivism is really totalitarianism that will inevitably lead to the total destruction of the American spirit and to a leveling of America into death.

        "text": "Donald Trump spent Monday pretty much just making an ass of himself on Twitter. After he attempted to intimidate Sally Yates and tweeted numerous lies about the hearing later in the day, one might assume The Donald would take a break. Instead, he took one of those aforementioned lies and blasted it across the top of his Twitter profile.The header, as you can see, features the whitest room of people you have ever seen all giving a thumbs up and   because he s a narcissist   one of his own quotes, which is a lie: Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is  no evidence  of collusion w/ Russia and Trump. Naturally, Twitter is having a lot of fun with this:Never really believed there was collusion between Trump & Russia.. until he just put that twitter header up.

(@fmanjoo) May 9, 2017Clapper did not in any way, shape or form, confirm that there is  no evidence  of collusion, no matter what The Donald s Twitter banner says. Clapper explained that he was not aware of any evidence demonstrating collusion, but that he was unaware of the FBI investigation into the administration s dealings with Russia until Director James Comey announced its existence publicly in March. That s a far cry from  no evidence. The real story   the one Trump doesn t want you to know   is that Sally Yates confirmed under oath that she warned Donald Trump General Mike Flynn was compromised 18 days before Trump did anything about it. We believed that Gen. Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russian,  Yates said.  To state the obvious, you don t want your national security adviser compromised with the Russians. And she s right.Featured image via screengrab",

Mujumder on Friday, 11 December 2015 Good on her. Doesn t matter if it s a Bible or a Holy Quran, it s just the promise to perform to the best of your ability, swearing on something sacred to you,  a Facebook user said. The problem is that America isn t a Christian nation. It s supposed to accept all religions and be a nation that accepts people regardless of their race, religion, and now sexual orientation. If we don t allow all to be equal and free, then we lose the essence that makes us truly American,  she added. She follows the Constitution   just as Christian judges don t follow the Bible when they pass a verdict, she will not follow the Quran when she rules in a court of law,  a user said in response to those against her induction.Meanwhile, others denounced the fact that she was allowed a to take oath on the Quran instead of the Bible.A Facebook user posted a picture of the Holy Quran burning in flames to express his disagreement, while others took it a step further and posted images where the Quran is used as toilet paper, and messages such as  F**k Islam  and obscene remarks against Muslims.While social media users were arguing about whether she is allowed to take oath on the Quran, no one focused on Carolyn Walker s exceptional work. Here s a glimpse of her skills and achievements:Carolyn received a Juris Doctor from New York Law School. She serves as First Vice-Chair of Brooklyn Community Board 5, Board Chair of The George Walker Jr. Community Coalition, Inc., Board Member of the East New York Restoration Local Development Corporation, and a Member of the 75th Precinct Community Council. She is also a trained mediator with the New York Peace Institute, according to her biography.Via: Free Republic",

        "text": "On this Thanksgiving, I would like to address an open letter to the multimillionaire National Football League players who continue to take a knee when  The Star-Spangled Banner  is played.Dear kneeling brothers,As a proud Army veteran, mom and black American, I thank God that I live in the greatest nation on Earth. For me, Thanksgiving doesn t just come once a year. I m thankful 365 days a year.You make far, far more money than almost all Americans   regardless of race. Kids look up to you as heroes. You appear on TV and in the media.Yet, you keep on protesting   refusing to rise and respect our national anthem and respect the men and women like me who serve or have served in our military.I was willing to die for my country when I put on the Army uniform. And you re not even willing to stand up for a short song? This is too much of a sacrifice for you?One of the many lessons I ve learned along the way is that there is no place on the planet like America. She is not perfect, because we are not perfect. Yet, she is a consummate beacon of light, set upon a hill, for nations who look to her for hope, dignity and direction.You big guys should appreciate that   and pause for a few moments to express your patriotism and love for our great nation when our national anthem is played and our flag flies before thousands of people who have paid good money to see you run around a field chasing a little ball.Let me tell you about me. I m not as big and strong as you, but I stepped forward to join the Army to fight for your right to play games in peace.Weeks before I graduated from the Army s basic training program, I had an epiphany: I could be deployed to war. Would I go? Would I put my life on the line for someone else?It didn t take me long to come to a resounding Yes! If called, I would go.But I gave myself an assignment. If I was going to potentially give life or limb to defend this great country, I would need to know what, exactly, I was defending. I am still learning.One of the lessons I ve learned about America is more of a personal lesson. I am not a victim. My two beautiful black babies are not victims. Black Americans are not victims.We are victors   not so much because of anything we have done, but because of those who came before us. Slaves in chains, treated like farm animals, to be  owned  by others. And after Emancipation, those who endured the humiliation of drinking out of the  dirty  water fountain or taking their child into the  colored  restroom.Those who were spat upon or cursed out solely because they were deemed the  wrong  color. Those who had to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar to be eligible to vote, notwithstanding their college education.Those who were hosed down, billy-clubbed across the head or attacked by trained dogs just because they walked across a bridge.Those who were aroused from their sleep to see hate-filled men covered in white sheets, a cross burning in their front yard and their neighbor calling out for their son.Those who, oftentimes, paid the ultimate sacrifice   not for their own benefit, but for the joy that was set before them.We, today, are the joy that was set before them. And, how do you repay them for their sacrifice to be treated as equal under the law? You have chosen to take a knee.If you followed the rhetoric we hear today, America is not far removed from those Jim Crow days of legalized discrimination against black people.If you closed your eyes and just listened to the blistering speeches coming from Antifa, the Black Lives Matter folks and many politicians, you would think we re not even 40 years removed from slavery itself.The narrative behind  Hands Up, Don t Shoot  perpetuates the storyline that around every street corner there s a police officer waiting to shoot a black man. It is these narratives that have given life to you NFL players kneeling during our national anthem.If there was truth behind these narratives, then I would readily support you black millionaire athletes using your national platform to shine a bright light on the systemic racism against the black community.But we re not living in 1850 or 1950. Racism is certainly not dead, but it s not the powerful monster backed by all the resources of government either. And you guys are not exactly downtrodden, going hungry, being shoved to the back of the bus, or used for target practice by Ku Klux Klansmen dressed up like cops.Allow me to make a few suggestions to you as an alternative to continuing to disrespect our country and flag. If you want to make a real difference that extends beyond getting your picture on a magazine cover, please consider doing the following.First, invest in black urban schools, to help them pay for the educational programs and enhanced learning opportunities that wealthy suburban schools have to help their students succeed.Second, commit to providing mentoring and college scholarships for 20, 10 or even just one child in the inner city, from elementary school through high school and into college. You will change their futures.Third, take $1 million or $2 million   not all of your vast wealth   and invest it into creating jobs, businesses and entrepreneurial internships to help black people achieve the American Dream. Find ways to personally take your millions directly into a distressed community and invest.Fourth, take a family out of the inner city by giving them a mortgage-free home. Consider the ripple effect of good this stand would have on the lives of an entire family for generations to come.Fifth, educate yourselves and then others on what the Democratic Party has done to the black community. I have yet to find an inner city run by conservatives. Yet I see one Democratic politician after another representing some of the most distressed communities. These politicians themselves usually do not live in those distressed communities and often live in expensive homes while their kids attend private schools.Teach yourselves and others to hold elected officials accountable. Be determined to no longer fall prey to their sleight-of-hand manipulations that only serve to distract you from their lack of effort to make real changes in the black community.Doing just one of these things would make an indelible imprint on any community, especially the black community.So instead of taking a knee, take a stand to stomp out poverty by investing in businesses, by creating an environment that promotes family stability, and by fanning the flames of hope, dignity and direction into the lives of some of our most depressed citizens.By the grace of God, I was never called into war during my Army service. I know many others who were. Some did not return whole. So, while I can t play pro football, I have two legs, two arms and a brain that tells me to appreciate and love the United States of America.For all this I am thankful, and I think you should be too.Happy Thanksgiving,Kathy Barnette",

        "text": "Any sane person would think that after Donald Trump decided to freak the world out by threatening a nuclear war with North Korea, then he would at least pretend to be working to keep some semblance of order after creating so much chaos. That s not what happened, though. The former reality show star was caught playing 18 holes of golf with some random dude named Michael Fazio. While the rest of us are on pins and needles because a bloviating windbag wants to have a pissing contest with the North Korean dictator, Trump is hanging out with Mike at the 18th hole.Fazio posted the picture of him and Trump out on a golfing date on Instagram, saying that he had a  fantastic day golfing with #45 @realdonaldtrump at Trump Bedminister [sic] today  and added that they  had an exciting match which came down to the 18th hole.  However, that picture was quickly deleted but not before it was discovered then circulated on Twitter by social media users.After it was posted on Instagram, social media friends of Mike s wrote,  Awesome bro!  while Trump made war noises at North Korea, presumably in between holes.Trump golfed with a random person TODAY.

He claims to be the  Owner/ President at Prime Staffing NYC,  according to his profile.The White House (again) failed to disclose this excursion to the press pool and we can imagine why. A friend of Trump s, Richard Levine, appears to have set up the outing, according to a Washington Post reporter.Yes! A donor to the Donald J.

But according to Trump, he is  working hard  while on his 17-day vacation at his luxury golf course. Of course, he takes breaks now and then to tweet out threats of nuking the world and that s totally normal, right?Read more:Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",

But a Wisconsin lawmaker thinks that women should be forced to get pregnant and give birth.Wisconsin state GOP Rep. Scott Allen made the horrendous remarks while criticizing a bill that would block state employees from covering abortion with their health insurance.Because he doesn t think the bill goes far enough.Seriously.Allen pitched his idea to force women to give birth, and tried to justify his idea by claiming that forcing women to give birth will somehow help the economy. Labor force shortages are tied to population declines. Labor force shortages are a limiting factor in economic growth. Limited economic growth poses a problem when government tries to pay for public services and infrastructure. In spite of this Mr. Speaker, ironically, the Democrats continue their efforts to support the abortion industry. See what he did there? Allen claims that forcing women to give birth against their will is good for the economy. I m sure he would say the same thing about slavery, too.Here s the video via Twitter.Your #saturdaymorning WTF:WI Rep. Scott Allen says women should be made to give birth for the good of the economy.?pic.twitter.com/db01mkLQMl  Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) November 4, 2017Allen is, of course, wrong. The fact is that there are millions of Americans who are currently unemployed. There are more people in this country than there are jobs. More people will not solve the economic problems we face today. And if women are forced to have babies, it will only make the problem worse, especially among teens. Teen girls who get pregnant and have babies are at an economic disadvantage. Many are forced to drop out of school and forgo college, making it more difficult for them to get high-paying jobs.The lack of child care services in this country also makes it difficult for women to work and take care of their children at the same time.The cost of raising children is incredibly expensive now, and most people are struggling to get by as it is. More kids will just add more struggle and stress. This country has a sufficient labor force. The problem is that businesses would rather hire what amounts to slave laborers overseas. Wages are also too low, which prevents most people from sparking economic growth through spending. If all workers can do with the little money they get is pay bills, it leaves very little left to spend at area businesses.In the end, forcing women to have kids is unconstitutional and will do nothing to grow the economy. Forcing big business to pay worker a livable wage, however, will turn the economy into the powerhouse it once was.Featured Image: Screenshot",

Kaine is now going on the record about the effort from within that threatens to distort the results of the race and put a thumb on the scale in Donald Trump s favor.Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) suggested Saturday that some officials at the FBI are  actively working  to support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.[ ]Kaine called the FBI a  leaky sieve  and criticized director James B. Comey for breaking agency protocol by discussing a politically sensitive case so close to an election. He also dismissed former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani s decision to back off claims that he was given advance notice of the FBI s plans to possibly reopen the Clinton investigation.The surprise announcement from the FBI director is a violation of the agency s rules, and it ricocheted through the media in a negative light for Clinton. Follow-up reporting has indicated that many of the emails   if not all of them   found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner s laptop were not even to or from Clinton.The Trump campaign was delighted to have the news to attack Clinton with on the campaign trail, fueling the desire on the right to chant  lock her up,  a dangerous idea that many have compared to the third-world tactics of dictators in banana republics.Subsequent reporting appears to indicate a war roiling the FBI itself, which some conservative forces are attempting to use to prevent Clinton s election, while others oppose such blatant interference in the race.Despite the unprecedented nature of the leaks and the director s actions, the political damage to Clinton does not appear to be significant. Most national polling and analysis of the polls shows a likely win, despite FBI obstruction.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video ",

        "text": "During an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump referred to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as  Pocahontas. In the piece published on Saturday, Dowd says that she asked Trump if Trump had received any negative comments from Republicans about him and Sen. Elizabeth Warren s Twitter feud. Trump responded to the question with a question, saying,  Who, Pocahontas? The jab is a part of a conservative conspiracy theory that alleges that Warren does not actually have the Native American heritage she claims she does. Apparently conservatives are not capable of understanding that a person can have a mixed racial and ethnic background. Which shouldn t be surprising considering Tea Party types aren t capable of understanding that a man named Barack Hussein Obama,isn t automatically a Muslim terrorist sleeper agent sent here to destroy the United States from the inside.Once again, Trump has denigrated a person based on racial lines. When pressed on any issue Trump falls back to posturing as a bully. He ll take any ridiculous notion and just run with it because he knows that his followers will simply laugh it up.However, even the Republican candidate who seems impervious to gaffes and criticism should reconsider accusing someone of inventing an identity after recent reports of Trump s bizarre  John Miller  scandal. The Washington Post s Marc Fisher uncovered audio recordings that show that Trump invented a fictional spokesman for himself named John Miller back in the 1970 s, 80 s and 90 s. During that period, Trump would pretend to be Miller or on occasion  John Barron - and call reporters where  Miller  would say wonderful things about Trump, in an attempt to inflate Trump s personal brand.Trump has denied the allegations, though the Post reports that there is courtroom testimony where Trump himself had admitted to creating the fictional personality.Featured image  (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images)",

        "title": " Trump Has Sent Out His First Email Begging For Money, And It\u2019s Beyond Ludicrous",
        "text": "Ever the self-absorbed, narcissistic candidate, Donald Trump has nevertheless been reduced to doing what every other candidate in any race does   sending out fundraising emails asking for donations. His first email, though, doesn t feel like a sincere attempt at raising money. Instead, it s full of the same language he uses to talk about how great he is, with a little twist thrown in to remind everyone of how rich he is, too.Our three-ring political circus began his very first fundraising email with this: I m going to help make it the most successful introductory fundraising email in modern political history by personally matching every dollar that comes in WITHIN THE NEXT 48 HOURS At most, that will raise $4 million, and only if everything goes exactly as planned, including the number of people he believes will donate the needed dollars. Considering that Ben Carson s failure of a campaign has more cash on hand than he does, this fundraising effort already isn t off to the best of starts. It doesn t seem to matter to him, though, as long as he comes off sounding like the winner we all know he s not: Even without this match, this initial effort would have been the most successful first fundraising email in history. I am certain of this. Oh, please. What a prognosticator he is! He then gets into his typical insulting rant, attacking Hillary Clinton and alluding to this delusion he s got that, once he s president, America will win so much that we ll all be sick of it: The bottom line   Crooked Hillary has been a DISASTER for our country, and we must win against her this fall.Let s make history again, and keep winning, by making this the most successful first fundraising email ever. And if it s not, he ll get up on a stage somewhere, stand behind a podium, and claim he raised ten times the amount of money he actually raised just so he can look successful. For May, his campaign only raised $3 million, compared to the $26 million that Hillary raised. Hillary also has $40 million more in cash than Trump does. Yet he told NBC News,  I understand money better than anybody. Sure he does. So he ll raise $4 million if he s very lucky and claim he raised $40 million. Or at least, that he outraised Hillary even if it s not true. As Slate writer Elliot Hannon said,  It will be interesting to see if the email moves the needle.  At all.Featured image by Branden Camp/Getty Images",

        "text": "Donald Trump just doesn t know how to keep his mouth shut and he continues to receive the mockery he deserves.On Monday night, the Republican nominee accused Hillary Clinton of being to blame for the recent execution of Iranian spy Shahram Amiri, who gave information about Iran s nuclear program to the CIA.Many people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U.S. because of Hillary Clinton s hacked emails.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 8, 2016He directly mentioned Hillary Clinton s email as the reason why Amiri was killed, but the New York Times notes: Among the side players was Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, who said as Mr. Amiri was returning to Iran:  He s free to go. He was free to come. Those decisions are his alone to make. Some of her emails, made public last year during the controversy over her private email server, show that her top foreign policy aide warned her that the story was about to break, but they give little insight into what happened behind the scenes.In short, Amiri chose to return to Iran even though he was warned that doing so could result in his death. Hillary s emails had nothing to do with his demise.But Trump made the accusation anyway and Twitter users were swift in dealing out mockery with the hashtag #ManyPeopleAreSaying. @realDonaldTrump many people are saying you re in NAMBLA https://t.co/iGCvUmoFbw  drew summerbaby (@raisedinthecity) August 8, 2016@realDonaldTrump Many people are saying that you won t release your taxes because they show your donations to the pedophile group NAMBLA.

        "text": "Let s face it, Republicans hate Neil Degrasse Tyson because he is the Obama of science. If the frighteningly intelligent black scientist gets his mitts on their white daughters, they will want to abandon their traditional values and become  ASTROPHYSICISTS.A great example of this is a blatantly racist attack piece put together at the Republican outrage mill Breitbart. In it, the author implies that liberals are racist because they love Tyson. This is followed up immediately by Breitbart using racist tropes of the  lazy black man  to attack him personally while lamenting affirmative action as the only reasons he is on TV.Tyson, whom liberals love because they are racists who can t believe a black guy could be smart enough to be a scientist and so spontaneously ejaculate and soil themselves every time they see him on TV, hasn t published anything of note for years. The advantage of being a celebrity scientist is that you don t actually have to do any science.He didn t get the PhD he was studying for at the University of Texas and had to go elsewhere for his qualification. Obviously, rather than take responsibility for his academic performance, Tyson has blamed racism. In reality, Tyson was playing in bands and appearing on stage instead of completing essays. Typical science PhD students are at any given time either studying, teaching or sleeping.In 2005, he said: I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there s equal opportunity. He of course doesn t address the fact that the only reason Neil deGrasse Tyson is on television at all, given his intellectual shortcomings, is that he is black.Source: BreitbartHere is another famously liberal scientist, who Republicans claim has  intellectual shortcomings,  that is only on tv because of his black skin and a lot of white guilt.image: RedStateQuick fact check. Tyson did not blame his lack of a Ph.D. from UT on racism. He was talking about racism on campus, like when he was stopped 7 times by campus police for walking near the physics building. It s worth noting he was never stopped by campus police walking near the gymnasium. His Ph.D. pursuit ended when the university dissolved his dissertation committee.It took 16 seconds of Google to find that information.Apparently Breitbart is an authority in Astronomy, Physics, and Astrophysics, because they have the ability to sense when a black person has  truly worked hard enough.  in the fields. They also proved their superior authority on the topics mentioned by saying Tyson hasn t published anything of note in years. Tyson has published 13 papers, which is more than Breitbart has done, and last time I checked Breitbart did not do peer-review of any published scientific material.They also hate Tyson because he thinks about something other than Jesus.On this day long ago, a child was born who, by age 30, would transform the world. Happy Birthday Isaac Newton b. Dec 25, 1642  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) December 25, 2014Tyson hasn t published as much work as some others, but there is a context to that. He made a choice to serve the public over himself. Instead of being insulated within the scientific community, he has given up a lot of his legacy in scientific academia in order to bring science to regular people. He went out and made science cool again when Republicans have been trying to make it something to be feared.It s a strange manifestation of birtherism in a way. A black man can t both be smart and popular everywhere except within conservative America. There HAS to be a conspiracy by liberal whites to foist his blackness upon America s heartland.featured image via youtube",

I like people who weren t captured. McCain, a former Navy pilot, spent approximately five-and-half years in a notorious North Vietnamese prison known as the  Hanoi Hilton,  where he was repeatedly tortured. John McCain spent two of those years in solitary confinement.Unfortunately, Donald Trump hasn t mentioned McCain s health yet.

Well, guess what, smart guy? Torture CREATES  radical Islamic terrorists. When President Obama first took office in 2008, one of the first steps he took was to inform the American public about the Republican torture program which had occurred under George Bush, and to put a stop to it:In one of his first acts as president, Obama signed an executive order that banned the use of torture by the CIA And three months later, his administration released Justice Department memos that revealed some of the arguments that Bush administration lawyers used to approve them. (MSNBC)And even he was less than perfect on that count. Generally, this subject is something everyone can agree on: Torture is bad. Torture is inhuman. Torture removes any possibility of moral superiority in conflict. Inflicting torture upon someone under your power and control makes you no better than the enemy. And, furthermore, it doesn t work   unless you re looking for confirmation bias, or looking to feed the xenophobic rage of sadistic bigots here at home.Trump s administration is going to drag us back as a country on every single issue. There has never been a moment, during any of our lifetimes, as important as this one to remember one simple thing: Democracy does not stop at the ballot box. 1.5 million more (and counting) voted for Hillary Clinton. It is a mistake in the system and the result of Republican rigging after the last census that even gave this demagogue public office. And it is our responsibility, for the future of our country, our children, and the world, to stop as much of what he tries to accomplish as is possible.Featured image via video screencapture",

Remember Pakistani, Dr. Shakil Afridi who helped us to locate Osama Bin Laden, and was left behind to fend for himself? Today, Afridi is in solitary confinement at Peshawar Central Prison, a fortified red-brick remnant of Britain s colonial rule that is crammed with more than 2,000 inmates, ranging from petty thieves to Taliban assassins.Sami Kazikhani once risked his life serving alongside U.S. Marines in Afghanistan, but now he, his wife and their young daughter find themselves sleeping in refugee camps and the unfamiliar streets of Europe as they desperately seek a new life in America.Marked for death in his homeland after being outed as a  collaborator  in a dramatic incident at a family wedding, Kazikhani, who was lauded by Marines he once served, was forced to flee last year even while he was applying for safe passage to the U.S. with his wife Yasmiin and infant daughter Roxanna under a special visa program designed for those who served our troops. With tribal elders ordering his death, Kazikhani fled first to Turkey, then made the dangerous trip across the Aegean Sea just weeks ago after being ordered out of Turkey. The trip was horrible,  Kazikhani, 30, told FoxNews.com from Germany, where he and his family are living with thousands of refugees.  We nearly drowned. We saw others who drowned. We were saved three times. Every time we had to jump into the boat with my daughter, I was sad. It made me cry. The only thing I ask is that they don t let me down,  he added.  That they give me the chance to do more for my new home.  Sami KazikhaniOnce in Greece, the family wandered north, sleeping on streets, along railroad tracks and in squalid refugee camps, he said. Everywhere we went, it was no good for us,  Kazikhani said.  Greece, Macedonia, Serbia. They all began to deport Afghans. Sami Kazikani once risked his life serving alongside U.S. Marines in Afghanistan, but now he, his wife and their young daughter find themselves homeless in Europe.Now in Germany, Kazikhani awaits an asylum hearing on Dec. 4 that would allow him to live there, but fears the worst. I feared for my life in Afghanistan, but now I m more afraid of being deported without even knowing what is what,  he said.His supporters say he has more than earned a place in America for himself and his family. All coalition allies offer special visas for interpreters in Iraq and Afghanistan who served their troops, but the U.S. process is fraught with paperwork that can turn bureaucratic snarls into life and death for Afghans accused of being traitors and now actively hunted down by the Taliban, ISIS and Al Qaeda. Everywhere we went; it was no good for us. Greece. Macedonia. Serbia. They all began to deport Afghans,  Kazikani recently said to FoxNews.com. (Aaron and Marion Fleming) I became a translator because I wanted to serve my country and because I was able to speak English,  Kazikhani told FoxNews.com in an interview conducted via Facebook Messenger.  I thought I could also be helpful to the coalition forces as well. But there were many who absolutely did not like the people who worked with NATO,  he said.  Especially interpreters. One former Marine who served shoulder-to-shoulder with Kazikhani is trying to make sure the U.S. pays its debt to Kazikhani. All we are trying to get for him is a verification of employment so we can finish the visa process, but the [U.S.] government is not doing anything,  said former Marine counter-intelligence officer Aaron Fleming, who worked with Kazikhani in Afghanistan and praised his commitment to American troops.Fleming is working with No One Left Behind,, a nonprofit founded by Matt Zeller, a former U.S. Army Intelligence officer who fought to bring to the U.S. a translator who saved his life in Afghanistan. He worries that Kazikhani may not even be safe in refugee camps.Via: FOX News",

        "text": "This morning President Trump called for a meeting of his inner circle in order to figure out how to respond to yesterday s news that a special prosecutor has been appointed by the FBI.Reportedly, he called together Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, Kellyanne Conway, Reince Priebus, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. At the meeting, Mr. Kushner begged the president to go on the attack, pleading with him to  fight back  against special prosecutor and former FBI Director Robert Mueller. Immediately after the meeting, Trump took to Twitter to start trying to discredit Mueller, whining about how unfair it was that his corrupt presidency is being investigated.This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 18, 2017He referred to unnamed  illegal acts  in the Obama administration without clarifying what he might have meant. With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special counsel appointed!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 18, 2017Trump s strategy, as it always is, seems to be to attack everyone else for his incompetence. Unfortunately Mr. Mueller is widely respected by both parties, so Trump may find it hard to make his smears stick.This is unspinnably bad for Trump.Mueller is serious, and a good man.

Reportedly, word has gone out to all Trump surrogates to start discrediting the messenger since they can t attack the message. Whether or not this strategy will work remains to be seen, but administration officials have already gotten their marching orders. Sources say that Sean Spicer, who has been absent from his podium since yesterday, is being briefed extensively about the president s plan for replying to these allegations.

        "text": "FULL OPENING STATEMENT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS  STATEMENT: It was a very strong and passionate statement from a determined Sessions.FULL TRANSCRIPT:Thank you Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Warner for allowing me to publicly appear before the committee today.I appreciate the Committee s critically important efforts to investigate Russian interference with our democratic process. Such interference can never be tolerated and I encourage every effort to get to the bottom of any such allegations.As you know, the Deputy Attorney General has appointed a special counsel to investigate matters related to Russian interference in the 2016 election. I am here today to address several issues that have been specifically raised before this committee, and I appreciate the opportunity to respond to questions as fully as I am able to do so. But as I advised you, Mr. Chairman, and consistent with long-standing Department of Justice practice, I cannot and will not violate my duty to protect confidential communications with the President.Now, let me address some issues directly: I did not have any private meetings nor do I recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel. I did not attend any meetings at that event. Prior to the speech, I attended a reception with my staff that included at least two dozen people and President Trump. Though I do recall several conversations I had during that pre-speech reception, I do not have any recollection of meeting or talking to the Russian Ambassador or any other Russian officials. If any brief interaction occurred in passing with the Russian Ambassador during that reception, I do not remember it. After the speech, I was interviewed by the news media, which had gathered as I remember in a different room, and then I left the hotel.But whether I ever attended a reception where the Russian Ambassador was also present is entirely beside the point of this investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaigns. Let me state this clearly: I have never met with or had any conversations with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign. I was your colleague in this body for 20 years, and the suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for over 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie.Relatedly, there is the assertion that I did not answer Senator Franken s question honestly at my confirmation hearing. That is false. This is how it happened. He asked me a rambling question that included dramatic, new allegations that the United States intelligence community had advised President-elect Trump that  there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump s surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.  I was taken aback by these explosive allegations, which he said were being reported in breaking news that day. I wanted to refute immediately any suggestion that I was a part of such an activity. I replied,  Senator Franken, I m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn t have   did not have communications with the Russians, and I m unable to comment on it. That was the context in which I was asked the question, and in that context, my answer was a fair and correct response to the charge as I understood it. It simply did not occur to me to go further than the context of the question and list any conversations I may have had with Russians in routine situations, as I had with numerous other foreign officials.Please hear me now. It was only in March of this year that a reporter asked my spokesperson whether I had ever met with any Russian officials. This was the first time that question had been posed. On the same day, we provided that reporter with the information related to the meeting I and my staff had held in my Senate office with Ambassador Kislyak, as well as the brief encounter in July after a speech that I had given during the convention in Cleveland, Ohio. I also provided the reporter a list of all 25 foreign ambassador meetings I had held during 2016. In addition, I provided supplemental testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain this. I readily acknowledged these two meetings. Certainly nothing improper occurred.Let me also explain clearly the circumstances of my recusal from the investigation into the Russian interference with the 2016 election. I was sworn in as Attorney General on Thursday, February 9th. The very next day, I met with career Department officials, including a senior ethics official, to discuss some things publicly reported in the press and that might have some bearing on the issue of recusal. From that point, February 10th, until I announced my formal recusal on March 2nd, I was never briefed on any investigative details and did not access information about the investigation; I received only the limited information that the Department s career officials determined was necessary to inform my recusal decision. As such, I have no knowledge about this investigation beyond what has been publicly reported, and I have taken no action with regard to any such investigation. On the date of my formal recusal, my Chief of Staff sent an email to the heads of the relevant departments, including by name to Director Comey of the FBI, to instruct them to inform their staffs of this recusal and to advise them not to brief me or involve me in any such matters. And in fact, they have not. Importantly, I recused myself not because of any asserted wrongdoing on my part during the campaign, but because a Department of Justice regulation, 28 CFR 45.2, required it. That regulation states, in effect, that Department employees should not participate in investigations of a campaign if they have served as a campaign advisor.The scope of my recusal, however, does not and cannot interfere with my ability to oversee the Department of Justice, including the FBI, which has an $8 billion budget and 35,000 employees. I presented to the President my concerns, and those of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, about the ongoing leadership issues at the FBI as stated in my letter recommending the removal of Mr. Comey along with the Deputy Attorney General s memorandum, which have been released publicly by the White House. It is a clear statement of my views. It is absurd, frankly, to suggest that a recusal from a single specific investigation would render an Attorney General unable to manage the leadership of the various Department of Justice law enforcement components that conduct thousands of investigations.Finally, during his testimony, Mr. Comey discussed a conversation he and I had about a meeting Mr. Comey had with the President. I am happy to share with the committee my recollection of the conversation I had with Mr. Comey. Following a routine morning threat briefing, Mr. Comey spoke to me and my Chief of Staff. While he did not provide me with any of the substance of his conversation with the President, Mr. Comey expressed concern about the proper communications protocol with the White House and with the President. I responded to his comment by agreeing that the FBI and Department of Justice needed to be careful to follow Department policies regarding appropriate contacts with the White House. Mr. Comey had served in the Department of Justice for the better part of two decades, and I was confident that Mr. Comey understood and would abide by the Department s well-established rules governing any communications with the White House about ongoing investigations. My comments encouraged him to do just that and indeed, as I understand, he did. Our Department of Justice rules on proper communication between the Department and the White House have been in place for years. Mr. Comey well knew them, I thought, and assumed correctly that he complied with them.I will finish with this. I recused myself from any investigation into the campaigns for President, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations. At all times throughout the course of the campaign, the confirmation process, and since becoming Attorney General, I have dedicated myself to the highest standards.The people of this country expect an honest and transparent government and that is what we are giving them. This President wants to focus on the people of this country to ensure they are treated fairly and kept safe. The Trump agenda is to improve the lives of the American people. I know some have other agendas, but that is his agenda and it is one I share.Importantly, as Attorney General I have a responsibility to enforce the laws of this Nation, to protect this country from its enemies, and to ensure the fair administration of justice. I intend to work every day with our fine team and the superb professionals in the Department of Justice to advance the important work we have to do. These false attacks, the innuendo, and the leaks, you can be sure, will not intimidate me. In fact, these events have only strengthened my resolve to fulfill my duty to reduce crime, and to support our federal, state, and local law enforcement officers who work our streets every day. Just last week, it was reported that overdose deaths in this country are rising faster than ever recorded. The murder rate is up over 10 percent the largest increase since 1968. Together, we are telling the gangs, the cartels, the fraudsters, and the terrorists we are coming after you. Every one of our citizens, no matter who they are or where they live, has the right to be safe in their homes and communities. And I will not be deterred, and I will not allow this great Department to be deterred from its vital mission.How sad that this is happening to a very good man!",

        "title": "MITT ROMNEY TELLS TRUMP How Republicans Win Elections",
        "text": "In case anyone missed it, Romney had the 2012 election handed to him on a sliver platter. Explaining how Trump should win in an interview with one of Obama s closest allies is beyond ridiculous Mitt Romney, the failed 2012 Republican presidential nominee who, alongside running mate Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), lost the election to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, is lecturing 2016 GOP frontrunner Donald Trump on how a Republican can win the White House. I think Donald Trump has said a number of things which are hurtful, and he has said they were childish in some respects, and I think will be potentially problematic either in a primary or in a general election if he were to become the nominee,  Romney said in a rare interview granted to former Obama strategist David Axelrod, according to The Hill newspaper.Romney added that he thinks Trump will  have some challenges if he proceeds to the next stage  and that he thinks  to a degree  Trump s comments and style  do  hurt the GOP as a whole.While Romney previously predicted that Trump won t win the nomination, his change of tone in this Axelrod interview seems to indicate he s now entertaining the possibility of a nominee Donald Trump. Earlier this week, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker a now former 2016 GOP presidential candidate who dropped out of the race, and bashed Trump on his way out noted that he believes Trump has a shot at winning the nomination now. Trump continues to absolutely dominate GOP presidential primary polling, in some cases doubling up second place candidates.Romney lost the election in 2012 after winning the nomination against a fairly weak GOP primary field. He also lost in 2008, failing to win the nomination against Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). Like Romney would four years later, McCain lost the 2008 presidential election to Obama. Even though Romney has lost every presidential election in which he s ever competed, some Republicans still gravitate to him and his inner circle for political advice.Earlier this cycle, Romney met with several candidates, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) the two leading establishment candidates vying for the nomination in New Hampshire. In the interview with Axelrod, Romney spoke very highly of both Rubio and Bush. Via: Breitbart News",

Do you think for one minute that Trump would have gotten where he is if he d not reached out to people and built bridges literally and figuratively? The reason Trump wants to build a literal wall with Mexico is that,  without borders, we don t have a country . We can certainly reach out to others but Trump knows open borders DO NOT WORK! Just take a look at Europe and the EU! What a mess! Trump has said he wants LEGAL IMMIGRATION and doesn t want ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION! He s protecting the people of America and that s putting America first!The problem with Billy Crystal s swipe at Trump is that he isn t practicing what he preaches. Anyone who knows Los Angeles knows that the homes have gates and walls. Well, Billy Crystal has walls and a fence surrounding his home people in glass houses!It was easy to get photos above of the fence and wall around Billy Crystal s home but we can t just walk onto his property uninvited.

Crystal, a friend of The Champ s for more than 40 years, said at the end of his eulogy for the boxer in the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville, Kentucky that Ali  taught us that life is best when you build bridges between people, not walls.  That line Crystal said sounds similar to what Hillary Clinton said during her victory speech on Tuesday.

        "title": " Mississippi Governor Whines About Imaginary Persecution Of Christians In Defense Of Anti-LGBT Law (AUDIO)",
        "text": "In a strong southern drawl that makes his bigotry all the more enraging, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant attempted to defend his state s anti-LGBT law by whining about persecution of Christians, which is something that doesn t exist.When Bryant signed House Bill 1523 into law last month, Republicans made it legal for Christian business owners to discriminate against LGBT people as well as unmarried people who have premarital sex. Basically, as long as these bigoted business owners use religion as a shield they can discriminate against anyone they want.But Bryant defended the law during an appearance on a religious right-wing radio show by openly whining about the so-called persecution of Christians.According to Bryant, Christian business owners are being discriminated against when they are asked to provide service to gay people or atheists or anybody else the owner hates.Of course, that s NOT discrimination at all. Discrimination against a Christian would be if a Muslim business owner refused to do business with a customer simply because of their religious beliefs. Or if a gay cake baker refused to make a cake for a Christian heterosexual couple. If a customer is trying to do business with you, that s not discrimination at all. It s a customer making a transaction in good faith with money, which only helps the business.Nevertheless, Bryant thinks the ACLU is unfairly suing the state because he claims the law is all about preventing imaginary discrimination against Christians and is not about discriminating against LGBT people at all. I mean, they cherry-pick these issues. If they had any integrity at all, they would say,  We understand Mississippi is actually trying to make sure that Christians and people of other faiths are not discriminated against.  It is a nondiscriminatory law. It prevents discrimination against simply that segment of the population that has a deeply held religious view about marriage. Nobody is saying that bigoted Christians can t have an opinion about marriage. But that opinion does not give them the right to refuse service to a gay couple.Despite the fact that Republicans in Mississippi and North Carolina have given business owners a license to bully LGBT people, Bryant complained about alleged bullying and threats from corporations and repeated the conservative myth that transgender protections will allow men to shower in women s locker rooms and use women s bathrooms. We re criticized, we re threatened, we re bullied, we re told by corporations that we re doing the wrong thing?  Bryant said.  Where on earth have we come to simply say,  I do not wish my daughter in her school or in her university to have to have a male in the shower and in the dressing room and in the restrooms. The fact is that in 17 states and over 200 cities that have passed transgender protections there has not been a single instance of a predator using the protections as a defense to commit sexual assault. The only men who gone inside women s bathrooms are the ones the conservative Family Research Council has sent into them in order to scare people into supporting the bigoted laws.Bryant concluded by claiming that Americans support the laws and that they are  common sense  laws. I think the rest of the nation is beginning to wake up and say,  What world do they think we re living in? This is not Hollywood, this is not more liberal areas, this is America, where common sense still prevails. Here s the audio via Right Wing Watch.True common sense is knowing what real discrimination and persecution looks like. And that means Bryant has no clue what the hell he is talking about. These anti-LGBT laws legalize bigotry against a certain group of people under the guise of religious freedom, a freedom that conservatives have abused for too long. And considering the outrage against bigoted states like North Carolina and Mississippi since they passed their bigoted laws, it looks like most Americans damn well have common sense. The common sense to know what hate, discrimination, and bullshit looks like when they see it, or in this case, hear it.Featured image via Wikimedia",

        "title": "Iraqi PM Rebuffs U.S. Decree That \u2018Foreign Shia Militias\u2019 Should Leave Country",
        "text": "Ever since ISIS appeared in Iraq in 2014, both the policies and strategies coming out of Washington have ranged from confused to inept, as politicians and Pentagon officials spar over whether or not to cooperate with various Iranian-affiliated Shia militias and People s Mobilization Units (PMF), led by Hash d  al-Shaabi and Badr Organisation.The driving factor behind Washington s stance is the Israeli Lobby and Gulf state led by Saudi Arabia   who vocally oppose any US cooperation with Shia PMF s in Iraq. This lack of coherency has also helped alienate the Iraq government in Baghdad who appear to be less and less concerned with Washington s sectarian imposition and more concerned with closing-out the ISIS threat in Iraq.This dysfunctional US policy of exclusion in local operational partners on the ground may have helped to prolong the lifespan of ISIS in parts of Iraq. Washington s insistence on playing the sectarian card has led to its inability to openly cooperate with key players   to benefit of ISIS.Notice how the AFP report below categorically refers to Shia militia in Iraq at  Iranian militias    another example of the western mainstream media intentionally skewing language in order to give a false impression that all Shia militias in Iraq are Iranian   which is patently false.This week: US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson drew the short straw again, as Pentagon warhawks send him to Riyadh on another impossible mission AFP reports Iraq on Monday rebuffed a US demand that Iranian militias leave the country, insisting that the paramilitary forces which helped it defeat the Islamic State group consist solely of Iraqi nationals. Nobody has the right to interfere in Iraqi affairs,  the Iraqi cabinet said in a statement, quoting a source close to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. The fighters of the Hashed (al-Shaabi paramilitary units) are Iraqis who are concerned for their country and have sacrificed for its defence and for its people,  it said.On Sunday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson demanded that Iranian militias leave Iraq. Certainly Iranian militias that are in Iraq, now that the fighting against (IS) is coming to a close, those militias need to go home,  Tillerson said. All foreign fighters need to go home,  he said at a press conference in Riyadh.The 60,000-strong Hashed was formed in 2014 after IS seized swathes of northern Iraq, routing government forces.A coalition mostly made up of Iranian-backed militias, it has played a key role in Iraq s successful fightback against the jihadists over the past three years.It answers to Iraq s prime minister as commander-in-chief of the Iraqi armed forces, into which it has been integrated by a parliamentary vote.Tillerson s remarks were also aimed at Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards and their foreign operations wing, the Quds Force, according to a senior US official accompanying him. The position of the Iraqi government and the position of our government is that there should be a single Iraqi security force answerable to the Iraqi state,  the official said on condition of anonymity.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has also hit back at Tillerson s remarks, saying Iran played a crucial role in the fight against IS both in Iraq and Syria. If it wasn t for the sacrifices of the Islamic Republic of Iran  Daesh (IS) would have installed its government in Damascus, Baghdad and (the Iraqi Kurdish regional capital) Arbil by now,  he said.READ MORE IRAQ NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Iraq FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",

It marks a reversal in policy   earlier this month he told Fox News the US should take in more refugees.A migrant crisis has gripped parts of Europe and the US has pledged to take 10,000 refugees from Syria next year.Half a million people have crossed the Mediterranean into Europe in 2015, with the largest number from Syria, where 250,000 people have been killed in a civil war.On Wednesday night, Mr Trump told an audience at Keene High School:  I hear we want to take in 200,000 Syrians. And they could be   listen, they could be Isis [Islamic State]. Describing them as a  200,000-man army , he later added:  I m putting the people on notice that are coming here from Syria as part of this mass migration, that if I win, if I win, they re going back. Asked whether he thought some of the migrants travelling into Europe should be allowed in the US, the business mogul said:  I hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, with what s happening, you have to. He blamed President Barack Obama for the crisis and added:  It s living in hell in Syria. They are living in hell. ",

The latest ones show that at this point in his term Trump is perhaps the least popular president of all time.President Donald Trump s job approval rating has dropped to 37%, while 58% of Americans disapprove of his performance so far as president, new Gallup figures show.Naturally, the poll ends with a plea for money.

On Twitter, he s stopped even trying to find legitimate sources for his claims. Now he exclusively tweets out links to disreputable right-wing conspiracy sites. During a TIME magazine interview, Trump ranted about how he is always right and never wrong.The whole thing is getting a disturbing  Hitler s final days in the bunker  vibe to it.

        "title": " New Analysis Finds SIGNIFICANT Voting Anomalies In Wisconsin \u2013 Recount To Begin Today",
        "text": "It turns out that there are a few new reasons for Wisconsin to proceed with their recount, and they have nothing to do with Jill Stein s recount petition. Yes, she filed the petition and yes, she paid the fee, but the state needed to do this even without Stein s request. A new analysis in the Washington Post discovered significant voting anomalies in several wards.Trump now leads Hillary by just over 22,000 votes in Wisconsin. The WaPo analysis didn t look at precincts or counties   they looked at wards, which are the smallest unit where votes are counted. This helped create a more detailed picture of what s happening there.Walter Mebane, an associate researcher at the Center for Political Studies and a professor of political science and statistics at the University of Michigan, looked at small wards that used optical scanning technology, and found that certain features in the vote tabulations reveal the possibility that these counts were tampered with.For instance, using a method called  last digit diagnostics,  Mebane found that the tabulations he looked at should have last digits that, when averaged together, show a mean of around 4.5. Lower could mean that the counts were manipulated.In the small wards he looked at where optical scanning tech was used, the last digit diagnostics reveal a mean average much lower than 4.5.Another statistic Mebane looked at was how often the last digit of a vote tabulation was zero, or five. If there are no problems, then the mean average of that variable should be around 0.2. Larger could mean someone was sloppy, and smaller could mean votes were manipulated.In these small wards, that number was significantly smaller than .2 for Hillary, meaning that the vote counts show a last digit of zero or five far less often than they should.He also found evidence of something called  signaling  in the tabulations, which is when fraudsters leave a type of trail that more or less claims credit for the fraud. Mebane points out that this is actually a fairly common tactic amongst fraudsters in Russia.Finally, a simple test revealed something called  multimodality,  which could show that someone was receiving fraudulent votes. These small wards exhibited that anomaly, too.None of this is absolute proof of election fraud or vote fraud in Wisconsin, and Mebane is careful to note that. However, it gives credence to the need for a recount, whatever Jill Stein s motivations are. If nothing else, conducting a thorough recount will lend further legitimacy to our democratic process or concretely reveal problems that need to be fixed. It might also serve to weaken Trump s efforts to undermine our democracy by repeatedly crying  FRAUD!! FRAUD EVERYWHERE!! The recount begins today.Featured image by Darren Hauck via Getty Images",

        "text": "Here s how fake news works In an effort to cast President Trump s eldest son, Donald Jr. as a liar, The New York Times boldly accused him of giving two different accounts of his meeting with a Russian lawyers. On July 9, 2017, The New York Times headline read: Donald Trump Jr. s Two Different Explanations for Russian MeetingThe NYT s article attempts to paint Donald Trump Jr. as a liar. Ironically, it was The New York Times who was lying: In less than 24 hours, President Trump s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has given two different explanations for a meeting he held during the 2016 campaign with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer who promised to provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton.Mr. Trump s meeting with that lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was first reported by The New York Times on Saturday. In response, Mr. Trump said the meeting was brief and focused mostly on the issue of adoption.This was Mr. Trump s statement to the news media on Saturday:It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.The New York Times then offered what they said was a different account of Trump Jr. s original story:Mr. Trump s version of the meeting changed Sunday, when three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it told The Times that Mr. Trump met Ms. Veselnitskaya after she promised to provide damaging information on Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Trump acknowledged on Sunday that Ms. Veselnitskaya offered him information on Mrs. Clinton but that her statements  made no sense  and the information was not  meaningful. Finally, at the BOTTOM of the story in small italic print, the NYT s printed a tiny retraction, stating that they misled their readers:Correction: July 9, 2017 An earlier version of this article misquoted a statement by Donald Trump Jr. about a meeting with a Russian lawyer. He said the meeting mostly focused on the topic of adoption, which  was not a campaign issue.  He did not say it was a campaign issue. ",

        "text": "During a segment of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver discussed the issue of voter disenfranchisement. Republicans have everything to gain by making it harder to vote.One of the hot button issues of the day is Republicans  creation of laws that force people to have valid identification when they vote. The genius behind the plan is that it seems so innocent to require people to show identification in order to vote. However, it has been shown that it can be far harder to have all the valid identification that some states are now requiring than one might think. Oliver notes how hard it can be just to get an ID due to the times that ID-issuing offices are closed: And in some parts of the country, the offices that issue IDs are hardly ever open. In 2012, a study found that in Wisconsin, Alabama and Mississippi, fewer than half of all ID-issuing offices in the state are open five days a week. And in Sauk City, Wisconsin the ID office is only open on the fifth Wednesday of every month   and only four months in 2016 even have five Wednesdays,  Oliver says.Those Republicans wish to see vote the least are minority voters, who traditionally back Democratic candidates. That s why during the segment, John Oliver points out how much these anti-democratic schemes disproportionately hurt Black and Latino voters. Studies have shown these restrictions tend to disproportionately impact African-American and Latino voters. In Texas, for instance, experts found that African-American voters were nearly twice as likely to lack voter ID, and Latinos were nearly two and a half times as likely. It s just one of those things that white people seem to be more likely to have, like a sunburn or an Oscar nomination,  says Oliver.The Republican Party is dying due to demographic and ideological changes. Instead of changing their Party s platform, they would rather sink to these pathetic voter disenfranchisement schemes.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot",

        "text": "Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has been going through an existential crisis over the future of his party for a while   especially now that he s backed presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who he doesn t believe will stand a chance against Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.On Thursday, Graham went on MSNBC to share his thoughts on the election and make a prediction that truly showed how depressed Graham has become over the whole thing. The former presidential candidate reluctantly said that Republicans would  probably  lose the 2016 election due to the extremely unlikeable qualities of leading GOP candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.Graham had backed Cruz after ending his own campaign for GOP nomination, clearly because the Texas senator was the only alternative to Trump. Graham made it perfectly clear that the endorsement didn t mean that he suddenly liked Cruz, a man that Graham previously joked about murdering. Not to mention that earlier this year, Graham said that choosing between Trump and Cruz was like being shot or poisoned. What does it really matter? But now, Graham seems like he s accepted the fact that the Democrats have the 2016 race in the bag. During the interview, he said: We can lose in 2016 and probably will. Here s my concern. Trump gets wiped out. Ted, I don t know if he can beat Hillary Clinton or not but at least we ve got a fighting chance.If Trump is the standard-bearer, it s not about 2016, it s about losing the heart and soul of the conservative movement. I m not going to stand behind a guy that gets David Duke s support. You can watch Graham resign all hope in the video below:.@LindseyGrahamSC: We could lose in 2016 and we probably will https://t.co/QJOaVYjtV6  Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) March 24, 2016The reason Graham is feeling so hopeless is that he knows he s right. Both Trump and Cruz are extremely polarizing to voters. Ted Cruz has an uncanny ability to make most people   whether politicians, family members or voting Americans   hate him (which might be linked to the way his face looks). And Trump tends to turn many GOP voters off for his vulgar language and constant flip-flopping on policies. Both of these candidates are an embarrassment to the Republican party, and Graham was dead-on when he said it would take generations  for the GOP to recover from this election cycle.

        "text": "The city s first transgender police officer was kept out of an event at the San Diego LGBT Community Center because she was wearing her uniform.The Transgender Day of Awareness, an annual event to honor those who lost their lives to anti-transgender violence, was held Nov. 17 in the Hillcrest neighborhood. Officer Christine Garcia, who transitioned last year, helped plan the event and was part of the Police Department security detail that watched over a commemorative march down University Avenue. After the march, when Garcia tried to enter the event as a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community, she was asked to leave because her uniform could upset others in attendance. When leaders at the center learned what had happened, they apologized to Garcia and San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman.  We do not wish to ever make any community member feel unwelcome   these officers are valued members of our community,  Delores Jacobs, chief executive officer of the LGBT center, said in a statement. Jacobs said the occurrence was a misunderstanding of the center s existing policy of inclusion, which seeks to acknowledge the concerns that members of the community may have without excluding others. Leaders have reviewed the policy with its staff since the event.  While we need to support those that are uncomfortable and honor their reactions to valid and understandable difficult previous experiences, we also need to explain that  our LGBTQ San Diego police liaisons are a valued part of our community,  Jacobs wrote. Longtime LGBTQ activist, City Commissioner Nicole Murray-Ramirez, said the incident was an outrage.  Any officer, be they gay or straight, should be welcomed into our community center in uniform,  he said.  They protect our community and neighborhoods and make San Diego a better place.Read more: San Diego Tribune",

        "text": "Silly parents you don t get to decide if, or when to talk to your kids about the .03% of the population who consider themselves to be  transgender.  And oh yeah your kids teacher will also inform your child that the gender they re born with doesn t matter, and that they can actually choose the gender they identify with.  Because liberal educators know better than you what s best for your child.The Rocklin Academy school board is facing tough questions from parents concerned over a controversial incident involving transgender discussions inside a kindergarten class. These parents feel betrayed by the school district that they were not notified,  said Karen England with the Capitol Resource Institute.WATCH:The incident happened earlier this summer during the last few days of the academic school year.At Monday night s board meeting, the teacher at the center of the controversy spoke out. With emotions high, she addressed a packed house. I m so proud of my students, it was never my intent to harm any students but to help them through a difficult situation,  she said.The teacher defended her actions to read two children s books about transgenderism including one titled  I am Jazz.  She says the books were given to her by a transgender child going through a transition. The kindergartners came home very confused, about whether or not you can pick your gender, whether or not they really were a boy or a girl,  said England.And many parents say they feel betrayed and blindsided. I want her to hear from me as a parent what her gender identity means to her and our family, not from a book that may be controversial,  a parent said. My daughter came home crying and shaking so afraid she could turn into a boy,  another parent said.The issue was not on the agenda, so parents spoke out during public comment. It s really about the parents being informed and involved and giving us the choice and rights of what s being introduced to our kids, and at what age,  said parent Chelsea McQuistan.Many teachers also spoke out in support of what transpired inside the classroom. They spoke about the importance of teaching students about diversity and having healthy dialogues.Unlike sex education, the topics of gender identity don t require prior parental notice.

        "text": "By Jesse Lee Peterson   President Donald Trump has issued a blunt warning to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel about his city s out-of-control violence:  If the city doesn t fix the horrible carnage going on, I ll send the feds! Trump s words sent shockwaves across the country.But what s wrong with black men that they can t stop the carnage?Those of you who read my columns know that for the past 27 years I have run a nonprofit, BOND, dedicated to  Rebuilding the Family by Rebuilding the Man.  I work with all men, but the primary focus has been to get black men to drop their anger so God can guide them, and they can lead their families in the right way.Men are supposed to represent Jesus Christ on earth; the man is the Christ in the family. But the black community is nearly devoid of men who truly exemplify Christ.Black men were not like this prior to the 1960s. They believed in God and took care of themselves and their families. But after Lyndon B. Johnson signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Democrats seduced blacks away from God and the Republican Party with  programs.  They ve  owned  blacks ever since.Democrats empowered black liberal politicians to run cities like Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta, Baltimore and Memphis. They left these cities in worse shape than when they took office, but the media refused to hold them accountable because of their color and political affiliation.Coleman Young ran Detroit for 20 years. He was racially divisive and allowed the city to be ruined by drugs and crime. A succession of black Democrats followed, including Kwame Kilpatrick, who was sentenced to 28 years in federal prison for mail fraud, wire fraud and racketeering.Dozens of Congressional Black Caucus members have been in Congress for decades and they ve enriched themselves, but they haven t lifted a finger to save their districts.Donald Trump is going to make these people clean up the mess so that decent black people can live in peace. Why couldn t Obama and these black politicians do the same?Liberal blacks argue that it s unfair to expect Obama would stop the violence in  just  eight years. Some said it would be an infringement on freedoms. Yet blacks living in dangerous neighborhoods already feel like prisoners in their own homes.Comedians Conan O Brien, Trevor Noah and Seth Meyers mocked Trump for threatening to send in the feds. But it s no laughing matter for black families trapped in dangerous neighborhoods. These people wouldn t be joking if LGBT or Muslims were being slaughtered.Trump is going to reinstate law and order because he loves all Americans. His father was his role model. When men and women love their fathers, it s like loving God, and they have real love and a desire to help people.Still, many blacks hate Trump even though he is trying to save them. It reminds me of how Jesus Christ made it possible for us to return to the Father, and yet he was hated for that.To help himself and his family, the black man must recognize that Donald Trump and whites aren t the enemy. The black man s anger was first caused by his impatient mother and grandmother who raised him (the father is rarely in the home). When the black man understands this and repents of his anger, he will be set free. He can then help himself, his family and his community.To read the article in its entirety: WND",

        "title": " Totally Blow The Minds Of Tea Partiers With The REAL HISTORY Of The Tea Party Movement",
        "text": "It s been just about seven years since the official founding of the tea party movement. Weird, it seems like much, much longer, but there it is. Seven years since tri-corner hats festooned with tea bags became the national symbol of incoherent, far-right outrage over the ascendancy of an African-American president tasked with lifting the nation out of a devastating Great Recession not of his own making.The tea party emerged as an unofficial sequel to the angry mobs that formed outside various McCain/Palin rallies during the 2008 campaign, complete with viral video messages warning of emerging communism,  Hussein  sleeper-cells and Rev. Jeremiah Wright goddamn-America-hating. A general profile of each group showed considerable overlap: white, Christian, conservative, older Americans who were both shell-shocked by the financial impact of the recession and that the obvious cultural shift taking place in politics, potentially leaving them behind. The president was no longer a twangy, southern good ol  boy or a congenial, plain-spoken old man. This new president would be a northern intellectual   an African-American man with an  exotic  name and an allegedly suspicious background. A flaming cocktail for inciting white conservative fear.Fast forward to the months following the January, 2009 inauguration.Coinciding with congressional debate over the new president s stimulus package, the movement proudly adopted as its namesake the Boston Tea Party, with  tea  carrying the bonus  taxed enough already  acronym. Both meanings contained within the name of the movement were hilariously ironical given how the stimulus would eventually contain, as a total dollar amount, the largest middle class tax cut in American history as well as the fact that the Boston Tea Party was a protest against a corporate tax cut.Feel free to spring this one on your conservative friends. You ll render them speechless.Rewind to 1773 and the passage of the Tea Act, the British law which ultimately sparked the infamous Boston Tea Party.The East India Company, an 18th Century corporation   the McDonald s or Amazon of its era   was in serious financial trouble, and being so closely tied to the economy of Great Britain, it was too big to fail.But rather than bailing out the corporation, King George and Lord North decided that if they just cut the export duty of the company to zero, allowing it to sell directly to the colonies, the East India Company would easily be able to unload its tea to colonial consumers at a discount   boosting sales and rescuing the near-bankrupt mega-corporation. Plus, they reasoned, the colonists would embrace the British monarchy for the cheaper tea, and tensions between the empire and the colonies would be ameliorated, at least temporarily.So in May, 1773, Parliament passed the Tea Act. The long-form subtitle of the act read as follows: An act to allow a drawback of the duties of customs on the exportation of tea to any of his Majesty s colonies or plantations in America; to increase the deposit on bohea tea to be sold at the East India Company s sales; and to empower the commissioners of the treasury to grant licenses to the East India Company to export tea duty-free. Several months later, the East India Company attained the proper clearances and set off to various colonial sea ports with its duty-free tea.To repeat, the rationale for the Tea Act was that lower taxes meant lower prices, which meant the East India Company could sell a hell of a lot more tea. Suffice to say, the smaller colonial tea distributors weren t happy   not to mention smugglers like Samuel Adams  close confidant John Hancock. Colonial retail prices would be severely undercut by the tax-free tea, potentially shoving the smaller importers, and smugglers like Hancock, out of the tea business.It was your basic free market precursor to supply-side Reaganomics in action. In other words, the British government s solution to the East India Company s financial crisis was, in effect, a massive tax cut   a tax cut to zero.Consequently, political activists and, most famously, the Sons of Liberty, proceeded to intimidate and raid   with orders to tar and feather the pilots   any East India tea ship landing at various ports from Philadelphia to Sandy Hook to, naturally, Boston. And later that year, on December 16, 1773, when East India vessels, the Dartmouth, Beaver and Eleanor, were docked in Boston Harbor, the Sons carried out their famous protest, dumping hundreds of crates of tea into the water.All because of a tax cut. Not only that, but the tea party Republicans, while comporting themselves as cheap knock-offs of the Sons of Liberty, have instead embraced the tax-cutting, supply-side policies of the British monarchy.Whoops.Boiled down, it appears as though the tea party movement is in favor of tax cuts, while embracing a historical event that was violently opposed to a massive tax cut. In the interim, the tea party has vocally objected to the notion that something like 47 percent of Americans don t pay federal income taxes. Who is the 47 percent? Forbes broke it down: 17 percent includes students, people with disabilities or illnesses, the long-term unemployed, and other people with very low taxable incomes. Also included would be people like our soldiers in foreign wars who are exempted from paying income taxes while they are on active duty in a war zone. 22 percent of people who did not pay federal income taxes in 2009 are people aged 65 or older who have modest incomes (and do not have earnings). 61 percent are working people who pay payroll taxes but are not paying income taxes.It s important to highlight that these 47 percenters do, in fact, pay state, local, sales and other taxes. So the tea party appears to be in favor of higher taxes for families, seniors and disabled Americans, while also being in favor of lower taxes for the wealthy and corporations, the latter being the exact opposite of the Sons of Liberty. You d think the tea party, which has apparently been  taxed enough already,  would support the idea that nearly half of us don t pay federal income taxes. But they don t. Weirdly.Obviously the tea party s organizers failed to read about history before inappropriately horking the  tea party  moniker, and, indeed, they re more than a little confused about taxes, both modern and historical   the issue upon which the entire movement is based.Whoops again.Anyway, happy seventh anniversary, you magnificent bastards. Hopefully in honor of this occasion, someone will give you the gift that keeps on giving: some high school level history and economics books.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons",

        "text": "Pennsylvania is always one of the most sought-after states in presidential elections, and even though it has been reliably Democratic, Republicans often believe that its 20 electoral votes are within reach. With that in mind, there s almost nothing the GOP won t do to get those votes, including busing in people from out of state in order to intimidate voters   especially minority voters.And now Pennsylvania Republicans are going to court to do just that.The Pennsylvania Republican Party filed a complaint late Friday night asking a federal court to allow out-of-county poll watchers to monitor voting stations on Election Day.Filed on behalf of eight Keystone State voters, the suit alleges that state law restricting poll watchers to the county in which they re registered violates the First Amendment and denies them their right to equal protection under the law.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been muttering for weeks that the election has been  rigged    a conspiracy theory that has coincided with him dropping in almost every national poll, from anywhere from 5 to 11 percent.As a result, many Republican voters have now convinced themselves that there is a massive national operation underway to  steal  the election from Trump. And Trump has told his backers that this effort is coming from cities in swing states, and those cities are largely the main source of votes from black and Latino voters, both of whom are overwhelmingly Democratic.Those voters are more motivated than usual to vote against Trump, because he launched his campaign by describing Mexicans as  criminals  and  rapists  and repeatedly making it seem as if black people only live in urban blight, forever under fire by drug gangs and enduring lives of complete desperation. Success and middle class livelihoods for ethnic minorities simply don t exist in Trump s view of the world.And his party doesn t want them voting.Featured image by Michael Candelori, CC BY 2.0 via Flickr",

Scaramucci called Priebus a  paranoid schizophrenic  in an interview President Trump viewed as inappropriate, according to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Kellyanne Conway would be a perfect choice for President Trump s new communications director. Conway is no stranger to dealing with the press. She is also no pushover. Conway has taken on almost every liberal hack at every leftist network in America, and each time she s walked away holding her head high, as she make her points in an eloquent but no holds barred way.Chris Cuomo of fake news network CNN interviewed Kellyanne Conway on Sunday. You would have thought by now, these hacks at CNN would have figured out they are no match for the brilliant Kellyanne Conway. At the opening of his interview with Conway, Cuomo attempted to convince the few viewers who still watch CNN that President Trump was  very squishy  on his meeting with Vladimir Putin. Kellyanne Conway snapped back in her usual calm but witty way,  Chris, let s back up. So you re saying you used the word squishy which, itself, is unusual to describe the president s state of mind. So somehow that makes people on CNN insist that the president is never going to raise this with Putin? Why are they still in there?  Cuomo responded,  It s not about CNN. It s about what the president said, Kellyanne.  Kellyanne immediately landed a right hook to fake news host Chris Cuomo when she asked him,  Aren t you the least bit reluctant, if not embarrassed that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America? Watch the brilliant exchange here:Conway, currently a counselor to the president, served as Trump s campaign manager and was previously a Republican pollster. She currently is a visible face of the Trump administration through her frequent appearances on cable news and is often relied on by the White House to deliver its message to the press.

There are plenty of real grievances that could be motivating working-class whites Now, I loves me some Krugman but he s missing the super obvious here: White conservatives are angry at a racially unjust economic system that has started to treat white people the same it s always treated black people. It was supposed to benefit them to the detriment of  those  people and it did, decade after decade. White people enjoyed a lifestyle unprecedented in history and managed to deny that life to millions of minorities. But the rich got so greedy that the system is breaking down and now everyone is suffering. Except for the rich, of course.The end result is that they can t attack the system they love without admitting how unjust it was in the first place. What are they going to say?  Hey! Where are all the white jobs?! On top of this frustration is the cold and horrible (for white people) realization that they no longer have total control over the government. With a black president in the White House, there is zero chance of getting through the kind of policies that used to transfer immense amounts of wealth to the white community while leaving the black community out in the cold. Those days are over and with the rapid  browning  of America, they aren t coming back.This leaves us with millions of angry white people betrayed by a system they believed in and supported their entire lives. But to admit that the system was unjust would be to admit that they, white people, benefited at the expense of black people in the first place. Most white people, including liberals, would rather gnaw their arm off to escape this trap. And so they find the most ridiculous and mundane targets for their rage, a rage that should be directed at the system but can t be. It really is that simple.Featured image via AI archives",

        "text": "Our FBI Director has testified once before in regards to the inability to screen Syrian refugees. This time he repeats his concerns before the House Homeland Security Committee in a hearing yesterday. Is anyone listening or is Trey Gowdy so focused on the Hillary hearings on Capitol Hill that he s not paying attention to the effort to forever change America. We are scheduled to bring in 200,000 Muslim refugees that WE CANNOT DO BACKGROUND CHECKS ON. This is insane! The left is hell bent on flooding towns across America with these people which is NOT in the best interests of anyone. Please act to at least call your Congressman to ask questions and demand answers.FBI director James Comey said during a House Committee on Homeland Security hearing on Wednesday that the federal government does not have the ability to conduct thorough background checks on all of the 10,000 Syrian refugees that the Obama administration says will be allowed to come to the U.S. We can only query against that which we have collected,  Comey said in response to a line of questioning from Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson . And so if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but there will be nothing show up because we have no record of them. The Senate hearing on Syrian refugee resettlement took place on October 1, 2015 and is the first such hearing since 9/11. Can you believe that? I watched the entire hearing on CSPAN and couldn t believe the answers given to our Senators about refugee resettlement! The most important clip from the hearing is VERY IMPORTANT! Please watch the clip below where Matthew Emrich (Associate Director Department of Homeland Security->Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate) is hammered by Senator Jeff Sessions on the inability to vet refugees: ",

        "title": "OBAMA GIVES ILLEGAL ALIENS IN FLINT, MI Amnesty So They Can Get Free Sh*t From Taxpayers",
        "text": "Because people who scale border walls and break the law to get into our country deserve the same taxpayer funded benefits as legal citizens right?Caving into the demands of the open borders movement and pro-immigrant Spanish media, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will refrain from enforcing immigration laws in areas of Flint, Michigan affected by a water crisis. The water amnesty is the latest of many reprieves issued by the Obama administration to help illegal immigrants nationwide. Judicial Watch has reported on many of them, including recent hurricane, earthquake, Ebola and  severe weather  amnesties.This one involves the widely reported water situation in Flint, which is located about 66 miles northwest of Detroit. Last year researchers discovered that the city s drinking water was contaminated with lead from decaying old pipes. The problem arose after a switch in 2014 in the city s water source to save money. Soon complaints mounted that the water smelled and looked strange and academic researchers discovered that it was toxic. This all occurred after a 7-1 vote by the Flint City Council to stop buying Detroit water and join a new pipeline project, according to a local news report.Now there s a state of emergency and the feds have stepped in, supplying the area with free bottled water and special filters to install at home until the local water supply is clean. For weeks immigrant rights groups complained that residents had to show identification to receive their free goods from the government and illegal aliens were being left out. National Spanish-language media outlets blasted the Obama administration for discriminating against illegal aliens. One reported that undocumented immigrants weren t getting help for fear of being deported, instead opting to drink contaminated water or pay out of pocket to buy some. Another major Spanish-language newspaper wrote that illegal immigrants and their children suffered lead poisoning and couldn t get clean emergency water because they didn t have identification cards.  When the National Guard went door to door distributing potable water, many were scared to open because they feared the uniformed persons were immigration agents who would deport them,  the paper wrote.The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which claims to combat bigotry and protect civil rights for all, joined the cause expressing  horror  and  indignation  that the government denied undocumented immigrants free water and filters because they couldn t provide a photo ID or Social Security number. In a Spanish-language statement the group s Michigan chapter referred to news reports that Flint-area fire department stations distributing water were requiring identification. But even in places that aren t requiring ID, illegal immigrants are scared to come out and get their potable water out of fear that they will be deported, the ADL stresses in its announcement.  We are calling on the National Guard to order all fire departments and other centers distributing supplies that no one be rejected. Like a good lapdog the Obama administration obliged. This week DHS issued a statement in English and Spanish guaranteeing that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would not conduct enforcement operations at or near locations distributing clean water in Flint or surrounding areas.  Moreover, DHS officials do not and will not pose as individuals providing water-related information or distributing clean water as part of any enforcement activities,  the statement assures. The agency s priority is to support state and local government efforts to distribute clean water, the statement says, adding that DHS stands  ready to assist those in need.  Via: Judicial Watch",

        "text": "George Bush s former CIA director, Michael Hayden, has always had a very uncomfortable position on waterboarding. At times he seems to acknowledge that the technique which, as described by human rights groups, is best summed up as  simulated drowning,  is inhumane and constitutes torture. He recently told Donald Trump (a yuge fan of waterboarding) if he wanted to reinstate the practice that he would have to  bring your own damn bucket  because the CIA  wouldn t go down that road again.  On the other hand, Hayden s tenure as Bush s CIA head meant he oversaw extensive use of the technique on terror suspects. How do you square that round peg? Stunning levels of cognitive dissonance, of course!Hayden was put on the hotseat in an interview with Al Jazeera, in which reporter Mehdi Hasan effortlessly walked through the former intelligence officer s walls of hypocrisy to get at the kernal of truth at the center: Hayden isn t stupid, and he knows that waterboarding is torture.How do you get a man who has spent the last seven years denying he did anything wrong to admit that he did? Flip the question around and ask whether other people should be using waterboarding. Hayden admits in that case it s  completely different. Hayden: I m not giving an answer!Hasan: Okay. If [Syrian] President Assad waterboards Syrian rebels, you will not call that torture?Hayden: Oh, that s completely different.Hasan: Why? So if America does it it s fine, but if Syria does it it s bad.Hayden starts getting very defensive, arguing that Syria wouldn t waterboard safely (there s an oxymoron) and that when the CIA does it, they do it the proper way, which he then describes. Hasan isn t impressed. Good point,  Hasan deadpans.  Series of near drownings, bubbles rising through open full mouth. That is not torture in your view? Hayden concludes by saying the  legal opinion at the time  was no and that America had a right to use the method because they were careful. So for those keeping score at home, the logic is: America s use of waterboarding during the Bush presidency was not torture, but any use of waterboarding by other nations or by a current or future American president is torture. Spoken like a true member of the Bush Administration:  It s never bad when we do it  was their unspoken motto.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Is waterboarding torture?

        "text": "Not that the word  legal  means anything to either one of them Because Hillary Clinton is white and no longer young, a strain of political thought holds that she might lack Barack Obama s inherent appeal to new and minority voters and thus that she won t be able to ride the Democratic party s demographic advantages to easy victory in 2016.Writing for the Washington Examiner, Philip Klein ably sketches the nightmare scenario for liberals.  If Hillary s performance among black voters retreats to more typical Democratic levels,  he writes,  it will hinder her efforts in swing states such as Ohio and Florida, where Democrats need to rack up huge margins in urban areas to make up for their weaknesses in other parts of the states.   It s questionable that young voters will flock to vote at historically high levels for a 69-year-old white woman who has been a national political figure since before many of them were born. The nightmare for conservatives is a complementary scenario in which Clinton holds the Obama coalition together without issue and simultaneously increases Democratic margins among women and whites. In that world, she defeats her opponent by greater margins than Obama defeated John McCain and Mitt Romney. But there s no reason to assume that outcome is any more likely than the one Klein alluded to. And there s also no reason Democrats should tinker with a winning formula. If Clinton can turn out Obama s voters, she will win.The challenge, then, is to make sure Clinton s age and ethnicity don t discourage Obama s youthful, diverse supporters from turning out in November 2016. Fortunately, there s an easy way to make sure that doesn t happen. Clinton simply has to select Barack Obama as her running mate.LOL, you might be thinking. Obama can t be the vice president. That would place him at the top of the line of succession, and the Constitution limits him to two terms. Clinton would end up in court before she ended up in the White House if she pulled something like that.I ll grant that if Democrats nominate Barack Obama to be their vice presidential candidate next year, it would be somewhat controversial. But here Democrats can borrow tactically from the literal-minded conservatives who have seized on syntactic oddities to unravel Obama s domestic agenda. As a purely textual matter, the Constitution merely prohibits Obama from being elected to a third term. It doesn t necessarily prohibit him from actually being president again, should Hillary Clinton no longer be able to serve. And were he on the ticket, Clinton s potential liabilities with Obama loyalists would disappear.As hot takes go, this one is significantly more piping than, say, the idea that Al Gore should challenge Hillary for the nomination. My guru for this argument is Cornell University law professor Michael Dorf, though others have examined the issue, as well.There are three sections of the Constitution that prescribe limits on who can be president and vice president: Article II, the Twelfth Amendment and the Twenty-Second Amendment. While the former two limit who is  eligible  to serve natural born citizens, 35 or older the Twenty-Second Amendment begins  No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice. Whether its adopters intended it or not, the plain language of the Twenty-Second amendment doesn t prohibit a former two-term president from succeeding a sitting president and serving out the remainder of her term. It merely prohibits him from running for a third. By using the term  elected  instead of  eligible,  its authors created a loophole large enough for a Clinton-Obama ticket to coast to victory through. Via: New Republic ",

        "reason": "The article suggests that Barack Obama could be Hillary Clinton's running mate in the 2016 presidential election, despite the fact that Obama had already served two terms as President and was thus ineligible to be elected to the office again. The article's argument relies on a technicality in the Twenty-Second Amendment, which it claims creates a loophole allowing Obama to serve as Vice President and potentially assume the presidency if Clinton were unable to serve. However, this interpretation is highly unlikely and contradicts the common understanding of the amendment's intent. Furthermore, the article's tone and language, including the use of phrases like 'LOL, you might be thinking' and 'As hot takes go, this one is significantly more piping than...', suggest a satirical or humorous intent rather than a genuine news article."

        "text": "Get ready for Donald Trump to throw the worst temper tantrum of his presidency.When you think of Trump, what s the first word that comes to your mind? That s the question that a new Quinnipiac poll asked Americans.Trump has often bragged that he has  the best words,  but this poll makes it clear that Americans had the best words to describe him. And they are words that even Trump can understand. Idiot  is the top word Americans used to answer the poll, followed by  incompetent  and  liar. Americans also used words such as, asshole, unqualified, ignorant, racist, embarrassment, narcissist, bully, arrogant, dishonest, bigot, buffoon, blowhard, clown, and greedy, just to list a few.Adding insult to injury, Trump s approval rating reached a new low in the poll. Only 36 percent approve while 58 percent disapprove.In addition, 61 percent say Trump is not honest and 56 percent say he does not have good leadership skills.The poll also shows that Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the way Trump talks about the media 65 percent to 31 percent. Most, 57 percent, also trust the media more than him to tell the truth, a statistic that will likely send Trump off the deep end.Americans also want Democrats to take back control of the Senate.Overall, it s pretty damn clear that the American people loathe Trump. And even though Trump will try to spin the numbers or use Fox News propaganda to dispute them, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll Tim Malloy says Trump really is out of excuses at this point. There is no way to spin or sugarcoat these sagging numbers,  Malloy said.And this poll was taken long before Trump s embarrassing overseas trip to Poland and the G-20 Summit in Germany, where Trump kissed Putin s ass for two hours and offered to let Russia work on American cyber security despite the fact that Russia has been launching cyber attacks against our nation.So it s likely Americans would use even more negative words to describe Trump if they could pick again.Trump is going to blow a gasket when he learns of this poll and you can bet the hissy fit will be public for all to see because Trump is thin-skinned, which curiously was not a word Americans thought of for the poll. Maybe they will next time.Featured Image: Isaac Brekken/Getty Images",

        "title": "SETH RICH MURDER Has CHILLING SIMILARITIES To Clinton Body Count Victims",
        "text": "Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich s death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation. The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,  said Wheeler.  They haven t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both. When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said,  Absolutely. Yeah. That s confirmed. Wheeler also told us,  I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said,  Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can t share any information with you.  Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don t think it comes from the chief s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].Just as in the Rich case, several of the people who died mysterious deaths were shot spontaneously and in public places, sometimes from behind, sometimes by unknown assailants and often just before they were set to release incriminating evidence concerning the Clintons  activities. In most cases, there were no signs of theft at the crime scenes. And while some of the deaths were ruled suicides, other cases remain a mystery.Rich worked for the Democratic National Committee as a data analyst and reportedly sent more than 44,000 DNC emails to WikiLeaks, including 17,761 attachments, from January 2015 through the end of May 2016. As WND reported, the DNC staffer had been in contact with WikiLeaks Director Gavin MacFadyen, who died just 17 days before the election of lung cancer.Rich was mysteriously shot and killed July 10, 2016. As WND reported, Rich was murdered near his affluent neighborhood in Washington, D.C. He was shot in the back with a handgun at 4:18 a.m. while he walked home, and nothing was taken from him. Rich, who called several people as he later walked home, was talking on the phone with his girlfriend, Kelsey Murka, when he was accosted a block from his house. He was transported to a local hospital and was pronounced dead at 5:57 a.m. If it was a robbery it failed because he still has his watch, he still has his money, he still has his credit cards, still had his phone, so it was a wasted effort except we lost a life,  said Rich s father, Joel, shortly after the bizarre murder.On July 22, just 12 days after Rich s death and days before the Democratic Party Convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks released 20,000 emails from DNC officials.Those leaked emails revealed, among other things, that the DNC tried to tip the scales in favor of Hillary Clinton s campaign and prevent Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders from becoming the party s nominee. The leaks were cited by some Democrats as one explanation for Clinton s election loss. Many accused the Russians of  hacking  and turning the tide for then-GOP candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 election.In one email released by WikiLeaks, Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta said he d like to  make an example  out of the person who leaked the emails. I m definitely for making an example of a suspected leaker whether or not we have any real basis for it,  Podesta wrote on Feb. 22, 2015, according to WikiLeaks.Only days after Rich s murder, Hillary Clinton cited the DNC staffer s death in her speech advocating for more gun control. From Sandy Hook to Orlando to Dallas, and so many other places, these tragedies tear at our soul,  Clinton said in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on July 12.  And so do the incidents that don t even dominate the headlines. Just this past Sunday, a young man, Seth Rich, who worked for the Democratic National Committee to expand voting rights, was shot and killed in his neighborhood in Washington. He was just 27 years old.   Surely we can agree that weapons of war have no place on the streets of America. The bizarre shooting of Rich shares some similarities with other murders listed in WND s exclusive report,  Clinton death list : 33 spine-tingling cases.  Many of the individuals included in the list were shot to death, though some of the deaths were ruled to be suicides. Others were killed in plane crashes, car wrecks and freak accidents.Vince Foster was deputy White House counsel and Hillary s friend and law partner who had connections to the Clintons  Travelgate and Whitewater scandals. In 1993, Foster was found dead in a park with a fatal gunshot wound to his mouth. As WND reported, his suicide was the subject of much speculation and three official investigations.Investigations by the U.S. Park Police, the Department of Justice, the FBI, Congress, Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr concluded Foster s death was a suicide. However, as WND reported in 2003, one of Starr s key investigators challenged the official line, insisting the probe s result was predetermined, only a few plotters were required to engineer the result, the crime scene was altered and that major newspaper editors killed stories by reporters pursuing the truth. The Washington Post reported that federal investigators were not allowed to enter Foster s office after his death, but  White House aides enter[ed] Foster s office shortly after his death, giving rise to speculation that files were removed from his office. In his 2005 book  The Truth about Hillary: What She Knew, When She Knew It, And How Far She ll Go to Become President,  Edward Klein wrote of Hillary s involvement in the effort to remove Foster s files:As WND reported in February 2016, recently discovered evidence unearthed from boxes stored deep in the National Archives lend credence to theories about foul play and cover-up that have been hinted at by at least three books and countless articles.The newest piece to the puzzle was uncovered by two citizen researchers, one of whom was a witness involved in the case from the beginning. What had only been suspicions about missing death-scene photographs are now listed as facts in public documents.The smoking-gun information comes from two documents: a two-page letter of resignation and a 31-page memo both written by Starr s lead prosecutor, Miguel Rodriguez.Rodriguez refers in his letter to photographs showing a wound on Foster s neck   a wound that did not exist according to accounts in Starr s official government report.The obvious questions: How could a suicide victim be found with two wounds   a .38-caliber gunshot into the mouth that exited through his head and another wound on the right side of his neck that one of the paramedics described as a small-caliber bullet hole? And why would the government investigators go to great lengths to cover it up?Jerry Luther Parks: Shot in chest by mysterious gunmanTwo months after Foster died, Jerry Luther Parks   who had been head of security for Bill Clinton s headquarters in Little Rock, Arkansas, during the 1992 presidential campaign and gubernatorial years  was shot through the rear window of his car with a semiautomatic handgun.As WND reported, Jerry Luther Parks was reportedly watching a news bulletin on the death of Foster when he turned from the television and muttered,  I m a dead man. His son, Gary, was with him in the room. It was July 21, 1993. Foster had just been found dead in Fort Marcy Park, about seven miles from the White House, across the Potomac River in Virginia. Foster had been shot through the head, said the bulletin, an apparent suicide.British journalist Ambrose Evans-Pritchard interviewed the Parks family extensively. In  The Secret Life of Bill Clinton,  he reported that Parks was a nervous wreck for the next two months. He packed a gun and drove evasively to shake off any possible pursuers. At one point, Parks told his family that Bill Clinton was  cleaning house  and that he was  next on the list. On Sept. 23, 1993, as Parks was driving to his suburban Little Rock home along the Chenal Parkway, a white Chevrolet Caprice with two men inside drove alongside and peppered Parks  car with semiautomatic gunfire. Parks  car ground to a halt. A man emerged from the white Chevy, fired two rounds into Parks  chest with a 9-mm pistol, then sped off.Several witnesses watched the murder. The killers were never found. As with so many other  Arkancides    the name given to the long list of suspicious deaths among Arkansas associates of the Clintons   Big Media ignored the event.One of the last people to see Foster alive was Linda Tripp, who then worked as a secretary for Foster s boss, White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum. Tripp testified before Kenneth Starr s grand jury on July 28, 1998, that the reason she had leaked Monica Lewinsky s story to Michael Isikoff at Newsweek was that Tripp hoped the spotlight of national publicity might protect her from physical harm. I am afraid of this administration,  Tripp told the grand jury.She continued:  I have what I consider to be well-founded fears of what they are capable of   I had reasons to believe that the Vince Foster tragedy was not depicted accurately under oath by members of the administration   I knew based on personal knowledge, personal observations, that they were lying under oath. So it became very fearful to me that I had information even back then that was dangerous. A juror asked,  But do you have any examples of violence being done by the administration to people who were a threat to them? Tripp named Jerry Parks:  [T]he behavior in the West Wing with senior staff to the president during the time the Jerry Parks [murder report] came over the fax frightened me. He had been killed, she said.The  flurry of activity,  the closed-door meetings and the  hush-hush  atmosphere in the White House all struck her as ominous and frightening. Maybe you had to be there,  said Tripp. [The news of Parks  death] was something they wanted to get out in front of. There was talk that this would be another body to add to the list of 40 bodies or something that were associated with the Clinton administration. At that time, I didn t know what that meant. I have since come to see such a list. After the murder, Gary Parks told a staffer of the New York Observer his father and Vince Foster had investigated Clinton s affairs at Hillary s request. He said that Vince Foster had called up his father, who was working as a private investigator, to look into Clinton s romantic life in about 1980, after Bill Clinton had lost the governor s office following his first term. Parks said Hillary wanted a divorce. It looked like maybe the juggernaut she d believed in, and married, was over. Clinton had by then lost two big races and won two. Till the Comeback Kid   boy is Bill Clinton gutsy   won back the governorship in 1982. But in the early 80s, Parks said, Hillary asked her law partner Vince Foster to prepare a divorce case and Foster called Parks, who compiled a dossier of women s statements. Parks said that Hillary later decided against a divorce, but that his father held on to the dossier. Then in 1993, Parks said, after Vince Foster went to Washington, he demanded the return of the file, and even called Jerry Parks in the days before his, Foster s, death, to demand it. And that two months later his father was murdered, because, Parks said, he had held out on returning the file. (The L.R. police never solved his father s murder, not when I was looking into it a few years afterward.) John Hillyer: Mysterious timing of deathNBC cameraman John Hillyer had been working on an investigation of a drug-smuggling operation in Mena, Arkansas, while Clinton was the state s governor. He also helped with a 30-minute video called  Circle of Power  and  The Clinton Chronicles. As WND reported, video journalist Pat Matrisciana (producer of  The Clinton Chronicles ) began working on the film project in the early 1990s, he didn t realize what he and his cameraman were getting into. I had been contacted by a man named John Hillyer, an NBC cameraman who wanted to tell the real story about what was happening in Arkansas,  he said.When Matrisciana and Hillyer arrived in Arkansas and began interviewing people for the video, the criminality and intrigue were far worse than they had imagined. It was like going into some sort of banana republic that was run by a dictatorship,  he said.  We were followed on a regular basis. Matrisciana set up a  safe house  in an apartment complex in Little Rock where he and other journalists and investigators would meet to discuss stories of drug trafficking in Mena, the murder of two teenage boys there and whether or not Bill Clinton was involved in any of those activities.Hillyer and Matrisciana developed a friendship with Gary Parks, the son of Jerry Luther Parks, a former security chief of Clinton s presidential campaign. According to Matrisciana, Jerry Parks had been hired several years earlier by Foster on behalf of Hillary Clinton to put Bill Clinton under constant surveillance. Gary would go on surveillance stakeouts with his father as Jerry gathered photographic evidence of Clinton visiting with prostitutes, Gennifer Flowers and other women.When Foster s body was found in Fort Marcy Park, Jerry became paranoid that he might also be targeted for murder. He was right. When Jerry was assassinated in his car in September 1993, Gary and Jerry s widow believed it was related to his surveillance of Clinton.Gary Parks regularly stayed at the safe house, but was awakened one night when the door was kicked open by would-be assassins. When he quickly loaded his M-1 carbine, the sound of the bullet being chambered scared off the killers and they fled into the parking lot. Gary went to the window and thought he recognized one of the men as a member of the Gov. Clinton s security staff.On another occasion, when Matrisciana and others were preparing for a radio talk show at the safe house, an investigator scanned the apartment for  bugs  and discovered eight of them.During the course of their investigation, Matrisciana and Hillyer discovered a trail of unsolved murders of people who knew details about the teens  deaths. Others who died mysteriously had inside information on drug ties to the political establishment in Arkansas. On one occasion, Hillyer was planning to conduct an interview with a former official of the Democratic National Committee, but the man never showed up for the interview. Hillyer learned the next day that the man, C. Victor Raiser II, and his son, Montgomery Raiser, had died in a plane crash.Matrisciana and Hillyer were also going to interview a hermit who lived in the mountains near where the teens had been killed. Two days before the scheduled interview, the hermit died.Hillyer started to fear for his own life, telling Matrisciana that he thought they would kill him by making it look like he had a heart attack. After the film was completed, Hillyer went on to other projects and ended up living in Atlanta. In 1996, Matrisciana received a phone call from Hillyer. John told him he had uncovered new information that needed to be put on video, but that they couldn t talk on an unsecured phone. They planned on meeting to discuss the new information, but Hillyer died of a heart attack three days later, on Nov. 29, 1996.Did someone get to Hillyer? Matrisciana doesn t know. Were the hermit and DNC official killed for what they knew? Or were these simply coincidences? Again, Matriciana said he doesn t know, but he did think the deaths were unusual, considering the number of other people who have died under mysterious circumstances in Arkansas.Blacklisted News -On July 3, attorney Shawn Lucas, 38, helped serve the DNC with a lawsuit claiming then-DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz  rigged the primary for Hillary Clinton. The complaint was served before Wasserman Schultz resigned amid the Wikileaks email scandal on July 24.Less than one month after he helped serve the lawsuit, Lucas  girlfriend found him dead in his bathroom.Beverly Ann Fields, chief of staff at the Washington, D.C., Medical Examiner s office, told WND,  The cause and manner of death for decedent [Shawn] Lucas are still pending. Victor Thorn authored four books on the Clintons:  Hillary (and Bill): The Sex Volume,  Hillary (and Bill): The Drugs Volume,   Hillary (and Bill): The Murder Volume  and  Crowning Clinton: Why Hillary Shouldn t Be in the White House.  Thorn reportedly committed suicide with a gun on his 54th birthday on a mountaintop in Pennsylvania.Inquisitr reported that Thorn made several appearances on  The Russell Scott Show  and told the host,  Russell, if I m ever found dead, it was murder. I would never kill myself. As WND reported, Joe Montano, who served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee before Debbie Wasserman Schultz and was an aide to Hillary s running-mate, Tim Kaine, reportedly died of a heart attack after the Wikileaks DNC email dump. Montano was only 47.Former United Nations General Assembly President John Ashe was found dead in His New York home, and the cause of death was reported as a heart attack, as WND reported. But the local Dobbs Ferry police said  his throat had been crushed, presumably by a barbell he dropped while pumping iron. The death by barbell of disgraced U.N. official John Ashe could become a bigger obsession for conspiracy theorists than Vince Foster s 1993 suicide,  the report by Richard Johnson said.It s because Ashe was scheduled to testify in just days with Chinese businessman and co-defendant Ng Lap Seng, who was accused of smuggling $4.5 million into the U.S. and lying that it was to buy casino chips and more.The New York Post said Ng earlier was identified in a 1998 Senate document  as the source of hundreds of thousands of dollars illegally funneled through an Arkansas restaurant owner, Charlie Trie, to the Democratic National Committee during the Clinton administration. One source told me,  Johnson wrote,  During the trial, the prosecutors would have linked Ashe to the Clinton bagman Ng. It would have been very embarrassing. His death was conveniently timed. Gareth Williams, a transatlantic MI6 spy   whose dead body was found naked, padlocked and stuffed in a 32-inch by 19-inch duffel bag that was sitting in his London bathtub   had illegally hacked secret data on Bill Clinton, according to the U.K. Sun. The news site noted,  [H]is death is still one of Britain s most mysterious unsolved cases. Scotland Yard had announced the death as a suicide, saying he locked himself in the bag.But his DNA wasn t found on the lock. There were no palm prints on the edge of his bathtub.For the entire chilling list of people who crossed the Clinton s and ended up dead, go to WND ",

        "text": "No word on when Soros will be put on trial for paying protestors to riot or when Al Sharpton will be charged with inciting the riots with his inflammatory racist rhetoric (All comments in italics are opinions of 100% FED Up!)According to a report  from the U.S. Department of Justice, police responding to race-related protests and riots in Ferguson, Missouri, last summer made a series of missteps, including antagonizing crowds with attack dogs and military-style tactics.Yeah..because the people inciting riots, burning down businesses and threatening anyone who dared to drive through Ferguson are probably pretty credible witnesses when it comes to  missteps  by the Ferguson Police Department. The report, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, is a draft summary of a document the DOJ plans to release in the coming weeks evaluating law enforcement actions. A Justice Department spokesperson said the  after-action assessment   will convey the findings and lessons learned. The report focuses on the tactics of police from Ferguson, St. Louis, St. Louis County, and the Missouri Highway Patrol. All four agencies tried to quell the protests and riots that broke out after a white Ferguson police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, on Aug. 9, 2014. We are always willing to engage in constructive dialogue about best practices,  the St. Louis department said in a statement.  We are interested in the final report to identify what we did well and what we may need to improve upon. How improving number of arrests made for arsonists/rioters who burn down businesses to make a statement? The Justice Department draft report, which covers actions over the 17 days following the shooting, found that police lacked effective protocols, were not adequately trained, struggled with communication and coordination, and made mistakes that sometimes heightened tensions.The use of dogs for crowd control during the Ferguson protests incited fear and anger in the crowd, according to the report, while the use of teargas on people without warning was also a problem.In addition, police were inconsistent in using force and making arrests, and some officers removed their nameplates to evade accountability for their actions, the Justice Department said.The report also criticized police for positioning snipers atop armored vehicles to monitor the crowd through rifle sights, saying the tactic  served only to exacerbate tensions. Yeah because why would the cops in Ferguson be concerned about their own safety when clowns like this are openly walking around advocating for violence against Officer Wilson?It found that law enforcement agencies set a negative tone with the media by initially offering limited public information about Brown s shooting. The report also said police inhibited protesters constitutional right to free speech.In all, the report lists 45 findings along with recommendations for improvements.Via: Reuters",

        "text": "Legendary news anchor Dan Rather just gave us a new name to use when referring to those who deny climate change and facts in general.As we all know, Trump supporters and conservatives now think science and anything the media reports is a hoax. Instead, they live in their own little echo chamber where they will only believe what right-wing media tells them to believe.But Dan Rather has come up with a new name to call them.In a Facebook post, Rather talks about how he once visited the Northwest Passage to report on climate change and how warming temperatures are going to one day melt all of the ice and open it up. Well, the New York Times now reports that temperatures are spiking in the Arctic, and Rather s report is actually happening with his lifetime. I think at this point, we can stop calling them climate change deniers,  Rather wrote.  Reality Deniers is closer to the truth. A few years back, I traveled to the famed Northwest Passage, to report on how climate change might eventually melt the icy blockades which had thwarted explorers for centuries. Well  later  seems to have become much sooner than scientists expected.And the leader of the Reality Deniers is about to take over the White House. Indeed, Donald Trump is the king of denying reality and he apparently intends to pretend that climate change is not real and wants to purge the government of employees who research it, which is why he sent a letter to the Energy Department demanding the names of people who work on climate change and the labs where climate change research is taking place.This is dangerous to our country considering that sea level rise will likely wipe out the coastline if we continue to deny reality and do nothing to prevent these impending disasters.Climate change is real and those who refuse to believe the scientists are going to pay the price for their ignorance.Featured Image: Larry Busacca/Getty Images for IFP",

        "text": "The Los Angeles County School Board has caused an uproar with their right-wing residents because they do not want federal immigration officers inside of schools. The board voted unanimously on Tuesday to direct staff members at any school not to allow ICE agents inside of schools or provide federal authorities with student data without clearance. This move has prompted anti-immigration conservatives to lash out because, apparently, they believe children should be hauled out of their classrooms and arrested.Here are some of the comments under the article on the LA Times Facebook page:   And the comments under the article on the site were not much better:Well, aren t they just chock full of  family values ?!What s even funnier is that these imbeciles obviously have not ever bothered to look into our countries immigration policies because if they had, this isn t new. Traditionally immigration officials have not raided places they have deemed  sensitive  like churches and schools. In 2011, they made this very clear in a memo that stated:This memorandum sets forth Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policy regarding certain enforcement actions by ICE officers and agents at or focused on sensitive locations. This policy is designed to ensure that these enforcement actions do not occur at nor are focused on sensitive locations such as schools and churches The only reason the school board voted on this was to reassure parents, who do not trust the government, that school was safe for their kids. Ever since nationwide immigration sweeps netted more than a hundred undocumented people last month, parents have been even more frightened. According to the LA Times:Although there were no raids in L.A. last month, residents are concerned because the city has a large Central American immigrant population.So to Rodriguez, the resolution is, in part, a symbolic gesture to tell families that  we stand for the safety of our children,  he said.  These are safe spaces. It s sad that the right-wing is so full of hate, that they want kids to be afraid to go to school. And if these kids overcome their fear, they want law enforcement agents with guns to rip these children away from their families because they had the audacity to try to receive an education.

        "text": "There have been many reactions to Donald Trump s Thursday morning Twitter meltdown that led to unbelievably misogynistic and disgusting attacks on one of the show s co-hosts, Mika Brzezinski. People from across the political spectrum have expressed outrage, frustration, and disgust, but perhaps the best reaction came from Seth Meyers, host NBC s Late Night.The first reaction came in a beginning monologue, in which Meyers recounted Trump s tweets for those who somehow missed them, and resulted in a new segment called,  I Can t.  That was literally Meyers  speechless reaction: He just couldn t deal with the bullshit coming from the so-called  president s  Twitter account. Watch that reaction below:Tonight, we introduce a new #LNSM segment responding to Trump s tweet this morning. pic.twitter.com/Diq8LK8Ypx  Late Night (@LateNightSeth) June 29, 2017Later in the segment, Meyers found his voice, and took on Trump s tweets head-on, and actually responded, doing what we re all doing, which is questioning Trump s mental health. During his nightly in-depth segment, A Closer Look, Meyers first talked about Trump s ignorance of his own GOP healthcare bill, and then turned back to the disgusting tweets. He referenced Trump s insistence that he told the Morning Joe hosts he was attacked  No!  when they supposedly wanted to go to his party on New Year s Eve, saying: Said no to what? Your fucking meds?! Watch the entire monologue below:That s the thing. Trump is mentally ill, and his currently our so-called  president,  and thinks he s leader of the Free World (though I think we all know that it s a toss up for that title now between Germany s Angela Merkel, Canada s Justin Trudeau, and France s Emmanuel Macron).It s time for the Republican Party and Americans at large to realize what many of us have been saying since Trump first announced he is running for president: That he is unfit for the office he holds, no matter how much his mouth-breathing, ignorant base and his White House mouthpieces defend him. He is a disgusting, bigoted misogynist who does the nation harm on an hourly basis.Cut the cord, GOP. For once in your miserable, craven lives, put your country before your party, and do something about this man and his nation-destroying, sorry excuse for an  administration. ",

        "text": "Trump mouthpiece Kayleigh McEnany just made the most asinine claim about Mike Pence and got roundly hammered for it on CNN.Unless you ve been hiding in cave over the last decade, you know that Mike Pence is a hateful bigot who thinks gay people are an abomination. He not only tried to legalize discrimination against gay people in Indiana, he supports inhumane conversion therapy and took money away from HIV funding to fund that right-wing bullshit  cure  instead.Angela Rye kicked off the panel discussion about Mike Pence being booed by the audience prior to a performance of  Hamilton  on Broadway. The cast of the play then delivered a thoughtful message to Pence expressing their hope that he learned something.Rye explained that the lead actor is a gay man who is HIV-positive and could not imagine what he felt when the biggest anti-gay bigot in the country walked in to watch the performance.McEnany responded by attacking the  Hollywood elite, the media elite, the political elite  and whined about people calling Trump a racist and homophobe even though Trump is a racist and homophobe.Lemon finally shut her up by getting the discussion back on point, asking her to imagine how gay people feel when Mike Pence discriminates against them. He then pointed out that the  Hamilton  cast was expressing their hope that Pence will treat the LGBT community like human beings. Can you imagine how that feels when Mike Pence, who has rallied and railed against gay people, and tried to shoot down and block gay legislation?  Lemon asked.  He s saying,  I m giving you a chance to give me a chance,  he added in reference to the star of  Hamilton. But then McEnany opened her mouth her spewed a monster lie. Mike Pence loves all people,  she claimed, drawing an emphatic rebuke from Lemon, who is also openly gay. Mike Pence does not love gay people. His record shows that he does not love gay people. Here s the video via YouTube.Make no mistake, Mike Pence is an anti-gay bigot and he will stop at nothing to try and roll back gay rights to the point where they have no rights left. He is hateful and divisive and does not deserve the office he is about to occupy.Featured Image: Screenshot",

        "title": "DEMOCRATS THREATEN KIDS EDUCATION: CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION DEMANDS RAISES AS Chicago Public Schools Run Out Of Money In One Week",
        "text": "It s painful to watch the stupidity and irresponsibility of the Democrats who run the city of Chicago along with Chicago Teachers Union president, Karen Lewis, one of the most hard-core radical, leftist s in the business. It s T-minus one week for Chicago Public Schools.As schools let out for the summer, CPS administrators are scrambling to come up with a more than $600 million teacher pension payment due at the end of the month and the district has zero reserves, according to media reports.The problem is further compounded by a more than $1 billion school budget shortfall for the next fiscal year and an angry teachers union hell bent on securing another raise the district can t afford. With no plan, no money and no where to turn, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel seems to be focused solely on a state bailout as the solution. Springfield has to step up and help in this case, not only as it relates to just the pension payment, (but also) the educational opportunities of our children,  Emanuel said, according to the Chicago Tribune.  Because a payment will then begin to impact   the classroom. And CTU could soon partner with its mortal enemies at City Hall to lobby state lawmakers for more money. Right now, the district needs us,  CTU VP Jesse Sharkey told the news site.  The politics of (Chicago Mayor) Rahm Emanuel going to Springfield are a lot different than the politics of Rahm Emanuel and (CTU President) Karen Lewis going to Springfield. The dire financial situation comes amid a federal investigation into a $20 million no-bid contract to a previous employer of former CPS superintendent Barbara Byrd-Bennett, who resigned this month. It feels like a complete mess,  Better Government Association senior editor Sarah Karp told ABC 7.Karp doesn t think recently elected Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who ran on a platform of fiscal restraint and criticized union influence in Illinois, is receptive to calls for a bailout. He previously suggested that bankruptcy may be the best way out for CPS, ABC 7 reports. Now, Chicago Public Schools does not have somebody in the State House that is a Democrat or is seemingly sympathetic at all to what s going on here,  Karp said.Meanwhile, school ended for the summer on Friday, and principals around the city are left scratching their heads in planning for next school year. Normally you do your planning in the summer and you can t do too much planning without the actual dollar amount,  Coles Language Academy principal Jeff Dase told ABC 7.Dase said many Chicago principals are concerned that the budget turmoil, and looming possibility of layoffs and program cuts, could convince many of the city s teachers to seek jobs elsewhere.The Tribune reports the city council could authorize CPS to increase taxes on residents, or secure some sort of bailout, or negotiate concessions with CTU, but not even all three combined could put the budget back on track. And then there s another $228 million payment coming due for costs related to interest rate swaps on the district s debt.    (E)ven if CPS wins concession from the City Council, state lawmakers and CTU, the district won t be able to close its annual $1 billion budget gap, according to a May 22 report by Ernst & Young, which spent four weeks meeting with school finance officials and analyzing budget documents,  the Tribune reports. The report shows that even with a capital improvement tax, a separate, even-larger property tax increase, additional state aid, increased state funding of teacher pensions, concessions from the CTU and $150 million with of budget cuts, CPS would still face an annual $350 million shortfall. Next June s teacher pension payment is set to balloon to $700 million. Via: EAG News",

        "text": "Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThe 2016 Democratic National Convention was the latest in a long line of sordid political productions  It was a tough week for the Clinton  change makers  as Bernie Sanders delegates staged a mass walkout after a series of email leaks disclosed that a Clinton lawyer gave the DNC strategy advice on how to sideline the Sanders campaign.There were also claims of white noise machines used to quell any anti-Clinton dissent inside the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. Help Wanted: Actors Needed Putting aside the fact that today s US presidential conventions have turned into celebrity show business promotional events (pop star Katie Perry, Ted Danson, and even British actor Orlando Bloom et all), there s another more disturbing controversy emerging   this time over a Craigslist ad stating that,  actors were needed for a national convention    prompting critics to suggest empty seats had to be filled prior to the end of the convention and that the July 27th ad was at the behest of the DNC.Whether or not all or some of the claims above are fully accurate, 2016 s DNC was unquestionably a contentious affair filled with a heavy dose of identity politics.In fact, the star-studded event conjured the bizarre Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting from just over a month ago by having Christine Leinonen speak at the convention, a former Michigan State Police trooper/Florida Attorney turned Wheel of Fortune hopeful, and mother of Christopher (Drew) Leinonen, an apparent victim of America s largest mass shooting. Here s Australia s Peekay Truth on YouTube examining the phenomena surrounding Christine Leinonen Interestingly, Chris Leinonen s pro gun father Mark Bando, a former patrol officer for the city of Detroit PD from 1974-99, did not speak at the convention on behalf of his son.Additionally at Leinonen s speech at the DNC, she was accompanied by Pulse nightclub shooting survivor Brandon Wolf, who just happens to be a former runner-up on Bravo TV s The Kandi Factory. We ve noted before, the many strange Hollywood links to the Pulse shooting, including the apparent actor-cum-shooter Omar Mateen.Below is a YouTube video from the user Run2Christ HD, which investigates the many casting connections linked to Brandon Wolf, while also disclosing that one of the Pulse nightclub founders, Ron Legler, is the president of the Florida Theatrical Association and a booking agent for national touring broadway productions. Some of FTA s productions include The Lion King, Chicago and The Phantom of the Opera.Here s Brandon Wolf ready for his close-up Here s a screen shot of Ron Legler s professional background Here at 21WIRE, we examined much of the anomalies associated with the Orlando shooting, an event that failed to account for any shootings said to have taken place within the nightclub, as the FBI s own transcript made no mention of individuals being shot inside the club.If you remember, according to FOX analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano plainly states that all of the Pulse nightclub victims met their fate when Orlando police entered the building Here s a You Tube video montage from Educate Yourself, that displays some of the strange behaviour exhibited by Christine Leinonen More DNC discussion from Zero Hedge below DNC NIGHTMARE?    Empty seats observed during roll call at the DNC. (Image Source: fellowshipofminds)Zero HedgeDid The DNC Hire Actors (At Below Minimum Wage) To Work At The Convention?Following the exposure of a fake Trump job advertisement designed by The DNC to embarrass Trump, it is interesting that a Craigslist ad calling for  Actors Needed for National Convention  has surfaced Whether the ad is real or fake is unclear, but the text suggests below minimum wage compensation (7-plus hours work for $50) and the number of walkouts from the Convention indicates perhaps a need for cheering happy seat-fillers SNOOZEFEST    Bill Clinton nods off during Hillary s vacuous speech. (Image Source: YouTube)Actors Needed For National Convention (Philadelphia) compensation: $50.00 Looking for 700 people to be utilized as actors during the National Convention. We currently have a number of empty seats that will need to be filled as we are currently removing a number of people and need to refill their seats for the remainder of the conference. You will be paid $50.00 each night for the remainder of the convention. You will be required to cheer at all times and will be asked to dress properly and possibly wear some promotional material.Which makes sense if one looks at the following shocking video from film director, Josh Fox, best known for his Oscar-nominated anti-fracking documentary Gasland, captured inside the DNC As DailyWire.com reports, Fox tells the camera   This is amazing, this place is empty. There is nobody left in here. I mean this whole stadium, look at this,  as he pans his cellphone to show the lack of cheering Dems.He continues in disbelief, adding,  This is not voter enthusiasm . I can t believe my eyes. I ve never seen anything like this. This is the primetime of the Democratic National Convention right after the nomination of Hillary Clinton and this place is emptied out like crazy. I m stunned. This is insane. The whole California delegation is pretty much gone,  he adds.  I mean this has got to be something very worrisome for the Democrats. Voter enthusiasm wins elections.

        "text": "If Clinton and Lynch just talked about grandkids then why is this such a top secret transcript? This is troubling because it portends to what we ve known all along Bill Clinton was meeting with Lynch to fight Hillary s battle. They won t reveal it because it would implicate so many people in government Are we right?A citizen researcher from Florida is attempting to have the recording of the infamous Bill Clinton/Loretta Lynch tarmac tape released to the public, but apparently, the National Security Agency claims they won t release it due to  national security. The man researching and seeking to have the tape released is Florida orthodontist Larry Kawa. You may remember him because of Judicial Watch s filing of a lawsuit on his behalf to obtain a week s worth of Hillary Clinton s emails regarding Benghazi.It s being reported now that the NSA has declared the recording of the conversation that took place between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch in Phoenix, Arizona on June 27, 2016.Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act request in March of this year to obtain the following:Any and all records and/or transcripts of a meeting held between Attorney General Loretta lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all records of communication sent to or from officials in the Office of the Attorney General regarding the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all records of communication sent to or from officials in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General regarding the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all references to the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton contained in day planners, calendars and schedules in the Office of theAttorney General. This brings us to Kawa. In an article at Big League Politics, Patrick Howley writes:The National Security Agency (NSA) blocked the release of a purported tape of Bill Clinton and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch s private airplane talk with a rare legal justification used to protect top national security secrets.The NSA s block of the release of this information   citing one of President Obama s executive orders   undercuts Hillary Clinton s claim that her husband and Lynch had a  purely social  conversation about grandkids and golf on June 27, 2016, two weeks before Lynch dropped the Department of Justice investigation into Hillary Clinton s email scandal.Read more: Freedom Outpost",

Pulling a firearm just because another voter does not share your choice of candidate is uncivilized and damages the democratic process.

But Waters resigned today after it was revealed that she has dual citizenship in Australia and Canada, a breach of Australia s constitution for sitting senators.Waters, a member of Australia s Green Party, became an international sensation in May when she breastfed her two-month old daughter in Australia s parliament.

Australia s constitution forbids anyone with dual citizenship from serving as a senator. Waters, who says she was unaware that she held citizenship in Canada, was elected in 2010. I was devastated to learn that because of 70-year-old Canadian laws I had been a dual citizen from birth, and that Canadian law changed a week after I was born and required me to have actively renounced Canadian citizenship,  Waters said at a press conference today.

Thousands of Republicans will either refuse to vote for him or vote for Democrats to keep Donald Trump from taking over their party and ultimately the Oval Office. But Mr. Trump s campaign, along with Senator Ted Cruz who is also despised by many of his Republican colleagues and supporters of the party, have pulled Republicans far to the right, leaving moderate Republicans with nowhere to turn but the Democratic Party.Republicans currently have a majority in both the House and the Senate. Congress has been in gridlock since they took over. The GOP majority has consistently refused to do their jobs; they are more focused on obstructing President Obama than working with Democrats to solve the pressing problems facing our nation. This November, those do-nothing Republicans will pay the price by losing elections across the country, in addition to the presidential election.Republicans love to do nothing, so the Democrats will help them achieve those ambitions of doing nothing by no longer allowing them to be employed in Congress. Despite the pressing and timely concerns posed by the threat of climate change, Republicans refuse to acknowledge its existence and do nothing. When religious nutjob Kim Davis refused to do her job as a county clerk charged with issuing marriage licenses in Kentucky, Republicans applauded her propensity for not doing her job. When Paul Ryan became Speaker of the House, Republicans forced him to promise to not do anything on immigration reform, and bow to the party leaders  wishes for Congress to continue to do nothing better than before.Despite mass shootings occurring all over the country on a regular basis, the Republican Party has refused to take any action on gun control or mental health issues.  Every meaningful proposal or reform that is introduced into Songress is met with staunch resistance from the Republican Party, who refuses to act to help solve or mitigate any of the issues facing the country. With the Republican majority gone, Democrats can finally start solving some of the country s problems.Featured image via Flickr",

        "text": "For months Donald Trump and his top staffers have sworn that no one in the campaign had contact with the Russian government while it was in the middle of engaging in a cyber attack against Democrats. Trump s new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, even testified under oath that he had not spoke to Russian officials while working on Trump s campaign.And that lie just got exposed.Now high ranking Democrats including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee Elijah Cummings have both called on Sessions to immediately step down. Pelosi s statement was a scorched earth condemnation of Sessions, Trump, and the entire administration which seems hell-bent on covering up its connections to Russia no matter what. Jeff Sessions lied under oath during his confirmation hearing before the Senate. Under penalty of perjury, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee,  I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.  We know that statement is false.Attorney General Sessions has never had the credibility to oversee the FBI investigation of senior Trump officials  ties to the Russians. This is why Democrats have consistently called for Sessions to recuse himself from any oversight of the investigation.Now, after lying under oath about his own communications with the Russians, the Attorney General must resign. There must be an independent, bipartisan, outside commission to investigate the Trump political, personal, and financial connection to the Russians. Cummings was equally forceful in calling for Sessions to resign, citing the fact that Michael Flynn, Trump s disgraced former National Security Advisor, had already resigned for a similar offense and Sessions  was that much worse because he kept quiet about it even after that scandal.Sessions should have the self-respect to resign, because he may be also be facing a conviction. At least one former White House ethics lawyer has already stated that he believes what Sessions did could easily send him to prison.Misleading the Senate in sworn testimony about one own contacts with the Russians is a good way to go to jail https://t.co/qH0s6sTMJ9  Richard W. Painter (@RWPUSA) March 2, 2017As Pelosi noted, Sessions  credibility was already zero and now it s under water.

Cummings and demand Sessions leave in disgrace.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Image",

        "title": " Poll Shows Hillary Leading Trump With This Surprising Demographic For The First Time Ever",
        "text": "Until today, not one national poll had Clinton leading with male voters. Some have gotten close, but Donald Trump has always managed to lock it up. The gender gap that we have seen the last several elections was looking like a repeat for 2016.But now a new poll released the day of the third and final presidential debate shows Clinton now   for the first time   is leading with men. The newest poll from Bloomberg Politics shows Clinton edging out Trump by 2 points with men (46 to 44) and 9 points overall (47-38).The poll was conducted from October 14-17 with responses from 1,006 likely voters.So a week after the game-changing audio tape was leaked   in which Trump admits to sexually assaulting women   men have started to turn against the Republican nominee, and for good reason.Clinton is already gaining in Republican strongholds   white, college educated women, Cuban-Americans, young Republicans, Vietnamese-Americans, and now men. Such gains have turned traditionally red states like Arizona, Georgia and Texas into reachable victories for Democrats.With Trump under-performing Romney in key swing states (and red states), Trump cannot afford to lose his key voting demographics, but the damage from the tape and the accusations of sexual assault have hurt him tremendously.Republican men have distanced themselves from Trump after the revelations were leaked, invoking their wives and daughters and granddaughters as reasons they cannot support the GOP nominee. It s not clear if the shift in male support for Clinton comes from Independent or Republican defectors, but the numbers are slowly inching Clinton s way.With less than 20 days until election day, Trump is going to have to pivot hard if he hopes of bringing back all the defectors into his camp. With early voting already underway, in which millions have already cast their ballots, the window of opportunity may have passed.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",

        "text": "The Republican National Convention starts this coming Monday, and things are not looking good for the GOP s biggest event for the next four years. The problem, of course, is their standard-bearer, Donald Trump. Many prominent Republicans are staying as far away from the convention as possible, they are still about $6 million short of actually paying for the whole thing, and to top it all off, it seems that RNC Chair Reince Priebus still can t get the #NeverTrump delegates to fall in line behind Trump. Now, former presidential candidate Jeb Bush has become the latest to go on record saying that he is most definitely #NeverTrump.On Friday, Bush took his anti-Trump sentiments to the Washington Post, where he said that Trump had tapped into anger and frustration in Americans: They have given rise to the success of a candidate who continues to grotesquely manipulate the deeply felt anger of many Americans. Trump s abrasive, Know Nothing-like nativist rhetoric has blocked out sober discourse about how to tackle America s big challenges. Bush then continued to slam Trump throughout the article, and cautioned fellow Republican politicians about the tone of Trump s campaign and the stain he was putting upon the party. He then went on to beg them to reintroduce civility, ideas and optimism back into politics. Let s find ways to campaign and govern inclusively. Let s find ways to ease the angst and fear of people, without cynically feeding it. He then went on to say that he would not be voting for either Trump or Clinton, but might go for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson: I haven t decided how I ll vote in November   whether I ll support the Libertarian ticket or write in a candidate   but I do know there are a lot of things Republicans can do in the coming months to lay the groundwork for rebuilding our party and the foundation for a true conservative renewal in our country. The only sort-of compliment Bush had for Trump was his choice to choose Indiana Gov. Mike Pence for the #2 spot on the GOP ticket, and it came via Twitter:Mike Pence is a good man. He will add value to the ticket.  Jeb Bush (@JebBush) July 16, 2016Well, that s something I guess. At the end of the day, good on Jeb Bush and the other #NeverTrump Republicans. We don t agree on much, but we do agree that Donald Trump is dangerously unfit to be president of the United States.Featured image via Michael Vadon/Wikimedia",

        "text": "Reince Priebus, Donald Trump s chief of staff, is now facing a misconduct complaint related to his decision to interfere with the FBI s investigation of Russia.Attorney J. Whitfield Larrabee filed the complaint with the Wisconsin Office of Lawyer Regulation regarding Priebus  attempt to persuade the FBI to favor Trump in their investigation of the Russian scandal that has plagued the administration.The complaint reads:There is probable cause to charge attorney Reince Priebus ( Priebus ) with violations of Wisconsin s Rules of Professional Conduct for Attorneys, Supreme Court Rules, Chapter 20. The violations of these rules relate to Priebus  corrupt attempt to influence investigations by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) into criminal activity involving associates of Donald J. Trump ( Trump ) and Russian government officials. .It is a violation of SCR 20:8.4 (b) for a lawyer to  commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.  It is a violation of SCR 20:8.4 (c)  to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.  There is probable cause to charge Priebus with such serious violations of these particular ethical requirements that it will be necessary and appropriate to revoke his license to practice of law if the charges are established.Larrabee explained that he  filed the complaint as a concerned citizen and attorney because I was alarmed that Reince Priebus would communicate with the FBI about a pending investigation of the collusion between Trump campaign officials and senior Russian intelligence officials. Communications by Priebus with the FBI about a pending investigation of this sort severely violates the integrity of the investigation and is a blatant form of corruption. While it isn t really likely that this complaint will bring about any real repercussions for Priebus, it does send a very important message: even if Republicans won t stand up to Trump s administration and hold them accountable, the citizens of the United States will.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",

        "text": "Seldom in life do you come across someone so dumb that they literally make you cringe, but alas, Sarah Palin is one of those people. And if her general presence doesn t make you cringe then hearing her speak will, but if that still doesn t do it to you, just wait until you hear what she has to say.In her latest bout of idiocy, she took to her favorite pastime of posting on Facebook for her imbecilic following. What is it that she posted this time? Well, Palin posted an image of her new BFF Donald Trump with a quote by none other than Mahatma Gandhi. Yes, really, that Gandhi.This is the quote she used: First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ <span class=\"mceItemHidden\" data-mce-bogus=\"1\"><span></span>&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(function(d, s, id) {  var js, <span class=\"mceItemHidden\" data-mce-bogus=\"1\"><span class=\"hiddenSpellError\" pre=\"\" data-mce-bogus=\"1\">fjs</span></span> = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;version=v2.3\";  <span class=\"hiddenSpellError\" pre=\"\" data-mce-bogus=\"1\">fjs</span>.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', '<span class=\"hiddenSpellError\" pre=\"\" data-mce-bogus=\"1\">facebook-jssdk</span>')); // ]]&gt;Posted by Sarah Palin on Wednesday, February 24, 2016This quote has long been used by civil rights pioneers in their quest for justice and equality. For Palin to equate the bombastic and racist Trump to that of not only Gandhi, but those who have long been fighting for justice, is not only inaccurate, but outright disgusting. Trump is exactly opposite of everything Gandhi stood for.She s trying to say that no one took Trump seriously and now that he s the likely GOP nominee he may go on to win. However, what she doesn t get, is the fact that Trump, as well as herself, are still jokes not to be taken seriously. Their brand of politics is toxic not only to the GOP, but to the nation and the world. Her idiocy really knows no bounds, and by equating Trump to Gandhi she proves, yet again, how truly stupid she is.Featured image: Flickr",

        "text": "Fox News host Eric Bolling had recently been filling in for his colleague Bill O Reilly on The O Reilly Factor, and he was in no way prepared for the chaos that erupted when one of his guests called Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton a  bigot. The discussion began by bringing up Donald Trump s recent comments about Clinton s polices being  bigoted  and it immediately set off Bolling s guests, who spent the majority of the segment at each other s throats despite Bolling s attempts to restore a calm discussion.Civil rights attorney Leo Terrell had hit the nail right on the head when he commented that Trump had no business calling someone else s policies  bigoted.  He said: Eric, Donald Trump doesn t know the definition of the word  bigot . You don t hear Republicans on Capitol Hill supporting Donald Trump s definition of the term  bigoted  as it applies to Hillary Clinton. It doesn t make sense, it s inexplicable. Terrell also defended Clinton, stating that when she d called out Trump s racism in a speech, her argument had been  fact-based    and that s when conservative Horace Cooper lost it and countered that Clinton s speech had been a  litany of lies. What happened next was insanity. Cooper, an African American legal commentator, said that the black community would be much better off under racist Trump. He said, It s good  that someone is finally telling the truth! Somebody needed to stand up and explain that the policies that the left and progressives have been pushing are bigoted because they don t assume there is any possibility for improvement for blacks. Terrell couldn t believe his ears and told Cooper,  You should be ashamed of yourself.  Then he asked Cooper again to answer Bolling s question,  Is Hillary Clinton a bigot? Cooper said,  absolutely,  and the two men exchanged heated words as Bolling tried to intervene. Shortly after the men got into a shouting match over Trump s popularity with the racist  alt-right  and support from the KKK, Terrell repeatedly told Cooper that he should be  ashamed  for his pro-Trump views.You can watch this chaotic discussion below: Featured image via screen capture",

        "text": "Hillary Clinton delivered an amazing speech on Thursday night and the DNC Convention was a unifying success, so of course Donald Trump threw a temper tantrum about it. Our country s motto is e pluribus unum: out of many, we are one. Will we stay true to that motto?  the former Secretary of State asked Americans before going after Donald Trump s agenda of fear and division. Well, we heard Donald Trump s answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us   from the rest of the world, and from each other.He s betting that the perils of today s world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He s taken the Republican Party a long way  from  Morning in America  to  Midnight in America.  He wants us to fear the future and fear each other.Well, a great Democratic President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than eighty years ago, during a much more perilous time.  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Hillary went on to slam Trump for claiming that he alone can fix America and blasted him for claiming that he will put America first, which led to one of the best passages of the night. He also talks a big game about putting America First. Please explain to me what part of America First leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin.Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again   well, he could start by actually making things in America again. The Democratic nominee also questioned Trump s temperament to be president, which also led to one of the best lines of the night. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he s gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he s challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. Indeed, and Trump not only lost his cool during Clinton s speech, he clearly went to bed enraged because he continued throwing a temper tantrum on Friday morning with a series of tweets attacking just about anyone, including the media, Michael Bloomberg, and General John Allen. But he began his temper tantrum on Thursday night by whining about Hillary not saying certain magic words that Trump believes will defeat ISIS.Hillary s refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016And then he threw a broader tantrum.Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Hillary s vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016Hillary s wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016It should be pointed out that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were not  Hillary s wars.  They were George W. Bush s wars. No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton   corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016Then Trump picked up where he left off and continued his hissy fit.The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and  forgot  to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD #NeverHillary  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016  Little  Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn t get 10% of the vote   they would run him out of town! #NeverHillary  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Crooked Hillary said that I  couldn t handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign.  Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016Again, this is who the Republican Party actually thinks is qualified to be the leader of the free world. How will he lead the nation when is he is too busy lashing out on Twitter at anyone who makes even the slightest criticism against him? And keep in mind that Trump only has Twitter to attack people with. As president, he would have the military, drones, and nuclear weapons at his disposal. How can anyone feel safe with Trump as president when he has such a thin skin that he could start a war at any time just because another nation insulted him?Featured Image: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images",

        "text": "Donald Trump likely caused a diplomatic crisis with China when he decided he would talk to the president of Taiwan on Friday. The move left political observers scratching their heads and wondering how he could have possibly thought this was a good idea. The answer is simple. It s the same reason Trump does everything   he thinks he can get something out of it. In this case, another luxury resort.In 1979, the United States severed all diplomatic ties with Taiwan and adopted a One China stance. Since that time, no president (or president-elect) has spoken with the country s president. As far as China is concerned, Taiwan is part of China. Trump s phone call with Tsai Ying-wen, the president of Taiwan,  is likely to infuriate Beijing which regards the island as a renegade province. So why on earth would Trump do something like this? Go figure, the Trump Organization just happens to be looking at Taiwan as a location for their next luxury resort.The Shangiist, a publication that covers news in China, reported the following in November:The mayor of Taoyuan confirmed rumors on Wednesday that US president-elect Donald Trump was considering constructing a series of luxury hotels and resorts in the northwest Taiwanese city.A representative from the Trump Organization paid a visit to Taoyuan in September, expressing interest in the city s Aerotropolis, a large-scale urban development project aimed at capitalizing on Taoyuan s status as a transport hub for East Asia, Taiwan News reports. With the review process for the Aerotropolis still underway, Taoyuan s mayor referred to the subject of the meeting as mere investment speculation. Other reports indicate that Eric Trump, the president-elect s second son and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, will be coming to Taoyuan later this year to discuss the potential business opportunity.The dire consequences that could come from this simple phone conversation cannot be understated. The only thing less surprising than Trump s stupidity is his willingness to sacrifice the United States for his own selfish gains. His businesses and foreign financial ties have come under scrutiny for the conflicts of interest they create now that Trump is going to be president. He hasn t even been sworn in yet and already he is saying to hell with America for the sake of his own bank account. This is exactly why this man should not be the leader of the free world.Featured image via Ty Wright/Getty Images",

        "title": "COLLEGE STUDENT SUSPENDED For Saying He Thinks Black Women Are: \u201cnot hot\u201d",
        "text": "Would this student have been suspended for saying he doesn t think blondes are  hot? Did Colorado College violate a student s First Amendment right to free speech when it suspended him for six months for stating online that he doesn t find black women attractive?We may never know, unless the student who was suspended takes legal action, and there has been no report of any such filing.But some free speech advocates would probably urge him to do so.On Nov. 9, an untold number of Colorado College students engaged in a Yik Yaks social media conversation regarding the topic  black lives matter,  according to a report from TheCollegeFix.com.What was supposed to be a serious discussion reportedly turned raunchy and over-the-top, with a number of participants posting distasteful comments.For instance, student Thaddeus Pryor said the conversation included a post describing white males as  dirty hippies  with undersized sexual organs who have sexual relations with relatives.At one point the topic changed to  black women matter,  to which Pryor anonymously replied,  They matter, they re just not hot. The next day several quotes from the online conversation   including Pryor s remark about black women   were reproduced on full-sized banners and hung in the Student Center near a dean s office, TheCollegeFix.com reported.The next thing he knew, Pryor was brought before a disciplinary panel, and learned he had been accused by rumor of being the author of most of the controversial posts in the conversation, the news site reported.Pryor admitted to writing the statement about black women, but denied writing anything else. And there is no way for the college to determine who wrote the other statements that Pryor did not accept responsibility for. Yik Yak is an anonymous social media application on smartphones that restricts posts to those within a geolocated boundary, like a college campus,  according to the Huffington Post.  While student have frequently protested in recent years over racist and offensive posts on the app, colleges have no way to identify who says anything on Yik Yak. College officials quickly moved to suspend Pryor. Senior Associate Dean of Students Rochelle Mason, Dean of Students Mike Edmonds and Assistant Dean of Students Cesar Cervantes decided in less than 24 hours that Pryor should be suspended for 21 months   the exact time it would take him to finish his degree   and prohibited from being on campus. Pryor appealed and his suspension was reduced to six months, but he still claims that college officials neglected his due process rights as defined by college policy, and essentially pronounced him guilty of authoring far more than the one post he accepted responsibility for. Pryor said someone  misled  officials about the number of comments he posted, according to the news site. In a lengthy appeal letter to Edmonds, Pryor said he voluntarily admitted to posting the  not hot  comment despite Mason and Cervantes having  no evidence  other than hearsay that he was involved with the Nov. 9 posts,  TheCollegeFix.com wrote. He said the college violated its own rules   not only by failing to inform him of his alleged violations until he was sentenced, but by incorrectly recording in  sanction papers  that Mason and Cervantes had even informed him of alleged violations of the  Student Code of Conduct. During my hearing, rather than presenting me with my possible violations then investigating my actions and how they may have constituted those violations, I was simply treated as broadly guilty,  Pryor was quoted as saying.Apparently private schools like Colorado College have more legal authority to censor speech than public schools, there remains a question about whether Pryor s rights were violated.A nonprofit called the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) contend that the college violated a statement published in a student guide that says,  all members of the college community have such basic rights as freedom of speech,  the Huffington Post reported. Because Colorado College is a private institution, it generally does not have to grant the same First Amendment free speech rights that a public school would. However, FIRE insists the school s statement about free speech in its college guide creates a  contractual obligation,  according to the Huffington Post. Via: EAG",

        "title": "SHOCKER: Washington Post Publishes OpEd Critical of Pro-Israel Law Which Shuts Down BDS",
        "text": "21st Century Wire says It s no secret that the US mainstream media enforces a very tight party line when it comes to saying anything about Israel. Generally speaking, any criticism of the  Jewish State  normally ends up in the editorial waste bin.The reason for this should be academic by now: powerful Israeli Lobby exists in Washington and with satellite branches across the US and Canada. The lobby s attack apparatus regularly coordinate media incursions and smear campaigns against any publication or journalist who dares to break rank and criticize Israel s appalling human rights record, endless violations of international law and flagrant ignorance of multiple UN resolutions. It consists mainly of the following organizations: the Anti-Defamation League (which devotes a large portion of its time and resources to defaming people it seeks to discredit), the quasi Masonic organization and godfather of the Jewish political attack organs B nai B rith International,  and of course, the ADL s ugly step child, the dubious  NGO  Southern Poverty Law Center. These organizations enforce their strict public relations code through a collection of tactics like threats and boycotts, including targeting a publication s advertisers and sponsors, or featuring a journalist, media pundit, author or academic on one of their many  Hate Lists , and by lobbing the standard charge of antisemitism against anyone who sounds remotely critical of Israel and its many failings.This week, David Cole, a national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, and Faiz Shakir national political director of the ACLU, penned a piece (see article below) in Jeff Bezos s recently acquired deep state propaganda mill, The Washington Post. In their impassioned piece, they posed the question of whether or not the recent US legislation called the Israel Anti-Boycott Act is moral in a modern democracy, or even legal for that matter. Incredibly, this new Pro-Israel law threatens fines and imprisonment to anyone who speaks of or campaigns to boycott, divest or sanction the Israeli state for its many and sundry documented international crimes. The level of tyranny inherent in this new piece of legislation is breathtaking to say the least. Simply put   it s a direct attack on the US First Amendment. What s worse is that it s being orchestrated from outside of the United States by a foreign entity. The bill s target is the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement, which is a global campaign that applies economic and political pressure on Israel to actually comply with international law (something the US government itself should also be doing). According to the authors, the new Orwellian law would also make it a crime to support or even furnish information about a boycott directed at Israel or its businesses called out by the United Nations, the European Union or any other  international governmental organization.  At its core, this law would constitute an anathema to any modern republican or democratic concept, and yet, this is what the Israeli Lobby seeks to impose on the people of the United States. So far, 45 US Senators have lined-up to support this bill, and not one member of Congress has joined the ACLU in denouncing it. On the Israeli payroll: US Senator Tom Cotton.Here s a fact that might be hard for some to swallow, but it s true: this law was only able to make it as far as it has because of the virtual stranglehold The Lobby has on nearly every member of the US House and Senate by way of lucrative campaign contributions to public officials by way of foreign lobbies like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), and backed-up by public and media pressure campaigns which, for those who have dared to step off the reservation, have ruined many a career in Washington. This lop-sided situation not only threatens US democratic interests at home, but it s also a serious threat to US national security. What this also demonstrates is how easily US Senators will disregard the US Constitution for a few hundred thousand dollars stuffed into their campaign bank accounts by a foreign lobby. You can see their financials here and here.It s left many onlookers asking: what s going on at the Amazon Post? The article is certainly measured and very careful in its wording, but the fact that it was allowed to appear at all might indicate that the deep state is loosening its restrictions on speech on Israeli issues in the US mainstream media. We hope this is the trend anyway, although maybe not if the ADL, B nai B rith, and the SPLC have anything to say about it.By far, this is the biggest attempt yet by Israel at hijacking the US democratic system, albeit from within. If this bill passes, it will mark the near end of what remains of the sovereignty of the United States of America. That is no exaggeration.Here s the OpEd . By David Cole and Faiz ShakirThe right to boycott has a long history in the United States, from the American Revolution to Martin Luther King Jr. s Montgomery bus boycott to the campaign for divestment from businesses serving apartheid  South Africa.Nowadays we celebrate those efforts. But precisely because boycotts are such a powerful form of expression, governments have long sought to interfere with them   from King George III to the police in Alabama, and now to the U.S. Congress.The Israel Anti-Boycott Act, legislation introduced in the Senate by Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) and in the House by Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.), would make it a crime to support or even furnish information about a boycott directed at Israel or its businesses called by the United Nations, the European Union or any other  international governmental organization.  Violations would be punishable by civil and criminal penalties of up to $1 million and 20 years in prison. The American Civil Liberties Union, where we both work, takes no position for or against campaigns to boycott Israel or any other foreign country. But since our organization s founding in 1920, the ACLU has defended the right to collective action. This bill threatens that right.The Israel Anti-Boycott Act is designed to stifle efforts to protest Israel s settlement policies by boycotting businesses in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. The bill s particular target is the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement, a global campaign that seeks to apply economic and political pressure on Israel to comply with international law.Whether one approves or disapproves of the BDS movement itself, people should have a right to make up their own minds about it. Americans engage in boycotts every day when they decide not to buy from companies whose practices they oppose. Students have boycotted companies that sold clothing manufactured in sweatshops abroad. Environmentalists have boycotted Nestl  for its deforestation practices. By using their power in the marketplace, consumers can act collectively to express their political points of view. There is nothing illegal about such collective action; indeed, it is constitutionally protected.In NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., the Supreme Court in 1982 upheld the right of NAACP activists to hold a mass economic boycott of segregated businesses in Mississippi. The court stated that the boycotters  exercise of their rights to  speech, assembly, and petition . . . to change a social order that had consistently treated them as second-class citizens  rested  on the highest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values. This is not to say that all boycotters are automatically free speech heroes; indeed, BDS advocates have themselves at times shut down Israeli academics or speakers to the detriment of academic freedom. Thus, it s understandable that free speech advocates might not immediately identify BDS supporters as victims of censorship. But when government takes sides on a particular boycott and criminalizes those who engage in a boycott, it crosses a constitutional line.Cardin and other supporters argue that the Israel Anti-Boycott Act targets only commercial activity. In fact, the bill threatens severe penalties against any business or individual who does not purchase goods from Israeli companies operating in the occupied Palestinian territories and who makes it clear   say by posting on Twitter or Facebook   that their reason for doing so is to support a U.N.- or E.U.-called boycott. That kind of penalty does not target commercial trade; it targets free speech and political beliefs. Indeed, the bill would prohibit even the act of giving information to a U.N. body about boycott activity directed at Israel.The bill s chilling effect would be dramatic   and that is no doubt its very purpose. But individuals, not the government, should have the right to decide whether to support boycotts against practices they oppose. Neither individuals nor businesses should have to fear million-dollar penalties, years in prison and felony convictions for expressing their opinions through collective action. As an organization, we take no sides on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But regardless of the politics, we have and always will take a strong stand when government threatens our freedoms of speech and association. The First Amendment demands no less.See the original article at the Washington PostREAD MORE ISRAEL NEW AT: 21st Century Wire Israel FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",

        "text": "A former governor of Puerto Rico shut down a question from MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski on Wednesday when she asked about President Donald Trump s treatment of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz.Trump and Cruz s interactions and criticisms have drawn national attention during the process of helping Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria, with Cruz charging that the Trump administration has been too slow in delivering federal assistance. Trump tweeted criticism of her over the weekend, saying she exhibited  poor leadership  and that others in Puerto Rico were not doing enough to  get their workers to help. Upon meeting each other face-to-face on Tuesday, Cruz told Trump it was saving lives and  not about politics.  Trump shook her hand and then walked away.After  Morning Joe  played the clip, a cross-armed Brzezinski looked disgusted. After welcoming former Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortu o to the show, she asked him what he made of Trump s treatment of Cruz. I m very sorry, Mika, but I m not going to get into local politics,  Fortu o said.Brzezinski did a double take upon hearing his answer. If she s running for governor, there are different parties I don t care,  Fortu o said.  I care about results. Is that what you think it is?  Brzezinski asked.  You think it was politics that had him attacking her? I have no idea,  he said.  All I can tell you is we need results. We have people that desperately need help. As long as we get that help, we should not be talking about politics at this moment. WFB",

The injunction is against the Center for Medical Progress, the group that has unveiled Planned Parenthood s participation in the sale of organs harvested from aborted children.Judge William H. Orrick, III, granted the injunction just hours after the order was requested by the National Abortion Federation.Orrick was nominated to his position by hardline abortion supporter President Barack Obama.

The decision will stay in place while the lawsuit moves through court.The Republican president s administration and two California governments that sued over the order disagreed about its scope.San Francisco and Santa Clara County argued that it threatened billions of dollars in federal funding.But an attorney for the Justice Department, Chad Readler, said at a recent court hearing that it applied to a limited set of grants.Some of Judge Orrick s comments are shocking:Judge Orrick said Trump s order  by its plain language, attempts to reach all federal grants, not merely the three mentioned at the hearing. The rest of the order is broader still, addressing all federal funding. And if there was doubt about the scope of the order, the president and attorney general have erased it with their public comments. Federal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the president disapproves. Note that once again activist judges use  public comments  just like they did in the prior block to an executive order. READ MORE: ABC7",

        "text": "CJ Pearson, the 12 year old conservative social media sensation who was bullied and threatened by grown-ups on the left, has more class in his little finger than the entire Democrat party combined. Here is a video message to President Barack Obama by CJ Pearson regarding his hatred for America that has over 1 million hits:The woman who launched an online campaign of bullying and veiled threats against Internet sensation CJ Pearson, frightening the young conservative s family enough to drive the boy briefly out of politics late last week, has been identified as a  top Democratic activist  from Baltimore.And the Pearson family is planning to press charges.According to a Facebook posting Sunday by Ali A. Akbar of Vice and Victory, a consulting firm that works with CJ, the woman behind the Twitter account  Mona Hussein Obama  is actually named Mona Brown. What she did was against the law,  Akbar said on the video, vowing to  expose a troll, a bully, a grown adult and top Democrat activist in Maryland for bullying a 12-year-old. Late last week, Brown began her Twitter campaign of harassment against Pearson in retaliation for Internet videos harshly critical of Obama that have made the boy an Internet sensation. Her tweets ranged from insults    your fam has been bowing down to white ppl    to hints of violence  Wish we could switch Trayvon s life for yours. On Facebook Friday, the 12-year-old announced he had had enough. After much thought and consideration, I ve decided to take a break from politics and political commentary,  he wrote.  I had a horribly rough night on Twitter after a woman not only threatened to sue me for expressing my opinions but threatened my family. The boy handed over his social media accounts to Vice and Victory, which quickly set up a support fund and hashtag #StandWithCJ.CJ s Facebook page now includes an apology Brown sent after her true identity became known. I apologize and am deeply ashamed of the horrible statements I made to @cjpearson,  she wrote.She then goes on to complain about how  the right wing  is attacking her family   apparently missing the irony that she earlier attacked the Pearson family and wished for their death.Pearson plans to get back into politics and says that the incident has only made his resolve stronger. After much thought and consideration, I have decided to press forward and continue to fight for what I believe in,  he wrote on Facebook.

        "text": "Texas Senator Ted Cruz is a weirdo. Even his Republican colleague, Senator John McCain has called him a  wacko bird. A few weeks ago a disturbing video from when Cruz was 18-years-old.  Aspirations, is that like sweat on my butt?  said Cruz in the beginning of the video. Cruz then goes on to add his life goal is to take over the world and be rich and powerful. The horrifying thing is if he is elected president, he would certainly use it to succeed in the latter, and his foreign policies would probably align with aspirations for world domination.Most recently, a high school yearbook photo of Ted Cruz has surfaced, and there is nothing endearing or nostalgically relatable about the photo. Ted Cruz went transferred to Second Baptist High School in his Junior Year of High School. Not surprisingly, Cruz desperately tried to assimilate with the cool kids, and by all accounts failed miserably. He was very active in drama club though. Cruz loved being on stage, even if it meant being the villain,  reported NPR in July 2015. In junior high school, he had played Rolfe, the young Nazi in The Sound of Music. He landed the role of the murderer Bill Sikes in Oliver during high school. The yearbook photo taken depicts another one of Cruz s creepy roles in high school, as a biblical mime, supposedly depicting the first man, Adam. In an interview with the Daily Dot, the photographer of the yearbook photo, Mark Neath, could not recall taking the photo, but did remember Cruz s strange life aspirations. I do distinctly remember him boasting that he would become president one day,  Neath wrote to the Daily Dot.  That s my greatest memory of him, in fact, since that was a pretty unusual life ambition for a high school student. Featured image courtesy of Second Baptist High School",

        "text": "Once again, a mouthpiece for Donald Trump gets their ass handed to them for blatantly lying on the air.During her show on Saturday morning, MSNBC host Joy Reid had to frustratingly correct Trump supporter David Malpass for making false claims about Hillary Clinton.It began with Reid talking about the alleged  pay-to-play  scandal Republicans have been accusing the former Secretary of State of conducting in conjunction with the Clinton Foundation during her years in the post.Reid explained that if Donald Trump gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation which then went to fighting AIDS in Africa, which benefits those who get treatment. Reid pointed out that getting a phone call from Clinton aide Huma Abedin is not proof of pay-to-play.However, Donald Trump giving $25,000 to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi s campaign in exchange for getting the investigation against Trump University dropped in that state is the very definition of pay-to-play.Malpass tried to claim that there were $10 million contributions but when challenged to provide proof of that claim Malpass could not do so. Reid called out Malpass for lying and went on to explain that the Associated Press found that only 85 of the meetings that Clinton had with people who were donors but not one of those meetings occurred after a donation was made.The AP story was  pilloried,  Reid said,  because they attempted to find pay-to-play and found nothing. Huma Abedin emailing you back is not getting something,  Reid continued.  It s Huma Abedin emailing you back. Malpass, however, desperately tried to pin something on Hillary Clinton and brought up her emails, which have nothing to do with the topic at hand. Reid called Malpass out again, but he continued to claim that the emails  brought out the information  about the Clinton Foundation. Malpass also claimed that Hillary Clinton has not held any press conferences but Reid corrected him again by pointing out that she held two last week.As Reid repeatedly shamed Malpass for  conflating press conferences, emails and foundations,  her other guest Kurt Eichenwald broke out in laughter because Malpass was clearly making false claims.By the end of the segment, a frustrated Reid admitted that her head hurts after having to debunk so much bullshit from Trump s minions.Here s the video via YouTube.Trump and his team are desperate to make anything Clinton does into a scandal. And that s why any claims they make that they are somehow winning this election are complete bullshit. A winning campaign does not have to stoop to telling outright lies to the media every day. But that is what Trump is doing because his poll numbers have imploded and his campaign has fallen off a cliff.Republicans have waged countless witch hunts using taxpayer money in an effort to sabotage the woman who stands in their way of absolute power and they have failed miserably because the investigations have always cleared Hillary Clinton of wrongdoing. Rather than admit that, Trump and his minions would rather repeat lies because it s all they have left.Featured image via screenshot",

        "text": "House Republicans leaders on Monday embraced a legislative plan to replace the Affordable Care Act for the first time in the nearly seven years since Democrats enacted the transformative health-insurance law.Now, they have to sell it.That challenge ran into an immediate threat from key conservatives who criticized the new proposal for failing to fulfill the party s iron-clad promise to rip out the signature policy of former President Barack Obama.  It s Obamacare in a different format,  Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, said in a phone interview. Jordan cited three provisions that conservatives have complained about for weeks leading up to the formal release of the House GOP plan on Monday evening: its extension of Obamacare Medicaid expansion for another four years; its failure to immediately repeal all of the law s tax increases; and its call to provide refundable tax credits to help people buy insurance, which Jordan labeled  a new entitlement. Earlier on Monday, another member of the Freedom Caucus, Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, condemned the leadership bill in a two-word tweet:  Obamacare 2.0.  The full Freedom Caucus comprises about three dozen members of the 237 in the House Republican majority. If they voted as a bloc, they could sink the bill on their own. A spokeswoman for its chairman, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, said members were still reviewing the legislation on Monday evening, and Jordan said the group planned to meet on Tuesday to discuss it.The reaction from conservative advocacy groups was no more favorable to the Republican leadership. FreedomWorks labeled the plan s requirement that people pay a 30 percent premium to insurers if they stop their coverage for more than two months  the Republican individual mandate. And on Tuesday morning, two more staunchly conservative activist organizations, Heritage Action and the Club for Growth, came out against the proposal.  Many Americans seeking health insurance on the individual market will notice no significant difference between the Affordable Care Act (i.e., Obamacare) and the American Health Care Act,  the group s president, Michael Needham said.  That is bad politics and, more importantly, bad policy. Rather than accept the flawed premises of Obamacare, congressional Republicans should fully repeal the failed law and begin a genuine effort to deliver on longstanding campaign promises that create a free market health-care system that empowers patients and doctors.  The Club for Growth pejoratively dubbed the new bill  RyanCare  and added a new threat, vowing to downgrade any Republican who votes for the bill in the group s closely-watched annual congressional scorecard.- The AtlanticThe introduction of the GOP s new healthcare bill has raised some definite ire among Republicans and Libertarians alike. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is one such politician who has now seen the bill and expressed his extreme dislike of it, calling the GOP plan  Obamacare Lite. According to The Hill, Paul is not letting Obamacare Lite happen without a fight, and he has allies. The libertarian leaning senator is teaming up with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) to release their own bill to repeal Obamacare on Wednesday, and it s highly similar to the one that Republicans voted for unanimously in 2015. We voted on this last year, and every Republican voted for it,  Paul said at a press conference alongside his House conservative colleagues.  That s what we should do again. You have to get rid of ObamaCare completely,  Jordan added. Paul stated in an interview earlier today that this GOP bill  will not pass,  and that  conservatives aren t gonna to take it.  However Paul and Jordan face an uphill struggle as GOP leadership, including that of President Donald Trump, seem to believe the bill to be a solid plan. We re going to do something that s great. And I am proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives,  Trump said of the bill.  It follows the guidelines I laid out in my congressional address. This will be a plan where you can choose your doctor and this will be a plan where you can choose your plan. And you know what the plan is. This is the plan.    The Blaze",

        "text": "Is there a law against waterboarding Republican Senators who continue to be re-elected even though it s pretty clear they should be running on the Democrat ticket Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) praised former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday   the day after the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued its final report.  She s an intelligent and capable person, no question about it,  McConnell told Time Warner Cable News, adding that he had worked well with her in the Senate and would be able to work with her as president.The Benghazi report details a pattern of incompetence, negligence, and dishonesty by Clinton and her associates. She failed to provide adequate security for U.S. diplomats in Benghazi; failed to take action to save U.S. personnel under attack on Sep. 11, 2012; and then falsely blamed an anti-Islamic YouTube video for inciting a protest that supposedly led to the attack.In addition, the Benghazi investigation uncovered the existence of Clinton s private email server, which violated State Department policies and may also have broken laws regarding the handling of classified information. Clinton seems to have used the server to evade Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, possibly in connection with fundraising for her family s private foundation while in office, including solicitations from foreign donors and governments. She has misled the public repeatedly about the email server, claiming falsely that she did not share classified information and that she had turned over all work-related emails to the government.Yet McConnell did not rule Clinton out. Instead, he said her presumptive Republican opponent, Donald Trump, had not yet proven himself qualified:Sen. Mitch McConnell:  Trump clearly needs to change, in my opinion, to win the general election. What I ve said to him both publicly and privately:  You re a great entertainer. You turn on audiences. You re good before a crowd. You have a lot of Twitter followers. That worked fine for you in the primaries. But now that you are in the general, people are looking for a level of seriousness that is typically conveyed by having a prepared text and Teleprompter and staying on message.  So my hope is that he is beginning to pivot and become what I would call a more serious and credible candidate for the highest office in the land. Geoff Bennett:  At the moment, though, I hear you saying he does not meet that threshold of credibility? McConnell:  He s getting closer. Getting closer. Via: Breitbart ",

Appearing on Fox News, actor Scott Baio let us in on why he supports the real estate mogul, and why others should as well. Although, he seems to just be emerging from the set of a 1940s mob themed movie.When asked why he likes Trump, Baio said: What do I like about Trump? There s no BS. I understand him when he talks. Whomever the Democrat nominee is, he s gonna beat the crap out of  em. Which is what we need. Instead of the crap beat out of us, and I like his policy proposals. What policy proposals? He s been all over the map on pretty much everything, except for his hatred of Muslims and that damn border wall.After being asked why people want Trump, he said: Well I think the thing is that Trump is not a typical Republican. He s sort of, you can t put a label on the guy, which I love. And because the media has stigmatized the Republican brand, he s smart to not cozy up to these guys, and he s unique. He s refreshing. He s exciting. I love to hear him talk, and I m excited about the guy. First of all,  refreshing,  really? Secondly, the media has not stigmatized the Republican brand, they did that to themselves by hating every minority group, the LGBT community, women s rights, and the poor. Blaming the media for reporting what they do is like blaming the guy who called 911 on the fire you set.

        "text": "While much of the nation s attention has been focused on the horrors of the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, there has been a revolt growing in the state of Michigan. Darnell Earley, is not only the unelected emergency manager who created the Flint water crisis, he also is in charge of Detroit s public schools. Earley has done to Detroit s schools, what he did to Flint s water system.The conditions of Detroit s school system are so bad, that teachers are on the verge of going on strike. They have been increasing their resistance to the attack and mismanagement of Detroit s schools over the past week. They have been engaging in a tactic called the  sick-out.  That s a protest where so many teachers call in sick, the school is forced to close.A picture is worth a thousand words. Here are some photos that show the deplorable conditions that students and teachers are being subjected to.Does your school look like this? #supportDPSteachers pic.twitter.com/jBGbkqoM4z  Detroitteach (@teachDetroit) January 15, 2016#supportDPSteachers pic.twitter.com/JJPDlBRPfG  Detroitteach (@teachDetroit) January 15, 2016Mushrooms in a classroom. #SupportDPSTeachers pic.twitter.com/97FZ53fxxe  Detroitteach (@teachDetroit) January 12, 2016No empowered school board.

It shows what life is like for teachers and students in Detroit.Detroit s mayor, Mike Duggan recently went on a tour of DPS schools. He was  heartbroken  over what he saw. I saw 4-year-olds in a classroom where it was about 50 degrees,  he said.  They told me they usually wear their coats until lunchtime, when they warm up a bit   because there s a part of each day they actually expect to have to wear their coats in the classroom. It s nice to hear that Duggan still has enough of a heart left to be broken. The tour was nothing more than a publicity stunt created to make it look like the state is trying to do something to fix the problem. Now that the nation is watching the state of Michigan and the Snyder administration s corruption and incompetence that has infected the entire state on every level, they really, really need to convince people that they care.Even with the Flint water crisis, the Detroit water crisis, the shame that is the DPS, Snyder cannot even bring himself to criticize emergency manager Earley. Here is what Snyder had to say about Earley and the teacher protesters last week: He s been doing a good job. He s been working hard. If you think about it, our goal is to get the Detroit Public Schools to be successful. I ve proposed a package that involves an investment of over $700 million to improve education in Detroit. I m not sure why people would want to go out and protest against a solution like that. The state of Michigan has been in control of Detroit Public School system for almost seven f##king years. The cries of anyone who have spoken out against the Snyder administration have been meet with silence. Snyder s $700 million dollar proposal should, at this point, be seen as nothing more than a last-minute attempt to try to bribe his way out of being lynched by a growing mob.Snyder and all his cronies must be brought to justice for their crimes against humanity.Featured Image Courtesy: Detroitteach via Twitter",

        "text": "We reported earlier about Dallas cop killer, Micah X. Johnson and his affiliation with the New Black Panther group, as well as Obama s past history with them. These acts leading up the GOP convention are no accident. We are living in dangerous times, and the most evil man to ever occupy our White House has been working in conjunction with BLM leaders to make sure this divisive movement succeeds The FBI issued an alert to Louisiana law enforcement agencies warning of violence against officers and planned riots in the aftermath of this week s high-profile fatal shooting of a black man by Baton Rouge Police. Judicial Watch obtained a copy of the situational information report, which was distributed to police and sheriff departments in Bossier, Caddo Parish and east Baton Rouge as well as Louisiana State Police.Titled  Violence Against Law Enforcement Officers and Riots Planned for 8-10 July 2016,  the alert warns that  multiple groups are calling for or planning riots and/or violence against law enforcement in Baton Rouge and Shreveport, Louisiana beginning Friday July 8 2016 and continuing through at least July 10, 2016. The document is labeled  FOUO  (For Official Use Only), a term the government uses to mark sensitive information that s not classified. It was issued by the New Orleans division of the FBI. The agency did not respond to multiple calls from Judicial Watch for comment.A spokesman for the Louisiana State Police Department, Lieutenant JB Slaton, referred Judicial Watch to the FBI and would not confirm or deny that his agency received it even though it appears on the list of recipients.  That s an FBI bulletin, they would need to address it,  Slaton told Judicial Watch after being provided with a copy of the FBI alert. When asked if his agency got the FBI alert Slaton continued to be evasive, responding that  it s an FBI bulletin. The alert is dated July 7 and includes disturbing images from social media, including one depicting a restrained uniformed police officer getting his throat slashed by a masked individual. Other social media images call for purging and killing all cops in Baton Rouge on July 9 and starting a riot by the courthouse in Shreveport that will tear shi_ _ down without killing our own black people.  Calling for unity in the violent protests, one social media post says  it don t matter what color you are.  Another says  must kill every police!!!!   Judicial WatchMeanwhile The  New Black Panther Party,  a militant racial group, announced that they will be arriving in Baton Rouge to protest outside of the Baton Rouge Police Department after Alton Sterling was shot during an altercation with a local officer, calling the headquarters the  pig department. On the group s social media, they called the police department the  Baton Rouge Pig Department,  a term that is often used by militants against police officers across the country, in an exclusive Hayride report.Check out the invitation to the protest, which is supposed to take place tomorrow and where sources tell the Hayride that out-of-towners are expected to show up in order to wreak havoc on the city.

        "title": "Just When Hillary Thought The News About Her Couldn\u2019t Get Any Worse\u2026This Bombshell From Secret Service Agents Happens [Video]",
        "text": "How this woman is even trending in the polls should tell you everything you need to know about the Democrat party Good morning, ma am,  a member of the uniformed Secret Service once greeted Hillary Clinton. F  off,  she replied.That exchange is one among many that active and retired Secret Service agents shared with Ronald Kessler, author of  First Family Detail,  a compelling look at the intrepid personnel who shield America s presidents and their families   and those whom they guard.Kessler writes flatteringly and critically about people in both parties. Regarding the Clintons, Kessler presents Chelsea as a model protectee who respected and appreciated her agents. He describes Bill as a difficult chief executive, but an easygoing ex-president. And Kessler exposes Hillary as an epically abusive Arctic monster. When in public, Hillary smiles and acts graciously,  Kessler explains.  As soon as the cameras are gone, her angry personality, nastiness, and imperiousness become evident.  He adds:  Hillary Clinton can make Richard Nixon look like Mahatma Gandhi. Kessler was an investigative reporter with the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post and has penned 19 other books. Among much more in  First Family Detail,  he reports:  Hillary was very rude to agents, and she didn t appear to like law enforcement or the military,  former Secret Service agent Lloyd Bulman recalls.  She wouldn t go over and meet military people or police officers, as most protectees do. She was just really rude to almost everybody. She d act like she didn t want you around, like you were beneath her. Hillary didn t like the military aides wearing their uniforms around the White House,  one former agent remembers.  She asked if they would wear business suits instead. The uniform s a sign of pride, and they re proud to wear their uniform. I know that the military was actually really offended by it. Former agent Jeff Crane says,  Hillary would cuss at Secret Service drivers for going over bumps. Another former member of her detail recollects,  Hillary never talked to us . . . Most all members of first families would talk to us and smile. She never did that. We spent years with her,  yet another Secret Service agent notes.  She never said thank you. Within the White House, Hillary had a  standing rule that no one spoke to her when she was going from one location to another,  says former FBI agent Coy Copeland.  In fact, anyone who would see her coming would just step into the first available office.  One former Secret Service agent states,  If Hillary was walking down a hall, you were supposed to hide behind drapes used as partitions. Hillary one day ran into a White House electrician who was changing a lightbulb in the upstairs family quarters. She screamed at him, because she had demanded that all repairs be performed while the Clintons were outside the Executive Mansion. She caught the guy on a ladder doing the lightbulb,  says Franette McCulloch, who served at that time as assistant White House pastry chef.  He was a basket case. White House usher Christopher B. Emery unwisely called back Barbara Bush after she phoned him for computer troubleshooting. Emery helped the former first lady twice. Consequently, Kessler reports, Hillary sacked him. The father of four stayed jobless for a year.While running for US Senate, Hillary stopped at an upstate New York 4-H Club. As one Secret Service agent says, Hillary saw farmers and cows and then erupted.  She turned to a staffer and said,  What the f - - - did we come here for? There s no money here. Secret Service  agents consider being assigned to her detail a form of punishment,  Kessler concludes.  In fact, agents say being on Hillary Clinton s detail is the worst duty assignment in the Secret Service. Watch Hillary show her true colors when a reporter in Africa accidentally refers to Barack Obama as  Mr. Clinton.  Hillary doesn t forgive her faux pas and does her best to embarrass the reporter:After studying the Secret Service and its relationships with dozens of presidents, vice-presidents and their families, Ronald Kessler s astonishment at Hillary Clinton s inhumanity should reverberate in every American s head.As he told me:  No one would hire such a person to work at a McDonald s, and yet she is being considered for president of the United States.

        "text": "Very few people with significant money or power in this country are voting for Donald Trump. Even the Koch brothers are publicly backing off supporting the toxic, self-described billionaire. One Silicon Valley billionaire is happy to be on the Trump train, even after the allegations of sexual assault surfaced. Perhaps that s because PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, who is also a Facebook investor and a $1.25 million Trump donor, doesn t really think sexual assault is a big deal.In 1995, Thiel wrote a book called  The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus.  If you think that sounds like a Trump-esque screed against political correctness, you d be right.The book isn t just about saying offensive words or about cultural appropriation. According to The Guardian s article on it, Thiel complained that in many cases, complaints of date rape were just regret by the victims.In a case about a 17-year-old Stanford freshman who said she was raped in a dorm room while drunk, Thiel and his cowriter and PayPal partner, David O. Sacks, wrote: Although [the alleged perpetrator] was clearly guilty of serving alcohol to an underage woman and taking advantage of her resulting lack of judgement, there was no sexual assault   Understandably, however, the woman regretted the whole incident afterwards. This argument has never made sense to me. In rape cases, the benefit of the doubt always goes with the accused rapist. A rape victim opens herself up to slander, to character assassination and to accusations exactly like the one above. Wouldn t the more logical response to regret to be to deny it ever happened?Thiel also believes that rape necessarily involves physical injuries, which would mean that those influenced by date rape drugs would likely have no claim, at least in his perfect world. It is ludicrous to believe that anyone who had been forcefully violated would not know it and bear physical marks. Then, there s this, because you know, men are always the victims: The purpose of the rape crisis movement seems as much about vilifying men as about raising  awareness.' Thiel s book, as described in The Guardian, goes on to complain about the many ways whites, and white men in particular, are victimized and vilified in this country. Is it any wonder he is supporting Donald Trump?Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images.",

If Johnny Carson had a particular political leaning, his viewers wouldn t have known what it was. When it came to criticizing President s of the United States, he was always funny but never hateful and certainly never vile. A lot has changed since then. It wasn t so long ago that  comedians  like Stephen Colbert only dreamed of sitting in one of the coveted late night comedy spots like the one Johnny Carson created. David Letterman s hate for conservatives and Republicans didn t really surfaced until he was nearing the end of his career, and although many wish he would keep his hateful opinions about our President to himself, he is a private citizen now and is not accountable to anyone for his petty remarks. The big question is, will anyone at CBS hold his predecessor Stephen Colbert responsible for his vile remarks about Trump having oral sex with Vladimir Putin? Will Colbert s advertisers pull their advertising dollars from his show like they did to FOX News  Bill O Reilly, after unproven allegations of sexual assault were made against him?As sad as it was to the world of comedy when Johnny Carson passed away, it s a good thing he isn t able to see how that the hateful and spiteful liberal Stephen Colbert has disgraced and replaced what once was considered late-night comedy.Last night, Stephen Colbert responded to #FireColbert backlash over a crude oral-sex joke he made about President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on Monday, May 1. Trump supporters and others thought the comment was inappropriate and called for the comedian to be dropped from the CBS show.The TV host, 52, opened his Wednesday, May 3, episode by addressing the controversy.  Welcome to The Late Show,  he said.  I m your host, Stephen Colbert. Still? I am still the host? I m still the host! Colbert went on to explain that his scathing monologue was spurred by Trump abruptly ending an Oval Office interview with fellow CBS correspondent John Dickerson.  Now, if you saw my monologue Monday, you know that I was a little upset at Donald Trump for insulting a friend of mine,  he said.  So at the end of that monologue, I had a few choice insults for the president in return. I don t regret that. He, I believe, can take care of himself. I have jokes; he has the launch codes. So, it s a fair fight.

We are now learning that the shooter, Dane Gallion, 29, had a gun on him during the movie because he was terrified of being killed during a mass shooting.According to the Seattle Times:Dane Gallion, 29, told officers he took the gun to Regal Cinemas 14 at the Landing on Thursday night because he was  concerned about recent mass shootings in public places,  according to a police account in a probable-cause statement released Saturday.That same anxiety prompted him to keep the gun unholstered in his waistband, the statement says.Think about that for a minute: our country has had so many mass shootings that this man was so scared to go to the movies, he felt he had to bring a weapon to protect himself.We all know that the  good guy with a gun  rhetoric that the National Rifle Association and Republicans like to spew is complete nonsense, but not everyone is as educated as those of us who want stricter gun laws. A great number of people are willfully ignorant and just believe the lines they are fed from the gun lobby and their supporters.This, of course, doesn t excuse the shooting. It definitely should have never happened. A gun owner should know how to properly handle a gun so that things like this do not happen. Frankly, Gallion should have never been allowed to carry a gun if he was that paranoid; After all, paranoia makes people do reckless things.However, it certainly proves how damaging the last decade or so s mass shootings have been on the psyches of the people in this country. Personally, I have a little ball of fear in the pit of my stomach every single time I go to the movies too, or when I drop my elementary school aged child off at school. How sad is that?

This letter will make you want to stand up and cheer for the 80 year old American who expresses what most of us are feeling right now. Enjoy RNC P.O. Box 96994 Washington DC 20090-6994Dear Representative,From the time I was able to vote I voted Republican. I am 80 years old, and have a great deal of respect and influence with hundreds of senior ball players who also network with thousands of others around the country.I received your questionnaire and request for money and strongly agree with every question, as I have since Obama was elected. Unfortunately the one question that was missing is  What have the Republicans done for the American people?  We gave you a majority in the House and Senate, yet you never listened to us. Now you want our money.You should be more concerned about our votes, not our money. You are the establishment, which means all you want is to save your jobs and line your pockets  Well guess what?  It s not going to happen  You shake in your boots when I tell you we re giving our support to TRUMP and he hasn t asked for a dime.You might think we are fools because you feel Trump is on a self destruction course, but you need to look beyond Washington and listen to the masses. Nobody has achieved what he has, especially in the liberal state of New York.You clearly don t understand why the Trump movement is so strong, so I d like to share with you an analogy to help explain the Trump phenomenon. By the way, it s not just the Republicans who feel ignored and disrespected, there are plenty of Democrats and Independents who also feel let down by the Washington elite. You seem to have forgotten about  We The People  and who hired you to represent us.So here it is, the best analogy I could come up with. Here is the reason so many Americans have boarded the Trump Train, and why you re pleas to come back to the party who deserted us, is falling on deaf ears:You ve been on vacation for two weeks, you come home, and your basement is infested with raccoons. Hundreds of rabid, messy, mean raccoons have overtaken your basement. You want them gone immediately You call the city and four different exterminators, but nobody could handle the job. There is this one guy however, who guarantees you he will get rid of them, so you hire him. You don t care if the guy smells, you don t care if the guy swears, you don t care how many times he s been married, you don t care if he was friends with liberals, you don t care if he has plumber s crack you simply want those raccoons gone! You want your problem fixed! He s the guy. He s the best. Period. Here s why we want Trump: Yes he s a bit of an ass, yes he s an egomaniac, but we don t care. The country is a mess because politicians have become too self-serving. The Republican Party is two-faced & gutless. Illegal aliens have been allowed to invade our nation. We want it all fixed! We don t care that Trump is crude, we don t care that he insults people, we don t care that he had been friendly with Hillary, we don t care that he has changed positions, we don t care that he s been married three times, we don t care that he fights with Megan Kelly and Rosie O Donnell, we don t care that he doesn t know the name of some Muslim terrorist.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegal aliens and bringing tens of thousands of Muslim refugees to America, while leaving Christians behind to be persecuted. We are becoming a nation of victims where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is part of a special group with special rights, to the point where we don t even recognize the country we were born and raised in;  AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED  and Trump is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We re sick of politicians. We re sick of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. We just want this thing fixed. Trump may not be a saint, but he isn t beholden to lobbyist money and he doesn t have political correctness restraining him. All we know is that he has been very successful, he s an excellent negotiator, he has built a lot of things, and he s also not a politician. He s definitely not a cowardly politician. When he says he ll fix it, we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Oh yeah I forgot we don t care if the guy has bad hair either.We just want those raccoons gone.Out of your house.NOW!",

So   maybe it s not his fault per say for this latest slip up of his (it is, after all, engrained into him) but little Trump ended up making quite the statement Monday night when he appeared on Fox s On the Record. It s so ridiculous even that maybe he does have a political future ahead of him, just like daddy.Here was what little Trump said when asked to explain what his dad meant by his  we ll do something worse than waterboarding  comments yesterday: You see these terrorists that are flying planes into buildings, right? You see our cities getting shot up in California. You see Paris getting shot up. And then somebody complains when a terrorist gets waterboarded, which quite frankly is no different than what happens on college campuses and frat houses every day. And, you know, the man would keep this country safe. There is no question about it. As he says, he  just wants to protect his father.  But, that s quite a statement he made. We re still trying to process it. We might even let such a ridiculous statement slide if it wasn t such a serious issue. Waterboarding is torture, end of discussion. We ve already dealt with George W. Bush s presidency; we don t need another. But, this is the main difference between Republicans and Democrats it seems; Trump isn t the only one who thinks waterboarding is okay. Ted Cruz has also come out on the record of saying it doesn t even fit the definition of torture, contrary to not only common sense but even the United Nation s definition. Here it is: Torture  means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession  when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public office or other person acting in an official capacity.Time and time again, highly credible experts and well-respected people have come forward on this issue, and all have said waterboarding is torture. This is a political issue of trying to look tough on terrorism, and it s also an election year. Deep down these guys don t care if it s torture or not; they think they re making the country safe. And, they re wrong.Featured image from screen capture.",

        "text": " Veterans are the backbone of the biker community We are patriots We love our cops The antithesis of the Black Lives Matter radicals Breitbart Exclusive: A large group of patriotic motorcycle enthusiasts will be among the visitors to Cleveland Ohio next week for the Republican National Committee meeting that will nominate business mogul Donald Trump to be the Republican nominee for President of the United States.Bikers for Trump aren t going to Cleveland looking to cause trouble but will be on hand to counter thousands of professional leftwing agitators planning to disrupt the Republican nominating convention. We will be there to make sure that the delegates are allowed to exercise their right to peacefully assemble,  Bikers for Trump organizer Chris Cox told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview.  We ve seen how these paid agitators have thrown eggs and gotten violent at other Trump events around the country and we re not going to put up with it. Cox emphasized that Bikers for Trump weren t looking for trouble at the convention.  Veterans are the backbone of the biker community,  Cox continued.  We are patriots and unlike Black Lives Matter and the other leftist idiots, we love our cops. You won t find one biker in Cleveland jumping on cars, lighting fires, or doing any of the other stupid things we ve gotten used to seeing on TV the last few months. Big  Jim Williams of Riders USA held a  Bikers for Trump  sign up at a rally in Arizona on July 10th, 2015 and the photo went viral.  I went to that first Trump rally with my Bikers for Trump sign and the next day the picture was all over the internet,  Big Jim told Breitbart News.  Donald Trump will say the things that need to be said and do the things that most politicians are too afraid to do. Big Jim will be making the long ride from Phoenix to Cleveland to be in Cleveland during the convention and he sent a letter to his fellow bikers telling them why they should join him. In a copy of the letter provided to Breitbart News he says:None of the bikers Breitbart News spoke with wanted to say how many would attend.  The city of Cleveland gave us a hard time with our permits and so we haven t really counted how many people are coming,  Cox said.  It s probably better because I want to work with all the other people who are drawn to be there. I ll be meeting with the secret service and the state and local police to let them know what we re all about. The bikers have also had significant success spreading the word on social media. The Facebook,  Bikers for Trump 2016  has more than 70,000 likes and has had months in which their reach counted in the millions. This video posted in April has nearly 250,000 views:Via: Breitbart",

        "text": "Randy Johnson 21st Century Wire  MIRROR MIRROR   Am I still just a movie concept?  Virtual  avatar  technology is in its infancy   as far as we know (Image: Actor Sam Worthington from the science fiction blockbuster film, Avatar).Is humanity s recent quantum leap with technology all fun and games, or a zombie-like march into the arms of a technocratic prison world?For generations we have seen global figures such as John F. Kennedy or Ronald Reagan speak on television and that s what we believed we have seen and heard.We have all heard, people say things such as  The President said it   it was on the news  or  she said it on TV, I saw it.  Ever since the invention of the medium of television, this has served as a sufficient casual reference to any event away from the local area.What if the words and image of a global figure, broadcast to millions on television, was not real?  What if your eyes and ears where literally deceiving you?Simply put, what if seeing isn t believing anymore?  What if the person on screen, on LIVE television, who is actually interacting with questions asked, was not the person being represented on screen?With technological advancements, as exemplified with the  still-in-development Face2Face system, the potential to present and act any person to an audience for multiple reasons, both good and bad, is here.  With respect to black budgets, exotic technology, and unknown classified advancements of similar computer systems and programs   technology beyond that of the Face2Face system could already be here and further advanced.What exactly is a Face2Face system?  TechCrunch.com describes it as taking,  A YouTube video of someone speaking like, say, George W. Bush.  Use a standard RGB [Red Green Blue] webcam to capture a video of someone else emoting and saying something entirely different.  Throw both videos into the Face2Face system and  you ve now got a relatively believable video of George W. Bush s face   now almost entirely synthesized   doing whatever the actor in the second video wanted the target s face to do. If the definition eludes you, then take a look at the Face2Face system in action.Watch below as life-like avatars of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Vladimir Putin follow visual commands in real time via the Face2Face system. That s great.  What about the voice you might ask?It does not take a wild imagination to envision voice software programs linked up with visual avatars for something like the Face2Face system in real time.Celebrity  voice changer  technology or other  voice morphing  software is already available at the consumer level.  Many security systems, phones, and buildings grant access by authenticating a person s voice.  There is even a real danger for people to have their actual voice  hacked  as they leave samples of it everywhere throughout the day.If the Face2Face technology, in a development stage as seen above, as does voice changing and voice recognition technology exists, then it only follows that the audio and the visual technology are destined to sync up.Just think of the implications.You could potentially have John Wayne, Elvis, Michael Jordan, Osama bin Laden, Miley Cyrus, or Justin Beiber wishing you happy birthday on a video message and interacting with you   Live.  It isn t really them, but then again it is them, just in a virtual reality sort of way.  Could there eventually be monetary charges to use the likeness of famous people dead or alive with certain companies owning certain celebrity s long dead and families of recent celebrities getting a cut?Perhaps a world leader could be dead for weeks and still delivering speeches or issuing orders. Anyone can be misquoted intentionally and questioned, framed, or made to fall from grace in the court of public opinion.  If you could take over another nation s airwaves, their leader can be seen saying something they said on television   except for the fact it isn t them and they never said it. Wars have been started for less.In the summer of 2015, 21WIRE discussed the use of a 3D avatar in the political realm, as India s Prime Minister Narendra Mohdi delivered a holographic speech at some 900 different rallies over the course of his campaign: Some would argue politicians are actors or entertainers in their own right, but hologram use is not limited to entertainers. Narendra Mohdi has already used the technology during his successful campaign to become India s Prime Minister. What would the future of electioneering look like with this new high-tech gadgetry?It has long been known that US political strategists have shaped elections throughout the world.In 2015, Hollywood released a fictionalized political comedy-drama named after a documentary called Our Brand Is Crisis (2005), a picture which gave a behind-the-scenes account of how James Carville and the political consultancy Greenberg Carville Shrum (GCS) socially-engineered the 2002 Bolivian elections to help Gonzalo S nchez de Lozada win the heavily contested presidency. He eventually resigned due to the so-called  Gas Wars,  where it was announced that he would follow pro-US economic policies and export natural gas to the US and Mexico.The documentary displays much of the socially-engineered electioneering that has been ongoing by the West for decades   it makes you wonder what future Western-backed campaigns might look like when aided by new tech, such as Spain s recent holographic protests, that featured thousands marching in avatar form.  SOCK PUPPET PROTEST?    New forms of political control on the horizon. (Image Source: americansuburbx)Media platforms are used to manipulate.  The very images we see all sorts of screens and media platforms can be planned, created, and manipulated through the use of actors, sets, and computer graphics.So technology doesn t have an effect on the masses and is rolled out to society  without a blueprint  so to speak?  Just consider the now common scene below.  NOMOPHOBIA    Technology, consumerism, and human behavior together.  So close, yet so far away   (Image Source: mymimtimsum.blogspot.com)Mass media in particular, is often utilized to shape opinions, drive agendas, and to communicate messages to the masses.  This is nothing new and can be as mundane as with advertising and marketing.  Specialized fields such as consumer psychologists and behavioral scientists became part of marketing teams and campaigns.  Corporations within the United States, China, United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan spent over 590 billion dollars on advertising in 2015.  In so many words, shaping masses in various aspects of behavior is literally seen as a science.Is mainstream  news reporting  above the fray and simply covering events?  Is shaping minds and creating trends limited to marketing and mass commercialism?  Probably not.  It is now becoming common knowledge that 6 umbrella corporations own about 90% of the media.  If you steer the minds, shape the laws, and build the consensus, you control the profits and get to select winners and losers.  The saying  The medium is the message seems as relevant as ever.Virtual Reality vs Old Fashioned Reality LAWNMOWER MAN  (left image)   In this 1992 science fiction film, drugs & virtual reality augment human intelligence. (Image Source: movpins)Virtual reality or deception is best brought in  through the front door  and accepted slowly via entertainment means.  Movies, televisions, computers, the internet, and smart phones are the norm and were presented to the masses as a means of entertainment, news, communication or learning, but have a dark side of conditioning, monitoring people, propaganda dissemination and changing or controlling human outlooks on reality.For those old enough to remember life before the year 2000, they might remember having human interaction that included interaction in close proximity to others.  Now, so-called social networking is something not done in person.  It s almost fashionable for someone to ignore their surroundings and introvert themselves into the world  of a device.Nothing beats connecting with other people more than losing oneself into the cyber reality of a smart phone   DIGITAL SLAVE    This is becoming a familiar sight.  When the conversation is this good, why go out?  (Image Source: Prezi.com)Fun and games, or a zombie-like walk into the arms of a technocratic world. The Face2Face system technology above is not unlike the virtual reality (VR) technology used to map a person s face and expressions to a VR avatar. Mark Zukerberg s Facebook has shown heavy interest in the technology, most notably with its 2 billion dollar purchase of Silicon Valley VR firm Oculus Rift.The global acquisitions of talent and start-up companies with expertise in virtual reality technology by Facebook has been notable and they have stated their intent to integrate social networking with virtual reality and avatars.Nothing beats getting people together and networking than a visual representation of themselves in a virtual reality scenario.Get with it!  Reality is so yesterday!   OCULUS RIFT   purchased by Facebook, can map and copy face movements in real time. It has vast potential for shaping reality via gaming and social networking.Ready or not, an ever-increasing technological world is on the way. Virtual reality devices are not likely to become common overnight. However, over time, especially for those who can remember, it will probably be like when there were no smart phones. Eventually humankind could reach a point where few remember what it was like without it.In addition to Face2Face types of technology, holographic and projection technology, as seen with  Face Hacking , could be intertwined with Face-2-Face and voice morphing technologies.Read 21st Century Wire s article Face Hacking: 3-D Projection Mapping in Real Time here.The potential can be as amazing as it is disconcerting.

That s why neighbors were shocked when the terrorist flag appeared in a local neighborhood hanging from a fence near the town dam and river. Police immediately removed the flag from the fence which was on state property.JUST AN FYI: In the past 5 months, the state department has settled 290 Muslim refugees in New Hampshire.Pittsfield, NH has been designated a  welcoming city  which is code for BRING ON THE REFUGEES! If you want to know the number of refugees who have come to your town in the past 5 months, please go here: WRAPSNETAuthorities are working with the FBI and have questioned a person of interest in this effort to flaunt a terrorist symbol. The local authorities are now working with the FBI to  determine if a crime was actually committed This chart is ridiculous! Why are these people still here? Why should Americans have to put up with having ISIS anywhere near us?  The Pittsfield Police Chief had this to say about the flag:  Giving what that flag represents, it understandably caused public alarm and concern. The flag itself is probably going to be protected under freedom of speech. THE RESPONSE FROM NEIGHBORS IS GREAT:Neighbors are responding by flying American flags outside of their own homes.So what re we supposed to do about this  person of interest ?

        "text": "Have you ever seen something so stupid that you wish you could just go back to bed on the off-chance that it was a dream? That s how my day has gone so far. You know, we regularly hear from the NRA that gun owners are  responsible  individuals ready to leap into action and save us from all the ISISes, Commies, and other assorted (largely imaginary)  bad guys  who are lying in wait to attack us while we re walking around a grocery store or eating at Chipotle (though, of course, the food there might be seen as a reasonable threat these days). In some incredibly rare circumstances, it might be useful to have a gun. But, as usual, one of the NRA s Chosen has reminded us that the risks of universal gun ownership far outweigh the benefits.A woman who reportedly lives in the Southern United States didn t like that her kids disobey her, practically live on social media, and basically are teenagers. While most parents would take their children s electronics to teach them some respect, this unnamed woman decided a SECOND AMENDMENT SOLUTION was in order   so she grabbed her shotgun and began shootin  stuff while someone else recorded. I hereby denounce the effects that social media have on my children,  the mom shouts at the beginning of the video, her trusty boomstick ready to dish out some justice. Their disobedience and their disrespect.  She then takes aim at her children s iPhones and fires a shot, blasting them to bits. She then instructs the man behind the camera to place the broken bits of electronics back on the tree stump because she isn t quite through with them yet.Up to this point, the kids have been quite disrespectful, cursing at her and even flipping their mother  the bird.  In other words, she is likely right that they deserve punishment   but she continues to take things to the extreme I refuse to be cursed,  she bellows.  I refuse to be disobeyed. I take back my role as your parent.  This shining example of much of what is wrong with America then instructs the cameraman to make sure the kids are on camera   and they can be seen standing with their arms crossed as their mother continues to go insane. One of them throws up both middle fingers because he s exactly the sort of kid someone like this would raise. She fires another shot, blowing the already-destroyed cell phones to even smaller bits. Anything left put it on top,  she tells the cameraman who dutifully obeys. Mom then announces that she refuses  to have them influenced in negative ways    like, hypothetically, if their mother were to line them up and force her children to watch her shoot their belongings while screaming like a crazy woman. She wouldn t stand for that. Oh, wait To emphasize her point, she grabbed a sledgehammer and beat the fragments of the phones with it. I m done,  she yelled as she dropped the hammer and walked away.It s easy for some to imagine a world in which everyone is armed   but they fail to realize that people like this woman exist, who think a Second Amendment Solution is appropriate for even the most mundane of scenarios. She was not defending her home, saving lives, hunting, or even fighting back against an oppressive government. She used her weapon in an apparently failed attempt to intimidate her children (but let s face it: everyone in this scenario is an asshole). Fortunately, no one was hurt, but someone could have been.

Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think it s perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow.Biden said: This is a guy who said   and wants to be president   that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about? Adding: Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are. Then really getting to the core of it, he said: He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don t take pleasure from  You re fired.  They don t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit. Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and don t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage. He acknowledged that he didn t pay taxes because, he said, he s smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here who s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me. Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates: If this choice isn t clear, I don t know  - my lord  What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people. And it s true, the choice is abundantly clear   Hillary Rodham Clinton should and will be our next president.Watch Biden lay into Trump here:WATCH: VP Biden goes off on Trump over Trump s comments about not paying taxes:  It angers me!

The vigil was led by people from Charlottesville and across the country who had marched 118 miles from downtown Charlottesville to Washington to call for all white supremacists to be removed from government, including the President.One of the organizers:  It speaks volumes about our country that a permit would be issued for a white supremacist rally, yet our nonviolent 24-hour vigil against our white supremacist government would be broken up by a public institution.

        "text": "Texas Senator Ted Cruz has won the 2016 Republican presidential caucus in Iowa. Cruz won with 99% of Iowa precincts reporting in. He earned 28% of the vote, with about 46,400 Republicans casting their vote for the social conservative.Cruz beat out Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, beating out the result of the highly respected Des Moines Register poll, that had put Trump ahead of Cruz by 5%.Many observers believe that Cruz was able to overcome Trump s constant media appearances and a campaign that sucked up a lot of the oxygen in the political world.While Cruz has won the caucus, history has not been kind to recent winners. The last two winners, Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee, received a bump in support after winning the caucus, but were not able to martial the religious right on to success in other states like South Carolina and New Hampshire.Cruz also faces headwinds from Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who did better than expected in a third place finish. It can be expected that money from the Republican establishment will flow to Rubio, continuing the stampede away from Jeb Bush who only managed a single digit in Iowa and is not expected to be a strong contender in New Hampshire.In a strange turn of events, Trump could act as a spoiler candidate, wedged between Cruz and Rubio but without being beholden to big ticket donors or the party elite.For the general election, many Democrats are probably salivating over a candidate like Cruz. He is anti-choice, a darling of the extremist right, and a candidate who has based his entire run on turning out far right voters instead of even remotely attempting to appeal to moderate, swing voters. Trump may have scared the party so much that Cruz now appears  acceptable  to them, but not to America.Featured image via Flickr",

Tim Kaine, who told Telemundo in Spanish that he and Hillary Clinton would push legalize 12 million illegals in their first 100 days in the White House, is also a proponent of bringing up to 1.8 million more foreign workers sought by U.S. outsourcing companies.Kaine, who on Wednesday is expected to win the nomination as the Democratic vice presidential candidate here, was one of several co-sponsors of S. 169, the so-called I-Squared Act, that would have boosted visas for high-tech workers from 65,000 to 300,000 a year.Because the H-1B employment visas last six years, that bill and a similar one currently under consideration in the Senate could bring in 1.8 million new workers.The visas have become controversial because many big firms who apply for the visas are replacing higher-wage American workers with cheaper foreign help.Read more: WE",

        "title": " Michele Bachmann Comes Out Of Hiding To Mourn Scalia On Twitter \u2014 Gets His Name Wrong (TWEETS)",
        "text": "Michele Bachmann is easily one of the craziest people to ever grace the halls of Congress. She spent her entire tenure being a complete embarrassment and disgrace to the institution which she served, spending more time ranting about abortion, religion, and gay people than actually, you know, trying to govern. All sane people were giddy with glee when she decided not to run for re-election. Shortly thereafter, she faded into the bowels of the more humiliating and shameful parts of America s history, right where she belongs.Well, with the death of extreme right-wing Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, former Congresswoman Bachmann has emerged from her vampire crypt to tell the world just how much she admired the man. She sent out a tweet just hours after his death that read: God Bless Anthony Scalia, finest Sup Ct Justice RIP God bless Anthony Scalia, finest Sup Ct Justice RIP  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016There s just one problem with that: his name is Antonin Scalia, not Anthony. This nitwit can t even get that much right, yet, after that major f*ck up, Bachmann went on to go on a tirade about who should replace the deceased Justice, and, of course, only other extreme right-wingers are even a little bit acceptable to her. Here is that series of insane tweets:Obama must appoint a constitutional originalist to replace Justice Scalia, nothing else will do.  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016She even had the gall to compare Scalia s insane ramblings to William Shakespeare s masterpieces.Reading a Scalia dissent was akin to reading a Shakespearean sonnet. RIP  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016Now Scalia belongs to the ages. Let's add his profile to historical lawgivers which surround the US House chamber.  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016Scalia will be read and quoted 200 years hence, if America survives. RIP  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016He ll be quoted alright, just not in the way that you think. Thank goodness you re no longer in the business of making our laws.Featured image from AI Archives",

        "title": " Breitbart Caught Praising Melania For Exact Thing They Once Viciously Smeared Michelle Obama Over",
        "text": "In a stunning example of just how morally bankrupt right-wing media has become in the Age of Trump, Breitbart   the conservative website often described as Trump s de facto propaganda wing   wrote a lavish piece praising Melania Trump for her  high fashion  outfits while accompanying her husband on his first overseas trip.Who cares, right? Why would anyone have a problem with what the first lady is wearing on a trip?Well, Breitbart, the very same website, seems to   albeit only when it s the African-American wife of America s first African-American president. Here s the sneering way they covered Michelle Obama s decision to wear a $3,200 dress on the former president s visit with the pope.Politico reports that First Lady Michelle Obama, looking lovely and classy, greeted Pope Francis Tuesday while wearing a $2,290 dress. While the Obamas are not Catholics, this is still a finger-in-the-eye to a White House guest who frequently speaks out   to wild Democrat applause   about the evils of excessive capitalism.And adding to the absurd critique:According to WorldVision, you can feed a child for just $35  a month. Michelle Obama s dress would feed over 80 children for that month. This choice obviously is contrary to the values of Pope Francis. But the Obamas  religious values come from elsewhere, a divisive and disturbing place, not a charitable or unifying one.Almost beyond parody.Flash forward to this weekend. Melania was treated to a photo spread, with Brietbart praising her outfits, including an expensive custom-made creation from fashion designer Dolce & Gabbana.In a visit to meet Pope Francis, Melania worked with Dolce & Gabbana, again, on a stunning custom-made, black coat-dress that showed off a beautiful round collar, framing the First Lady s face. The look was paired with a black lace Mantilla and black Manolo Blahnik stilettos, sticking to the Vatican dress code.The next day, Melania would don a dress that cost $51,000. Conservatives didn t bat an eye.Let s crunch those numbers through Breitbart s bullshit calculator:According to WorldVision, you can feed a child for just $35 a month. Melania Trump s dress would feed over 1400 children for a month. But then the Trump s religious values come from elsewhere, a divisive and disturbing place, not a charitable one. (This comparison, however tongue-in-cheek, is actually unfair in more ways than one, the Obamas actually do have a history of charitable giving. Trump is famous for not donating to charity. A truly  divisive and disturbing  worldview, if there ever was one.)As the above passages exemplify, Breitbart loved to apply ridiculous, nonsense standards to the Obamas that they would never dream of holding the Trump family up to. The website once run by anti-Semite Steve Bannon and which has a section devoted to  black crime  has some pretty obvious, bigoted reasons for hating the Obamas. It s egregious but not particularly surprising then that they would find the white first lady s opulence charming while finding the black first lady s show of class distressing.Featured image via Franco Origlia/Getty Images / h/t Mikel Jollett",

        "text": "Democratic party leaders from four states have officially filed federal lawsuits against Donald Trump and his advisor Roger Stone, as well as the state Republican parties for conspiring to threaten, intimidate, and thereby prevent minority voters in urban neighborhoods from voting in the 2016 election. The lawsuits, which have been filed in Arizona, Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, were spearheaded by Marc Elias, who is the general counsel for Hillary Clinton s campaign. The suits request a federal judge to step in and prevent the defendants from activities such as monitoring polls and verbally harassing voters.The suit against Trump, Stone, and the Nevada Republican Party, which was filed by the Nevada Democratic Party, quotes an unnamed Trump official who said, [w]e have three major voter suppression operations under way.  This, says the suit, is proof of their intentions.The complaint also says: Trump s supporters have responded with pledges to descend upon polling places in  certain areas  where many minority voters live in order to interfere with their efforts to exercise the franchise Immediate relief is necessary. There are only 8 days left until Election Day, and early in-person voting in Nevada is well underway. Trump s calls for unlawful intimidation have grown louder and louder, and the conspiracy to harass and threaten voters on Election Day has already resulted in numerous acts that threaten to interfere with the voting rights of registered Nevada voters. Stop the Steal, a super PAC formed by Stone, is also named in the suit. According to the lawsuits, Stone has a history of engaging in voter intimidation, racist and misogynist hate speech, and incitement to violence. The complaint further states that Trump has repeatedly spread  misinformation  about voter fraud by claiming that the election is rigged against him. An example of this is October 20 when Trump told a crowd gathered at a rally in Delaware, Ohio that Clinton is  truly capable of anything, including voter fraud. The lawsuit also states that Trump, Stone, and the local Republican parties have blatantly violated both the Voting Rights Act and the Klu Klux Klan Act.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",

A federal judge then blocked the order and Trump has been attacking U.S. District Court Judge James Robart ever since.The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017Trump has literally been whining about Judge Robarts  decision for over a week and acts like judges aren t allowed to act as a check and balance against the executive branch.And his behavior toward Robarts has angered one federal judge so much that he is calling Trump s legitimacy into a question, which is a yuuuge deal.Federal District Judge Dan Polster explained to the Cleveland Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday and explained that checks and balances exist because the Founding Fathers  were fearful of a president who might want to be a king or dictator,  which is exactly how Trump is acting.Polster continued by telling the audience that he doesn t think any federal judge will be intimidated by Trump because they  took an oath to support and defend the Constitution and it means a lot and I think that oath means even more today. With that said, Polster believes Trump undermined his legitimacy by attacking the judicial branch for halting the executive order. This is serious business, because you start calling into question the legitimacy of someone, that undermines the whole system, all right? I think to say it publicly, that s his right. But it calls into question, and some might even say forfeits, his or her own legitimacy. So I ll leave it at that. It s an important question, but that s how I feel. When you call into question the legitimacy of a federal district court judge, that s a line that shouldn t be crossed. And there you have it. Trump s attacks on our judicial branch are literally starting to backfire on him as judges start to speak out publicly against him. While Trump has the right to disagree with judges, personally attacking them disgraces the office he holds and diminishes the power of the executive branch. It makes Trump s position look weak and desperate. And it could affect the decisions judges make in the future on executive orders and laws Trump signs. In short, trying to bully judges is not a good idea.Read more:Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",

The two things that are so outrageous about this entire case are that there was NO OVERSIGHT and that this WENT ON FOR 8 YEARS!!!USING THE FEDS AS YOUR OWN PERSONAL PIGGY BANK:Lorena Loren s job was to help poor people find housing Instead, prosecutors say, she was stealing from the poor to buy booze, makeup, clothes and homes for her relatives.But after years of scheming, authorities say, the government caught on. IT TOOK 8 YEARS!In a public corruption case that surfaced in federal court today, Loren, the former executive director of the St. Clair Housing Commission, was charged with embezzling more than $300,000 in low-income housing funds and spending the money on herself and family.According to a charging document filed in U.S. District Court, Loren s scheme ran between 2008-2016 and benefited many family members, including her husband, son and son-in-law.Prosecutors say Loren s criminal activity started in 2008   five years after she was appointed executive director of the St. Clair Housing Commission, which administers federally funded low-income housing programs in St. Clair County.According to court records, Loren used her job in many nefarious ways, including:  She fraudulently used the housing commission s two credit cards to buy personal items for herself and relatives, including nearly $135,000 in online purchases from Amazon.com; $14,364 in purchases from Sam s Club in Port Huron, and $16,460 in purchases from various Walmart stores. The purchases included, among other things, adult and infant clothing, furniture, food, beauty supplies, medications and alcoholic beverages.  Her unauthorized Amazon.com purchases included $60,000 worth of bedroom furniture, mattresses, appliances and other household items for family members. The items were shipped to Loren s relatives in Georgia and Florida.  She embezzled $24,600 in commission funds to pay for her son s rental unit.  She lied on four government housing contracts by claiming that her son-in-law was the landlord of a rental property for low-income residents in Michigan, when it was really her home in Port Austin.  She falsified lease agreements and stole public housing money that was supposed to help poor people to rent a home for her son.  She  directed members of her family to establish bank accounts  so that federal rental subsidy payments could be deposited into those accounts. The relatives then used the money for their own personal use, including rent for their Florida residences.Loren is charged in what is known as an information, which typically means she is working on a deal with the government. She is charged with conspiracy to commit federal program fraud. If convicted, she faces up to five years in prison.Loren home Lorena Loren bought this $325,000 home in Georgia after federal prosecutors say she embezzled more than $336,000 from the St. Clair Housing Commission.JUDICIAL WATCH: HUD s inspector general has testified before Congress about the severe mismanagement at offshoots functioning independently yet federally funded in states across the country that have fleeced taxpayers out of hundreds of millions of dollars. He testified that his office discovered more than $200 million in questionable spending at local public housing agencies (PHAs) since 2012. PHAs are created by states, operate at the city or county level and administer the federal program known as Section 8 to provide low-income people with affordable housing. Many of these local public housing agencies are run by people with  troubled backgrounds  that somehow manage to remain in high-ranking positions at the agencies, the watchdog told lawmakers back in 2014.DR BEN CARSON NEEDS TO CLEAN THIS UP STAT!READ MORE: DFP",

        "text": "Donald Trump just did Russia a big favor to thank them for rigging the election in his favor.As the fallout continues from a CIA assessment that Russia hacked into our election system and helped Trump beat Hillary Clinton, Trump continued to make it clear that he will nothing more than Vladimir Putin s puppet in the White House by selecting a longtime friend of the Russian leader for America s top diplomatic officer.Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson has apparently been offered the job of Secretary of State after weeks of speculation and concern.But unlike some of the other choices for the position, Trump literally picked a guy who has a huge conflict of interest when it comes to Russia. Not only does Tillerson and Big Oil stand to profit mightily from closer ties with Russia, Tillerson is a close friend of Putin and will likely treat Russia in a way that goes entirely against American interests and security.According to the New York Times,Mr. Tillerson has worked to strengthen Exxon Mobil s ties with Russia. The company has various joint ventures with the oil giant Rosneft around Russia, and has contributed to social programs in education and health.So Tillerson is deeply connected in Russia just like Donald Trump. And like Trump, Tillerson also wants to remove sanctions against Russia that were put in place after Putin attack Ukraine and seized the Crimea.In fact, the intelligence community and national security experts are already concerned about Trump s pick.Intelligence expert Malcolm Nance appeared on MSNBC on Saturday to warn about the danger the choice of Tillerson represents to the nation. Do we want a Secretary of State who is going to be working hand in hand first and foremost for the U.S. and Russian petrochemical industries?  Nance asked.  Most importantly, he has a very deep relationship with Vladimir Putin that extends back to when Putin was the director of the FSB, which is the modified version of the KGB. Does this person who speaks very highly of Putin, who has got the Order of Friendship from Russia, will he accurately represent the interests of the United States first or will he still be part of that cabal from the Kremlin that Donald Trump appears to have assembled in his cabinet? Here s the video via VidMe.Donald Trump s connections to Russia make him a threat to national security and our NATO alliances and he just proved that by choosing Tillerson as his Secretary of State, a friend of Putin s who will be reluctant to stand against Russia if Putin makes aggressive moves toward our European allies.It won t be Trump making the decisions for our country.

        "text": "Welcome to the big leagues, kid.Donald Trump s Supreme Court Justice only made it through Senate confirmation because Republicans changed the rules so they could complete their robbery of the seat from President Obama pick Merrick Garland.Neil Gorsuch now sits on the high court and his first day was Monday. And of course, just like Trump, he embarrassed himself from the get-go.Gorsuch s first case involved a Census Bureau worker who had been dismissed and filed a lawsuit over it.The former government employee s lawyers want the entire case to be allowed to move forward instead of only part of it being heard by the federal appeals courts. Rather than keep his mouth shut and learn, Gorsuch apparently decided to try to prove that he belonged there.And he didn t waste time. Gorsuch was argumentative and spent lots of time on wording. In other words, it looks like Gorsuch is going to be an asshole judge who is going to base every decision he makes on exact wording and his interpretation of those words. He s going to nitpick and decide cases on technicalities.But then Gorsuch decided to go even further by changing the decorum of the court. Channeling Trump, Gorsuch literally accused attorney Chris Landau of lying in open court.According to Bloomberg,Landau asked the court to let the man s entire suit go forward in a federal district court, rather than waiting for part of the case to be addressed first by a federal appeals court. When Landau said he wasn t asking the court to  break any new ground,  Gorsuch gave a pointed response. No, just to continue to make it up,  Gorsuch said.But Landau is correct. As Bloomberg points out, there is plenty of precedent of the Supreme Court allowing such lawsuits to move forward in their entirety. So Landau really isn t asking the high court to do anything different than it has before. He s asking them to uphold precedent, something Gorsuch clearly has no interest in doing regardless of what the law says.But Justice Elena Kagan was quick to put Gorsuch in his place and humiliated him in the process. This would be kind of a revolution,  she began.  I mean, to the extent you can have a revolution in this kind of case. The room laughed as everyone recognized a good Supreme Court burn.So just like Donald Trump, Gorsuch is an embarrassment.Frankly, not only should Trump be impeached, Gorsuch should be impeached as well. He doesn t belong in the position he currently holds. It s clear he has no respect for Supreme Court decorum and that he will make partisan decisions regardless of precedent and the law. And Republicans are the ones to blame for this. They chose Trump to be their leader and they forced Gorsuch upon the Supreme Court. It s up to Democrats to fix both of these embarrassments as soon as they take back control of Congress.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",

        "text": "A speech for the ages was given today by President Donald Trump. He addressed the 72nd meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York for the first time in his presidency. The transcript is below.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, world leaders, and distinguished delegates: Welcome to New York. It is a profound honor to stand here in my home city, as a representative of the American people, to address the people of the world.As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before.Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. The stock market is at an all-time high   a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time. And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed.We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Breakthroughs in science, technology, and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve.But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value. Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems, and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II.International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people; force dislocation and mass migration; threaten our borders; and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens.To put it simply, we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril. It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams, and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear.This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Those three beautiful pillars   they re pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity.The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent, and free. As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time,  Our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations. The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and for the world.We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is foundation for cooperation and success.Strong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures, and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect.Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. And strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.In America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example. We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution   the oldest constitution still in use in the world today.This timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity, and freedom for the Americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity, and the rule of law.The greatest in the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. They are:  We the people. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great history. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign. I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, where it belongs.In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Our government s first duty is to its people, to our citizens   to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values.As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. (Applause.)All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. But we can no longer be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in return. As long as I hold this office, I will defend America s interests above all else.But in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it s in everyone s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure.America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations Charter. Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall. America s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies, from the beaches of Europe to the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.It is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion, or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.For the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope. We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife. We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We have a policy of principled realism, rooted in shared goals, interests, and values.That realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in this room. It is a question we cannot escape or avoid. We will slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats, and even wars that we face. Or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today, so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow?If we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their futures. We must reject threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders, and respect for culture, and the peaceful engagement these allow. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries.If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength.No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.We were all witness to the regime s deadly abuse when an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later. We saw it in the assassination of the dictator s brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport. We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea s spies.If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply, and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict. No nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles.The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. That s what the United Nations is all about; that s what the United Nations is for. Let s see how they do.It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-0 votes adopting hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. Thank you to all involved.But we must do much more. It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.We face this decision not only in North Korea. It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime   one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room.The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy. It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos. The longest-suffering victims of Iran s leaders are, in fact, its own people.Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors. This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran s people, also goes to shore up Bashar al-Assad s dictatorship, fuel Yemen s civil war, and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East.We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program. (Applause.) The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don t think you ve heard the last of it   believe me.It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran s government end its pursuit of death and destruction. It is time for the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained. And above all, Iran s government must stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people, and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors.The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran s people are what their leaders fear the most. This is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protestors, and imprison political reformers.Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? Or will the Iranian people return to the nation s proud roots as a center of civilization, culture, and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once again?The Iranian regime s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financing.In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world.We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We must drive them out of our nations. It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people.The United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. From now on, our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations, not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians.I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups. In Syria and Iraq, we have made big gains toward lasting defeat of ISIS. In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many, many years combined.We seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens   even innocent children   shock the conscience of every decent person. No society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread. That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.We appreciate the efforts of United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from ISIS, and we especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict.The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries, to be part of the rebuilding process.For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region, and we support recent agreements of the G20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible. This is the safe, responsible, and humanitarian approach.For decades, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere. We have learned that, over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries.For the sending countries, it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform, and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms.For the receiving countries, the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government.I want to salute the work of the United Nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The United Nations and African Union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa. The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, and northern Nigeria and Yemen.We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like PEPFAR, which funds AIDS relief; the President s Malaria Initiative; the Global Health Security Agenda; the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery; and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.We also thank   (applause)   we also thank the Secretary General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Too often the focus of this organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process.In some cases, states that seek to subvert this institution s noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council.The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.Major portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell. But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world. In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden, militarily or financially. Nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions.That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom. My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapse.The socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried. To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.The Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing. Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch.As a responsible neighbor and friend, we and all others have a goal. That goal is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors.I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela. (Applause.)The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. (Applause.) From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems.America stands with every person living under a brutal regime. Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action. All people deserve a government that cares for their safety, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal.For too long, the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals, and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. Others gamed the system and broke the rules. And our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again.While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government: the duty of our citizens. This bond is the source of America s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today.If this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the  independent strength of its members.  If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign, and independent nations   nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens, and for all that is best in the human spirit.In remembering the great victory that led to this body s founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved.Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France, and the Brits to stand strong for Britain.Today, if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts, and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities, and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us.We cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucrats   we can t do it. We must solve our problems, to build our prosperity, to secure our futures, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.The true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures, and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was  effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. That was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation. We realized who we were, what we valued, and what we would give our lives to defend. From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people, and their patriotism.History is asking us whether we are up to the task. Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself.Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others, and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all: a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth.This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people, and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul.So let this be our mission, and let this be our message to the world: We will fight together, sacrifice together, and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humanity, and for the almighty God who made us all.Thank you. God bless you. God bless the nations of the world. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.",

        "title": "MICHIGAN Senate Approves Bill To Allow Concealed Carry In \u201cGun Free Zones\u201d Or \u201cMass Murderer Empowerment Zones\u201d",
        "text": "Should legal gun owners be allowed to freely carry anywhere in their state, including dorm rooms and school campuses?In the wake of mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas that left dozens of people dead or injured, a Michigan Senate committee approved bills Tuesday that will allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons in gun-free zones such as schools, churches, day care centers, bars, dorms, and stadiums.The shooting at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday, which left 26 people dead and 20 more injured, makes state Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof, a Republican from West Olive, Mich., more certain that now is the time to take up the gun legislation. Some have said it s insensitive to bring up these issues now, but I feel quite the opposite,  he told a standing-room-only crowd in the Senate Government Operations Committee.  The recent events will allow us to look at how we can deter those who want to do harm. And responsible, well-trained, licensed concealed-pistol holders can be one of those deterrents. The bills taken up in the Senate Government Operations Committee passed on a party-line vote with Republicans supporting the three-bill package and Democrats opposing it. The bills also would close the open-carry loophole, effectively barring gun owners from openly carrying their weapons in gun-free zones.He gained support from gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association and the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners. The idea of having the ability to arm a well-qualified, well-trained individual is tantamount to setting out a scenario where we no longer set up a sheep for the wolf,  said Robert Rudowski of the gun owners group.Gun-free zones should be called  mass murderer empowerment zones,  said Steve Dulan, spokesman for the gun owners group.Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, vetoed similar legislation in 2012, just four days after a horrific shooting in Newtown, Conn., when a heavily armed man muscled his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 20 first-graders and six adults.Snyder said that bill had a fatal loophole that didn t allow for those institutions to opt out of the new legislation and prohibit weapons from their buildings. His spokeswoman, Anna Heaton, said Tuesday that Snyder hasn t seen the latest version of the concealed- carry bills and hadn t taken a position on them.Meekhof said he has talked with Snyder about the new legislation and that he s  not necessarily  on board with it.  USA Today Never-Trumper  Governor Rick Snyder (R), who some Republicans believe leans to the left on more than one important issue, like vetoing legislation that would require MI voters to have a valid ID in order to vote, is currently facing some serious allegations related to the Flint water crisis.WXYZ   Harvey Hollins, the man Gov. Snyder appointed to handle the Flint Water Crisis, recently testified that he told the governor about increasing lead in Flint water months before Snyder told Congress he learned about it.The testimony came during the preliminary hearing for Michigan Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyons, who is facing involuntary manslaughter and misconduct in office charges for his alleged role in the water crisis.Hollins testified that he told Snyder in July 2015 and August 2015 that there were concerns about increased lead levels in Flint s water.During congressional testimony in March 2016, Snyder testified that he didn t even learn about the dangerous levels of lead in Flint s water system until October 2015. I told the governor that we re hearing a lot more folks complaining about lead, copper, and TTHM (total trihalomethanes),  Hollins testified.We d love to hear what you think about legal gun owners being able to carry anywhere in their state?

        "text": "Members of the Los Angeles Police Department arrived at the home of Harvey Weinstein s oldest daughter on Wednesday morning for a welfare call.That visit was prompted by a call from Lily Weinstein, 22, to authorities stating that her father was suicidal according to TMZ.Weinstein and his daughter had been in a heated argument earlier that morning, which riled up the disgraced movie mogul so much that he began to flag down a random drive and demanded that the man take him away in his vehicle. You re making it worse,  Harvey allegedly screamed at his daughter, who was eventually able to get him back in the house.An LAPD source confirmed that officers responded to a call and stayed on the scene for 30 minutes after arriving around 10:30am, and that there were no arrests.Photos showed members of the force on the property early Wednesday.Weinstein, 65, was expected to be in Europe by this time, with the embattled movie mogul saying on Tuesday that he was flying off to rehab to treat his sex addiction.Weinstein had fled the house before police arrived on the scene, and by that time tensions appeared to have cooled on both sides.He was looking more polished and put together than he has in years during this very public breakdown, wearing a pair of crisp jeans, sneakers, a clean leather jacket and a slimming black top.Weinstein also trimmed up his unruly beard and got a fresh new haircut at some point just before his meltdown, which happened to be caught on tape.Harvey Weinstein's daughter made 911 call saying her father was suicidal! #TMZ pic.twitter.com/ztK4LVZozL  TMZ (@TMZ) October 11, 2017Overall, Weinstein appeared more put together than he does when he is arriving for work in New York City or walking the red carpet at the Oscars.His daughter Lily also reportedly told police soon after they arrived that despite her statement over the phone, her father was no longer a risk.Police said that they are still investigating the incident.Weinstein may now fly for Europe tonight to start treatment for his sex addiction, though that claim cannot be trusted in light of the statement he made on Tuesday which proved to be false.

        "text": "Donald Trump is right again! He said her e-mail was easily hacked by foreign governments. The question has recently arisen of whether there s a blackmail file on Hillary. WASHINGTON (AP)   State Department staffers wrestled for weeks in December 2010 over a serious technical problem with then-Secretary Hillary Clinton s home email server, causing them to temporarily disable security features that left the server more vulnerable to hackers, according to emails released Wednesday.Just weeks later, according to previously disclosed emails, hackers attacked the server, forcing Clinton s staff to shut it down. The next day, one of Clinton s closest aides, Huma Abedin, wrote to other high ranking staff:  Don t email hrc (Clinton) anything sensitive. I can explain more in person. The emails were released under court order Wednesday to the conservative legal advocacy group Judicial Watch, which has sued the State Department over access to public records related to the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee s service as the nation s top diplomat between 2009 and 2013.The emails, reviewed by The Associated Press, show that State Department technical staff disabled software intended to block phishing emails that could deliver dangerous viruses. They were trying urgently to resolve an apparent conflict between the server s built-in email delivery features with a version of  ScanMail for Exchange  security software from Trend Micro Inc. that had been installed on her server. Clinton has not previously described any security protections on her server.Another senior State Department official, Thomas W. Lawrence, wrote days later in an email that Abedin personally was asking for an update about the server repairs. Abedin and Clinton, who both used the private server, had complained that emails each sent to State Department employees were not being reliably received.After technical staffers turned off some security features, Lawrence cautioned in an email,  We view this as a Band-Aid and fear it s not 100 percent fully effective. Clinton s campaign has repeatedly denied there is any evidence her private email server ever was breached.On Jan. 9, 2011, a State Department IT staffer was forced to shut down Clinton s server because he believed  someone was trying to hack us.  Later that day, he wrote,  We were attacked again so I shut (the server) down for a few min. The AP reported last year that in the early morning hours of Aug. 3, 2011, Clinton received infected emails, disguised as speeding tickets from New York. The emails instructed recipients to print the attached tickets. Opening an attachment would have allowed hackers to take over control of a victim s computer.In a blistering audit released last month, the State Department s inspector general concluded that Clinton and her team ignored clear internal guidance that her email setup broke federal standards and could leave sensitive material vulnerable to hackers. Her aides twice brushed aside concerns, in one case telling technical staff  the matter was not to be discussed further,  the report said.The State Department has released more than 52,000 pages of Clinton s work-related emails, including some that have since been classified. Clinton has withheld thousands of additional emails, saying they were personal. The emails released Wednesday were not made available until after the inspector general s office published its report, and Judicial Watch asked a federal judge to force the State Department to turn them over.The FBI is also investigating whether Clinton s use of the private email server imperiled government secrets. It has recently interviewed Clinton s top aides, including former chief of staff Cheryl Mills and deputy chief of staff Abedin.Read more: AP",

        "text": "These grifters have no shame. How much more evidence do Americans need to see before they understand Hillary has no interest in our nation s security? How much more evidence do we need before the Everyday American Queen of the Clinton Crime Syndicate is sent to prison? Judicial Watch today released nearly 70 pages of State Department records that show that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan, received and sent classified information on their non-state.gov email accounts. The documents, also available on the State Department website, were obtained in response to a court order from a May 5, 2015, lawsuit filed against the State Department (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)) after it failed to respond to a March 18 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking:All emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013 using a non- state.gov  email address.The new documents show that Hillary Clinton used the clintonemail.com system to ask Huma Abedin (also on a non-state.gov email account) to print two March 2011 emails, which were sent from former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (using the moniker  aclb ) to Jake Sullivan on Sullivan s non-state.gov email account. The Obama State Department redacted the Blair emails under Exemption (b)(1) which allows the withholding of classified material. The material is marked as being classified as  Foreign government information  and  foreign relations or foreign activities of the US, including confidential sources. Another email shows that Clinton wanted to know how meetings in Washington, including a four-hour meeting concerning America s war on Libya, would impact her Hampton vacation. Responding to an email that details the sensitive meetings in DC, Clinton emails Abedin on August 26, 2011,  Ok. What time would I get back to Hamptons?  Again, this email discussion takes place on non-state.gov email accounts.The documents also include advice to Clinton on Libya from Sidney Blumenthal, a Clinton Foundation employee who, according to a Judicial Watch investigative report, also had business interests in Libya. Clinton wanted Blumenthal s March 9, 2011, Libya memo to be printed  without any identifiers. The newly released Abedin emails include a lengthy exchange giving precise details of Clinton s schedule using unsecured government emails. The email from Lona J. Valmoro, former Special Assistant to Secretary of State Clinton, to Abedin and Clinton reveals exact times (including driving times) and locations of all appointments throughout the day. Another itinerary email provides details about a meeting at the United Nations in New York at 3:00 on Tuesday, January 31, 2012, with the precise disclosure,  that would mean wheels up from Andrews at approximately 12:00pm/12:15pm. These emails show that Hillary Clinton isn t the only Obama official who should be worried about being prosecuted for mishandling classified information. Her former top State aides (and current campaign advisers) Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan should be in the dock, as well,  said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.  The Obama State Department has now confirmed that Clinton, Abedin, and Sullivan used unsecured, non-government email accounts to communicate information that should now be withheld from the American people  in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, and properly classified.  When can we expect the indictments?  Via: Judicial Watch",

        "text": "Widely hailed as  the most beautiful girl in the world,  10-year-old Kristina Pimenova is no ordinary child, not by any measure of the word. She has already appeared in photographs by heavyweights in the modeling industry such as Vogue Italia, Dolce & Gabbana, Robert Cavalli, Armani, and others. She also just landed a lucrative contract by the ultra-prestigious agency LA Models, and will be relocating to Los Angeles to further her modeling career at a faster pace than probably any child ever has before.On Instagram Kristina has over 1.2 million followers, and on Facebook she s fast approaching 4 million. But, with success, comes consequences. Already Kristina is being objectified by grown men claiming among other things, that they ll be  waiting  for her. Considering her tagline is  Remember beauty is inside,  it doesn t appear everyone is that deserving.Last year her mother was accused of posting  provocative  and  sexualized  photos of little Kristina, but her mother Glikeriya Pimenova says such accusations are baseless. If anything, people were  paedophiles  if they think her photos made her look like a  babe.  We d have to agree with her. It s not uncommon to go to a swimming pool and see little girls swimming in their bathing suits, or wearing things that little girls simply wear. This is just another example of men accusing beautiful women of being at fault, merely because they find them attractive.It s pretty sick and it s this type of double standard that men have that really needs to be called out   especially because this is a child. Kristina is only ten-years-old and already getting the kind of attention normally reserved for adult women, and it s only going to get worse from here. That s why society needs to be aware of it, and men need to know it s not okay. Let a 10-year-old girl be a kid. Be aware of your inner prejudices that are prone to attack or vilify simply because of your own inner issues, not theirs.#kristinapimenovaA photo posted by Kristina Pimenova (@kristinapimenova2005) on Jun 7, 2015 at 7:35pm PDTPic via Instagram.Pic via InstagramKristina is now represented by @lamodels and @newyorkmodels A photo posted by Kristina Pimenova (@kristinapimenova2005) on Feb 3, 2016 at 10:24am PST#portosbakery we love this place A photo posted by Kristina Pimenova (@kristinapimenova2005) on Nov 25, 2015 at 4:09pm PSTWhile we will admit, adults need to be careful of what images they upload of their children, it s not her fault she s beautiful.Featured image from Instagram.",

        "text": "Speculation about Vice-President Mike Pence s political aspirations to position himself in Trump s Oval Office chair will likely get another jolt after it was reported that he tapped campaign operative, Nick Ayers, to be his chief of staff.Ayers spent months quietly bending Pence s ear to warn him that Donald Trump s troubles could cause collateral damage and that he needed to take a more aggressive position on a range of issues in order to ensure that he enters the post-Trump era on solid ground, according to two White House officials, Politico reports.There s been a lot of speculation that Pence will run in 2020 if Trump cannot, considering that his boss is plagued with scandals while only on the job for 7 months. Even political satirist Andy Horowitz wrote a piece titled,  Mike Pence considering running for president in 1820. But, President Pence emphatically denied the possibility of a 2020 run.In a statement released by the White House, Pence said Sunday s story in The New York Times  is disgraceful and offensive to me, my family, and our entire team.  He added that  the allegations in this article are categorically false. However, just before Anthony Scarmucci was kicked of Trump Island as the White House communications director, he suggested to New Yorker writer Ryan Lizza that the Vice-President can t believe what s going on with his boss. Why do you think Nick s there, bro?  Scaramucci told Lizza in an interview last month, shortly before being fired.  Are you stupid? Why is Nick there? Nick s there to protect the Vice-President because the Vice-President can t believe what the f*ck is going on. On top of that, Pence is headed to Latin America after requesting to secure 700 visas for his team.A diplomatic source called the number of visas  curious  because it dwarfed even the advance teams for President Barack Obama s trip to Brazil, Chile and El Salvador combined in 2011.But yeah, he s totally not preparing to sit in the Oval Office. Nope. Not at all. How long will it take before Trump lashes out at his Vice-President? We re pretty sure he cannot fire Pence. Another question: How much does/did Pence know about the Russia scandal as it happened? He might be a bigoted jerkface but he s not stupid.Whatever you do, do NOT tweet Donald Trump to ask about President Pence. That would be wrong and we never do wrong things here.Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",

        "text": "The first shot against PC tyranny in Virginia has been fired!Earlier this year, after racist terrorist Dylann Storm Roof was charged with shooting nine black people in a Charleston, South Carolina, church, the media and Democrats across the nation embarked on a crusade to wipe the Confederate flag from society.One of the crusaders, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, decided to get rid of license plates containing the Confederate flag altogether and informed those with such license plates that they had until October to hand the license plates over to the Department of Motor Vehicles.Those found driving with the plates will be charged with a misdemeanor.On Friday, local station WAVY reported that the vast majority of citizens with such license plates have refused to comply with the government s flag-recall notice. The DMV stated that just 187 Virginians had returned their license plates out of 1,600 who had received a recall notice.One of those who has refused to heed the call is Kevin Collier, commander of the Stonewall Camp of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, whose great-great-great-grandfather fought with the Confederacy.  Next thing you know, they re going to say you can t wear blue on Monday  or you can t wear yellow on Thursday,  he told WAVY.  Where s it going to end? The answer: It isn t. In forwarding the regulation, McAuliffe said the Confederate flag was  unnecessarily divisive and hurtful.  He added,  Even its display on state-issued license tags is, in my view, unnecessarily divisive and hurtful to too many of our people.  Apparently, McAuliffe missed the fact that the victims in Charleston did not suffer from hurt feelings thanks to license plates, but from murder at the hands of a racist renegade criminal. But government s job is now to protect feelings rather than lives. Via: Breitbart News",

        "text": "Cliven Bundy and his unstable group of family and followers have been refreshingly quiet in recent months in the aftermath of their ill-conceived hijacking of an Oregon wildlife refuge and subsequent arrests. It s hard to  occupy  anything behind bars except, perhaps, a 6 10 slab of concrete. However, Cliven is already jonesing for yet another stand-off   and as his mental state deteriorates, the risk of danger grows.Bundy, currently jailed for his instigation of the previous armed standoff in 2014, has hooked up with crazed anti-Obama right-wing  lawyer  Larry Klayman, who has filed lawsuits against people ranging from Obama to Iran s Supreme Leader to, as the Southern Poverty Law Center points out,  his own mother.  The pair   which a judge ruled couldn t legally work together, but appear to be doing so anyway   have concocted a new lawsuit claiming Sen. Harry Reid and President Obama sent  federal storm-troopers  to attack what they referred to as a gathering of  peaceful cowboys. Peaceful. Cowboys.Other parts of the lawsuit include accusations that Reid wants to sell the land to the Chinese and that the judge in the case should recuse herself because she s Latino.But even more troubling than the frivolous lawsuit is the fact that the Bundy family has made no secret about wanting to kickstart yet another showdown with federal agents. The Bundy family is still illegally grazing their cattle on federal lands, and the Bureau of Land Management is getting pretty fed up with it. Environmental groups are also urging the BLM to act, because Bundy s cattle   often times half-starved and neglected   are destroying the wildlife in what was meant to be protected land.Angie Bundy, wife of the currently locked up Ryan, said her husband and his family being locked up is a conspiracy to make it easier to seize their land. In response, she said she and the family are prepared to face another standoff. She even sees a silver lining in the men being locked up. Putting women and children in danger, she reasoned, would encourage other  patriots  to join the cause. Just like last time, they plan on using children as shields. We re not afraid,  Angie added.  If you have a bunch of women and children standing out there and protesting, it ll probably get more people out. What started as an inane property dispute over one man s right to ignore the law and enrich himself at the expense of the American taxpayer has increasingly become a sad spiral into some of the most toxic right-wing conspiracy theories around. The heavily armed  patriots  that flock to Bundy s side whenever he feels like pointing some guns at federal agents have detached themselves from reality. They quite literally believe they are at war with the United States government, and that means the odds that they react violently has skyrocketed. A third standoff almost guarantees tragedy   and the Bundys are rushing headlong into it.Featured image via David Becker/Getty Images",

        "text": "Brigitte Gabriel is a Christian who, after being terrorized by Muslim extremists in her homeland of Lebanon, fled to the US with her family. Gabriel, the president and founder of ACT for America, travels around the nation delivering a message to everyday Americans about the radical infiltration of Muslim extremists in America. She explains in easy to understand terms how the Muslim Brotherhood has one goal: to sabotage America from within, and to make Islam the dominant religion of the country.Watch Brigitte Gabriel explain the Muslim Brotherhood s plan for the destruction of the United States: The most important page of this document is the last page. Because in the last past, they list 29 Islamic organizations set up  in the United States with the specific goal of sabotaging America from within, and destroying America by our own hands. The MSA is listed as one of the Islam organizations whose goal it is to destroy America. The MSA, or Muslim Student Association has more chapters on American  college campuses than the Republican and Democrat Party combined. Watch here:The tolerance for the funding of terror groups by Americans is about to come to end under President Donald J. Trump. One of the first actions he may take is to designate what many experts have been calling a terror group for years. The Trump administration could soon declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, a move that would greatly restrict the controversial group s global reach and would come despite its insistence that it has peaceful intentions.Trump himself was often critical of President Obama s outreach to the Muslim Brotherhood, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has proposed a bill to call for declaring the Brotherhood a terror organization. In the past, it has been accused of supporting terrorist groups around the world, and several countries, including Muslim nations, have banned them.If the U.S. declares the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, it would make it a criminal act for Americans to fund the group, ban banks from processing money for it, bar people with ties to the group from coming to the United States and make it easier to deport immigrants who have worked with the organization. It is time to call this enemy by its name and speak with clarity and moral authority,  Cruz said in a statement introducing the bill. Watch Brigitte Gabriel destroy this Imam on Judge Jeanine s FOX News show: FOX NewsThe Left doesn t think Trump should designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and here s why:The New York Times editorial board thinks President Trump shouldn t designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization because it could make Trump the enemy of all Muslims.The liberal paper published Thursday an editorial Thursday titled  All of Islam Isn t the Enemy  arguing against the move, which the Trump administration is reportedly considering as a possible option. CIA Director Mike Pompeo has said he supports designating the group, which is open about its goal of creating a state ruled by Islamic law, as a terrorist organization. Is President Trump trying to make enemies of the entire Muslim world? That could well happen if he follows up his primitive ban on refugees and visa holders from seven Muslim nations with an order designating the Muslim Brotherhood   perhaps the most influential Islamist group in the Middle East   as a terrorist organization,  the editors charged.

        "text": "Donald Trump s White House is the leakiest in living memory. This is because the people around him understand that he is incompetent and never should have been president in the first place. They simply work there to hold things together, not because they like it. Working for Donald Trump is the hardest job in Washington these days. To make that worse, Trump is increasingly volatile due to the fact that he now realizes just how much trouble he could be in over the Special Counsel investigation into Russia.When a Trump adviser was interviewed for a Politico article on the Russia scandal and Trump s flirtation with ordering the firing of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, naturally at one point a comparison to President Richard Nixon s  Saturday Night Massacre  was made. However, it might be Nixon s ghost that keeps Trump from doing it. It seems that the orange wannabe president is not oblivious to how Nixonian people think he is. It has also been pointed out that many lawyers in the modern day Department of Justice likely would not do Trump s bidding, no matter how many people he fired. Brian Fallon, formerly of the Obama Justice Department and the Clinton campaign says of the situation: I think the Watergate scenario would make most self-respecting lawyers loath to put themselves in the role that Bork ended up playing. Most career-minded independent lawyers that have high regard for the Justice Department as an institution would be loath to be the modern-day equivalent to Bork. An unnamed adviser to Trump says that Trump is definitely aware of what such actions would look like. From Politico:But Trump, too, is cognizant of the comparison to Nixon, according to one adviser. The president, who friends said does not enjoy living in Washington and is strained by the demanding hours of the job, is motivated to carry on because he  doesn t want to go down in history as a guy who tried and failed,  said the adviser.  He doesn t want to be the second president in history to resign. Of course he doesn t want to look like a loser to the entire nation and world. Trump only got himself elected to prove that he could do it. He never actually wanted the job, or even believed he could do it. He just wanted to prove everyone wrong and sit in the Oval Office like some kind of king, lording over everyone. However, he is quickly learning that the federal government is not the Trump Organization, and that he is not above the law. The best thing that could happen is for the whole administration to wind up in prison for treason, and we get a new election and elect someone competent to run this great nation.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",

        "text": "Trump, like George W. Bush before him, thinks a  tax holiday  on repatriated money will spur major corporations who are currently hoarding money overseas to bring that money back and invest it in America. They fail to take into account that, like other tax breaks, companies are not going to build new factories, plants, offices or stores and hire more people if consumer demand doesn t warrant it. Instead, they ll pocket the money they save in one of any number of ways, and regular Americans won t benefit one iota from it.That s what they ll do with Trump s tax holiday. This isn t speculation or conjecture, this is something to which they literally admit. Bank of America Merrill Lynch conducted a survey of more than 300 companies over the summer, asking them what they d do with all that money they bring back from overseas. Their top two responses were the following: Pay down debt, and buy back their own stocks.The idea that they d use the money for stock buybacks is especially upsetting since this is a known method for artificially driving stock prices up. Rich executives and shareholders then get even richer. Workers see no benefit from it, and the unemployed and underemployed don t see new job opportunities popping up.Literally, the whole point of this practice is to make the rich richer.When George W. did this in 2004, companies voluntarily brought over $300 million back in from overseas. $240 million went to stock buybacks. Let that sink in for a moment   80 percent of the money brought back in from overseas went to stock buybacks. Companies took advantage of that tax holiday to inflate their stock prices and get richer. There was no economic growth from that.The companies that brought back the most money actually turned right around and laid people off.Let that sink in as well.There will be no economic growth from Trump s tax break. Companies are not so broke that they can t afford to expand without some of the money they re hoarding elsewhere and protection from repatriation taxes. They don t need this money to build anything or hire new workers. This is nothing more than the government enabling companies to enrich themselves, possibly at the expense of the Americans Trump claims to love so much. The only way to spur economic growth is to help the consumer class afford to spend their money again.

And Sessions even got an inadvertent boost from Democratic Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, who in demanding the AG s resignation initially claimed she never called or met with Russia s ambassador   only for tweets to surface indicating she had, at least twice.Other former colleagues intentionally came to Sessions  defense, backing the former Alabama senator s claim he only met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in his official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I ve met with the Russian ambassador with a group, in my capacity, with a group of other senators,  Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., told CNN.  That s in my official capacity. That s nothing. That s my job. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said in a statement that he d talked to  at least twenty ambassadors in the last six weeks. It would have been very normal for Sessions, as a senator, to have talked to the Russian ambassador without discussing the election,  Blunt said.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said on MSNBC that he d met with  six ambassadors in the last five months.  Though he hadn t met with Kislyak, Cruz said he would do so without reservations.The statements of support came as other lawmakers   including the two top-ranking Democrats, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schemer   demanded Sessions  resignation.   FOX NewsWatch: ",

Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, released copies Thursday of the edits to Comey s highly scrutinized statement.WATERED DOWN LANGUAGE:One showed language was changed to describe the actions of Clinton and her colleagues as  extremely careless  as opposed to  grossly negligent.  This is a key legal distinction.Johnson, writing about his concerns in a letter Thursday to FBI Director Christopher Wray, said the original  could be read as a finding of criminality in Secretary Clinton s handling of classified material. The edited statement deleted the reference to gross negligence   a legal threshold for mishandling classified material   and instead replaced it with an exculpatory sentence,  he wrote.The original also said it was  reasonably likely  that  hostile actors  gained access to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s private email account. That was later changed to say that scenario was merely  possible. The final statement also removed a reference to the  sheer volume  of classified information discussed on email. While the precise dates of the edits and identities of the editors are not apparent from the documents, the edits appear to change the tone and substance of Director Comey s statement in at least three respects,  Johnson wrote Thursday.That includes, Johnson said,  repeated edits to reduce Secretary Clinton s culpability in mishandling classified information.

That statement is hard to write, harder to say, and the idea of Trump becoming the most powerful man in the world is the hardest to fathom. That s because Trump is textbook demagogy at its finest and he is decisive and narcissistic.Trump doesn t want to be president to help America. Proof for that statement is the fact that his call for violence, his racism, and his divisive nature have already hurt America. Rather, Trump wants to be president so he can be called president.Mark Fiore sums up Trump s demagogy very well in his new cartoon. He said:  I m not saying he s Hitler or anything, but there is definitely something chilling about his cadence, his toying with demagoguery and longing for the days when we could sic the dogs on protestors and be done with these unseemly interruptions. This used to be funny but is now getting a little too close for comfort. (Although tactically, this may be the best thing for a more reasonable alternative because people in the United States would never vote for this guy for real, right? Right?)

        "text": "On Tuesday, Bernie Sanders slammed New York s closed primary system after a frustrated voter vented to him about not being able to vote.The voter, 21-year-old Mike Cantalupo of Massapequa, New York, went up to Sanders and explained how the system had not only confused, but ultimately failed him. Cantalupo said that he d been trying to enroll as a Democrat since last spring, but couldn t succeed because he was told that by the Department of Motor Vehicles that his paperwork was lost. Then, when he tried to register again in December, he was told that the deadline for a change-of-party in New York had passed (the deadline is October). Despite all of his efforts, he couldn t change his registration and was ultimately prevented from casting his ballot. He told Sanders: New York has terrible voting laws. Right now I m trying to do everything I can to get my vote cast for [Sanders]. I can sign a court order and an affidavit and whatever I need to do, and I m going to do that, but it shouldn t be this hard to vote. Sanders heard Cantalupo s concerns and nodded. He agreed that  No, it should not be  this hard for people to vote. He added: Today, 3 million people in the state of New York who are independents have lost their right to vote in the Democratic or Republican primary. That s wrong. You re paying for this election; it s administered by the state, [and] you have a right to vote. That s a very unfortunate thing that I hope will change in the future. You can watch Cantalupo s conversation with Sanders below:WATCH: @BernieSanders tells independent voter by Times Square:  You have a right to vote  https://t.co/1dXt1G3Cauhttps://t.co/PztjYBywWU  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) April 19, 2016Because of these issues, 3 million people that are registered outside of Republican or Democratic parties may not be able to vote in the primary. Jose Ruiz, a polling site coordinator, estimated  I d say 30% are not registered, even though they thought they were. And it wasn t just registration that voting New Yorkers had trouble with. In other cases, polling places were moved without adequately notifying voters, and some polling sites were set up hours later than their scheduled time.Despite all of the issues and setbacks, Sanders is still hopeful. Continuing to bash the primary problems that voters are now referring to as  sabotage,  Sanders said: We re feeling very good. If there is a large voter turnout   despite the impediment of 3 million people not being able to participate   I think we re going to do just fine. Compared to the rest of the United States, New York is generally low in voter participation regardless of whether it s a local or national election. Open primary states, or those with same-day registration, have much higher turnouts.Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images",

The fun Scott seemed to be having abruptly ended when Scarborough asked him one simple question: Would you tell your friend Donald Trump that he should walk back his statements that Muslims, that Islam, hates America? Do you think Muslims in the state of Florida hate America? Scarborough was referencing Trump s recent statement that Muslims hate America. Not only did Rick Scott refuse to refute Trump s statement, but he dodged the question multiple times, talking about how great his state is in terms of being a melting pot and other stupid statements. Scarborough pressed Scott again: I want you to answer the question! Do you personally think that Islam is a religion that hates America? Scott again refused to answer the question with more red herrings and continued to talk more about his state.   No, no. That s not answering any questions,  jumped in co-host  Mika Brzezinski. She then cut him down, had his mic shut off and when Rick Scott attempted to speak again, it became clear his mic had been shut off. Back from commercial, Brzezinski stated to the viewers,  That s just not what we do on our show. It was an amazing display of a journalist taking control of an interview. More importantly, Brzezinski sent a message that refusing to condemn hate speech is no different than actually spewing it when she kicked this idiot off the show.Watch Here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI-gLvJePlQ] Featured image via video screenshot.",

The lawmakers who refuse to lock down our borders and stiffen the penalties for human traffickers who bring illegal aliens into the U.S. should also be held accountable by their constituents Eight people were found dead in a tractor-trailer outside a Walmart store in the stifling summer heat in what police called a horrific human trafficking case, and the driver was arrested.Several other people, possibly dozens, were found in the truck, which didn t have a working air conditioning system despite blistering temperatures that topped 100 degrees, and they were taken to hospitals, authorities said. The driver had been held, authorities said, but they didn t release the driver s identity.A person from the truck approached a Walmart employee in a parking lot and asked for water late Saturday night or early Sunday morning, said police in San Antonio, where temperatures on Saturday reached 101 degrees. The employee gave the person the water and then called police, and when officers arrived they found the eight people dead in the back of the trailer, police Chief William McManus said.Investigators checked store surveillance video, which showed vehicles had arrived and picked up other people from the tractor-trailer, police said. We re looking at a human trafficking crime this evening,  McManus said.He called the case  a horrific tragedy. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was involved in the investigation into what happened, he said.The National Weather Service s local office said the temperature in San Antonio hit 101 degrees just before 5 p.m. Saturday and didn t dip below 90 degrees until after 10 p.m.Other cases of human trafficking in the United States have led to more deaths. In May 2003, 19 immigrants being transported from South Texas to Houston died inside a sweltering tractor-trailer.Prosecutors said the driver in the 2003 case heard the immigrants begging and screaming for their lives as they were succumbing to the stifling heat inside his truck but refused to free them. The driver was resentenced in 2011 to nearly 34 years in prison after a federal appeals court overturned the multiple life sentences he had received.  NYPMany of the human trafficking cases are related to human traffickers bringing illegal aliens into the United States:Jalopnik   In July 2013, Authorities in Mexico charged a truck driver with human trafficking after discovering 94 people in his vehicle headed to the United States.A report from Reuters says that the 94 people packed into a truck were found near the southern city of Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of the state of Chiapas. Among them were 19 people from Bangladesh and Nepal, as well as Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. They were detected in an X-ray scan Monday night outside Tuxtla Gutierrez.Officials say the migrants were kept in inhumane conditions.

To start a global war on terror and not explain how 9/11 occurred, or how a third building collapsed nine hours later, doesn t make sense.Obama s sudden appearance on the scene, doesn t make sense.The hundreds of books and articles that question the mechanism of the selection of Obama and never discussing them on the mainstream media, doesn t make sense.Obama placed in that position by the establishment, by the deep state, doesn t make sense.The blanked out middle-class of America, still pondering what happened, doesn t make sense.The fact that they lost their jobs beginning three decades ago, and having had to let go of their comfortable insured life working in an American factory, doesn t make sense.The abandoned factories and grand industries that once made America great, lying obsolete and deserted, doesn t make sense.Half of Detroit abandoned and deserted, doesn t make sense.The media cheering on its hallucinatory concussions all throughout these disasters, doesn t make sense.The PTSD ed war veterans and the official suicide rates of US soldiers on and off duty, go undetected and barely seen in the rear view mirror of the media, never make sense.All the common man sees today is one man attacked by the same mass  media that pushed them into the illegal wars and illegitimate debts from zero to $20 trillion, between 1979-2017, by some estimates.But the  buck stops here  as President Eisenhower once famously said. The heavy train loaded with old rusted debris is coming to a screeching halt. Meanwhile the curious are looking wide-eyed. NATO doesn t know where it really stands.  The think tanks of Washington   the hub of all mesmerizing strategies   are vacant, or their curtains half drawn. The Neocons are contemplating plan B. The  Israeli firsters  are caught off guard. They are planning ahead of time desperately. But whose ears do they have this time?! A man who calls the weapons of the think tanks, the mainstream media,  liars  ,  fake news !?Once the invisible sword, the likes of New York Times and CNN are today exposed and blunted. Who dared call CNN  liars ?! CNN engaged America meticulously into two  fake  wars which indebted the United States, and still avoided any blame. It was almost scripted and storyboarded like a Hollywood movie. Now, it is still loose, with acrobatic skills evading all detection like a skilled serial killer breathing in our civilized world.Now the eye-opening process has begun. Watch out for the six-packers and their evaporated illusions! You have finally awaken the slumbering slave of America, and awakened they are Alas! All empires go through these stages.  The awkward moments must be tolerated i.e. the president without a cabinet, the supporters with semi-automatic weapons guarding his speeches in Georgia and Florida. The anti-Semitic accusations that are being discussed in the morning regular sessions on CNN. The angry obliterated Alan Dershowitz who is nervously accusing CNN s moderator Don Lemon, of giving the anti-Semites their fifteen minutes of fame. They fear that it will catch fire on the colleges and universities.The masquerade however is over. The Paul Wolfowitzs, the Richard Perles, the Daniel Pipes have to face the masses. The not-so-innocent masses that succumbed to the beast s demands also wait. The confrontation lingers silently.  No one even knows these people  as Thomas Friedman of the New York Times once famously said in his interviews with the Haaretz. Twenty Five Neocons have planned and executed what has happened in the past two and a half decades.The wakeup call has rung, the moment of illusion has disappeared. The apparent, sudden sun is beginning to shine gloriously, one ray at a time. Wash your face and watch the unfolding.21WIRE contributor Nader Talebzadeh is an Iranian filmmaker, producer, writer, cultural and historical commentator and New Horizon Conference Chair, Channel One TV program host  A sr  (The Time ).

        "text": "The Iowa caucuses have come and gone, leaving in their wake a trail of fallen candidates no longer willing to have their dignity handed to them by the likes of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Not that Republicans have any actual dignity, so let s just go with the idea that they re tired of being embarrassed.Who can blame them? Mike Huckabee was the first to fall, joking that it wasn t due to low votes but to illness.  The voters are sick of me,  said the Huckster. Waka waka. Buh bye. Rand Paul went down in flames shortly thereafter, deciding to make sure he doesn t lose his senate seat instead, which is a valid concern.For the Democrats, Martin O malley dropped out, which comes as no surprise to anyone.That leaves the two major contenders for the Democrats and a still ridiculously large field of horrible governors, senators who don t bother voting and a few non-politician types who don t understand the first thing about how the real world works.Even with the dropouts and a Cruz victory proving devastating to Donald Trump, the real loser of the Iowa caucuses was Jeb Bush, who outspent every by dropping more than $12 million and walking away with votes in the single digits. None of the  establishment  favorites fared well with the exception of Marco Rubio, who stepped up in the absence of Donald Trump at the last Fox News debate and screamed at America every time he was given the chance.It s a circus for sure. Luckily, we have people like Stephen Colbert who know how to take the ridiculously irritating Republican field and turn them into the buffoons they are for our enjoyment. Stephen dons his Hunger Games attire, which includes eyebrows that his  forehead can t contain,  and spends a few minutes making asinine asshats look even worse than they already do.Watch Stephen Colbert lambaste the  fallen tributes  In this hilarious clip:Featured image from screen capture",

        "text": "The entitled refugee mentality is becoming the norm in bleeding heart nations around the world. We recently reported about complaints from Italian citizens that refugees were dumping garbage in the streets of Italy to protest poor wi-fi. In Germany, an Afghan family refused to get off the bus at their new government funded flat, after complaining they were promised a home.Immigrant Services Association of Nova Scotia says staff thoroughly inspected an apartment to ensure it was bedbug-free before moving in a family of six Syrian refugees on Feb. 1.Director of operations Gerry Mills said families are moved into safe and appropriate housing, and ISANS staff keep the health and well-being of refugees in mind. Our staff know what bedbugs look like and since Friday we ve had staff there every day in different apartments, honestly trying to look for bedbugs. We have found not one bedbug,  she said.On Tuesday, Ziad Zeina told CBC News through an interpreter that he wanted to get his family out of their two-bedroom apartment on Gerrish Street because the bedbug problem  is non-stop and it s not going to change and there s no solution at this moment. But Mills said one of the first steps workers take is to inquire with building managers whether the biting pests are a problem on site.In the case of Harbour View Apartments where the Zeinas live, Mills said building managers took the preventive step of fumigating their unit even though it did not have bedbugs. You can actually tell because there s still kind of an actual vague smell in them [apartments],  Mills said.Or was it a pre-existing skin condition?Wafaa Al Safadi holds her 10-month-old son, Rayan Zeina. She says he is covered in bed bug bites. (Elizabeth Chiu/CBC)The Zeinas are government-assisted refugees who stayed briefly in Charlottetown and decided to settle in Halifax at the end of January.The family insists there s a bedbug issue and Wafaa Al Safadi lifted her baby s shirt to reveal his chest and back covered in scabs and red rashes.But Mills said the baby has a pre-existing skin condition. The marks were on the child even before they moved into that apartment. When they were in the hotel, we spoke with the family then about taking the child to the doctor to get some medication. ISANS said there are 16 families of Syrian refugees living in the same building and no other families have complained about the blood-sucking insects. Via: CBC ",

        "title": " WATCH: Donald Trump Explains His New Muslim Ban \u2018Expansion\u2019 Plan",
        "text": "Donald Trump and the GOP appear to have finally found the messaging that they are using to sell Trump s flip-flop on banning Muslims from entering the United States.During an interview on MSNBC s Meet the Press Sunday morning, Trump told the Chuck Todd that he doesn t consider his recent changes to his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States a  rollback. I actually don t think it s a rollback. In fact, you could say it s an expansion. I m looking now at territory,  Trump told Todd.  People were so upset when I used the word Muslim. Oh, you can t use the word Muslim. Remember this. And I m okay with that, because I m talking territory instead of Muslim. We re going to have tough standards,  Trump went on to say.  And if a person can t prove   that they re from an area, and if a person can t prove what they have to be able to prove, they re not coming into this country. And I would stop the Syrian migration and a Syrian from coming into this country in two seconds. Let s be clear, Trump s proposal is a rollback. His initial call for a unilateral ban on Muslims entering the United States is both incredibly bigoted and unconstitutional. It also happens to be impossible to enforce and would severely damage the United States  reputation. Even if Trump were to become president, it is hard to see how such a proposal would actually be implemented.That s why this rollbacked version of his proposal is actually far worse. That s because it can actually be implemented. While still divisive among the GOP, Trump would have far more support for his modified approval. More than half of the governors in the United States want to ban Syrians from entering the United States as of last year. There are even a few Democrats who would jump on board the xenophobia train.So, yes  this is a rollback. It s also an  expansion  as Trump refers to it, in the sense that it is something that could actually become policy.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhpwEO7b7eoFeatured image via video screenshot",

        "text": "In the world of politics there are going to be scandals. It s just a fact. There s no way around it. They can be true or they can be false, but they are going to happen no matter who you are. What s important, however, is how one handles the scandals, and so far Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has shown that he can t handle much of anything thrown his way.With The National Enquirer printing a story that alleges Cruz s involved with five different women other than his wife, #CruzSexScandal quickly started to take over social media and the national conversation. Is the story true? Who knows, really. But at this point it doesn t really matter, because it s out there.Now, Cruz could simply shrug off these allegations, or even laugh at them for how ridiculous they may be, but instead he chose to throw a ginormous hissy fit on Facebook and blames the entire thing on Donald Trump. And who knows, maybe Trump is to blame. However, how Cruz is handling all of this shows how he may handle times of trouble, and let s just say, it ain t pretty.Cruz wrote on Facebook: I want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage. For Donald J. Trump to enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald won t go.These smears are completely false, they re offensive to Heidi and me, they re offensive to our daughters, and they re offensive to everyone Donald continues to personally attack.Donald Trump s consistently disgraceful behavior is beneath the office we are seeking and we are not going to follow. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;I want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage.

If the story from The National Enquirer is false, it will simply drift away over the course of the 24-hour news cycle. Drawing further attention to it, and acting SO defensive doesn t necessarily make you look guilty, but it also doesn t make you look good. It s a tabloid paper that will also talk about people giving birth to aliens and/ or maybe the Queen of England taking up heroin  it s not like it was printed in the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal. Simmer down now. Stuff like this is inevitably going to come up, true or not. For goodness sake, ask a Clinton.If this is how he handles ridiculous stories about himself, how the hell is he going to handle being Commander-in-Chief?

        "title": " Trump Is Already Mulling His Cabinet Picks And It\u2019s Clear He Has No Idea What He\u2019s Doing",
        "text": "Now that he s president-elect, Donald Trump has begun turning his attention to his transition, as well as beginning to build up his cabinet. It s early right now, but sources have told Politico who is in line for some top positions. If you weren t already panicking just from his win last night, now would be a good time to start.Perhaps most alarming are his potential picks for Secretary of DHS. Politico reports that Sheriff David Clarke is said to be a major contender. This is the Milwaukee sheriff who made a name for himself calling for  pitchforks and torches  and armed rebellion if Trump lost.But he seems to be the main contender, not the sole contender. There s also a possibility that Bridgegate Kingpin Chris Christie could be in line for the position, as could Rudy Giuliani. Putting either of these people in charge of agencies like U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and more, could potentially be very damaging.For Secretary of State, we have John Bolton, former U.N. ambassador and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Bolton was a controversial figure at the U.N., and he championed George W. Bush s insistence on one-sided foreign policy. Fan-bloody-tastic.Newt Gingrich could also be in line for this position, as could Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee.Trump is rumored to want to put his own finance chief, who s a former Goldman-Sachs exec, in as Secretary of the Treasury. Besides the blatant cronyism, a Wall Street executive in a cabinet position goes against everything Trump claimed about Hillary and her ties to the banks.Rudy Giuliani is rumored to be considered for a host of positions, including Attorney General, White House Chief of Staff, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of National Intelligence/CIA Director. Giuliani is about as erratic and unreasonable as Trump   the most benign position in this list is probably Chief of Staff.Chris Christie may also be up for Attorney General.Trump s top pick for Secretary of Energy is Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm. This guy has shaped a lot of Trump s ideas on energy policy, which includes gutting renewable energy and escalating fossil fuel use.For Secretary of the Interior, the leading candidate right now is Forrest Lucas, the founder of Lucas Oil. An oil executive and a vocal animal rights opponent is such a great pick to protect our lands and our wildlife. We can probably say goodbye to national parks, the endangered species list, and more if he s chosen.Other candidates include none other than Queen Drunken Airhead herself, Sarah Palin, as well as Trump s own son, Donald Trump Jr. No nepotism there at all.Trump wants a business leader, a.k.a. a CEO, for Labor Secretary. Interestingly enough, though, the current commissioner of the EEOC, Victoria Lipnic, is said to be a frontrunner for this job. She s one of Obama s picks and supports things like the Equal Pay Act. She wants to get rid of the EEOC s pay data collection system, though.Trump said early on that he wanted to eliminate the EPA, but has since modified that position. However, he wants to put noted climate skeptic Myron Ebell in charge of the agency responsible for ensuring we have clean air and clean water, so he might as well eliminate it.Ben Carson.  Nuff said.Politico has their full list, and CNN also has a list. It s very early yet, and it s true that not every single person Trump is considering would be a bad choice. For instance, he wants someone who s already got a lot of experience with Veterans  Affairs to head up the VA. However, many of his potential picks are rampant with cronyism and just plain sheer idiocy and cluelessness.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",

I heard Melissa go into to the living room, and I went in there to talk to her,  Terry Boarts told the Montgomery Observer.  She was gone. She had left. Boarts  mother says the 36-year-old Alabama woman was diagnosed with bipolar manic depression. She was having trouble with her medication and had scheduled an appointment with her doctors in hopes of finding a more effective medication.On Sunday, before disappearing, she told family members she was going to kill herself by slitting her wrists.When Terry Boarts finally located her daughter, she says she was driving on the Interstate,  heading toward Auburn. Not knowing what else to do, Terry Boarts called 911. She says she told the dispatch operator that her daughter was  having mental issues  that she was bipolar, that she had been really depressed, that she was saying she was going to cut her wrists. According to attorneys representing the Boarts family, Melissa Boarts was 5 4 and weighed about 130 lbs.After pursuing her vehicle down a dirt road, police say that the mentally-ill woman got out of her vehicle and charged at them with a weapon.Police say that the officer on scene felt threatened and feared for his life. He fired his police-issued weapon, ending her life.Terry Boarts says that the family was initially not given any information from officers, beyond being told that there was  fatality. We re still assuming the road ended and she hit a tree,  Terry Boarts told the Montgomery Observer.  They never told us she had been shot. Melinda Boarts, Melissa Boarts  twin sister, said police finally came back after hours, to tell the family  they shot her. Melissa Boarts  family is shocked and outraged over her death at the hands of the people they trusted to help her in a time of need.Her father spent 25 years working for the Alabama Department of Corrections. There was absolutely no justification for it,  he said in a statement released through the family s attorney.  (Police officers) knew exactly what was going on. That s why we can t understand why they had to shoot her,  he told the Montgomery Observer, calling the shooting  absolutely outrageous. Auburn police have refused to say whether there is video or audio from the scene of the shooting, but promised to make all evidence public, once it becomes available.As The Washington Post reports here, there have been 262 fatal police shootings so far in 2016.A person with mental illness is 16 times more likely than others to be killed by police.Here s more on this story from Alabama s WRBL.

        "text": "Bernie Sanders and his supporters just received some excellent news concerning the mix up that might have prevented his name from being on the ballot in Washington, D.C.Anita Bonds, chairwoman of the Washington, D.C. Democratic Party told CNN that  Bernie will be on the ballot. Sanders  supporters were dismayed to hear that the Democratic presidential candidate might not be on the ballot. On Wednesday, NBC4 Washington reported that D.C. Democrats had failed to send Sanders  campaign information to the D.C. Board of Elections until one day after the registration was due.Headlines proclaiming that Sanders may not be on the ballot in the upcoming D.C. primary election may have given some of Sanders  supporters heart attacks. However, Sanders campaign did not seem to be concerned about the possibility of his name not being on the ballot come June 14, the day of D.C s primary election. We did what the D.C. law requires in order to get Bernie on the ballot and we are confident he will be on the ballot,  a spokesman with the Sanders campaign said.Sanders campaign had already paid $2500 in registration fees and gave his registration filings to the D.C. Democratic Party earlier this month.It turns out that the Board of Elections closes before the deadline. So it is common to turn in the registration filings the day after the deadline. This has been kind of a tradition in the District of Columbia, that the party would notify the board the following day,  Bonds told CNN.What s unusual about the potentially campaign dooming mix-up, is that Sanders was actually challenged on the matter. The challenge to Sanders  campaign came from a voter who lives in D.C. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Rocky De La Fuente, who had also paid their registration fees on time, were challenged.Bonds is working to rectify the current situation. In addition to her position as the chairperson of the D.C Democratic Party, she also serves on the city council. She plans to change the city s rules to include a 24-hour grace period after the registration deadline. That means Sanders is safe.While I am glad that everything has turned out okay, this time, I have to say that it might be time for D.C. Democratic Party to find a new  tradition  concerning turning in campaign registration filings.Featured image: (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",

At the same time, the proportion of Christians among the total cohort of Syrian refugees admitted into the U.S. since the conflict began five years ago has now dropped below two percent.Just 55 Christians (1.9 percent) are among the 2,769 Syrian refugees admitted since March 2011, while a large majority   2,594 (93.6 percent)   has been Sunni Muslims.Christians accounted for about 10 percent of Syria s population when the civil war began and Sunni Muslims for an estimated 74 percent.The administration has rejected calls by some Republican lawmakers, and some GOP presidential candidates, for Syrian Christians to be prioritized in the refugee admission process.Here s the truth about how these Muslim  refugees  who are coming from countries who hate are finding their way  to the United States:The ISIS terrorist attack in Paris on November 13 fueled concerns that the terrorist group was exploiting the flow of refugees and migrants as cover to send jihadists into the West to carry out attacks.French authorities said two of the attackers had been carrying fake Syrian passports and warned European Union partners that  some terrorists are trying to get into our countries and commit criminal acts by mixing in with the flow of migrants and refugees. Last Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper affirmed during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that ISIS has done so. Isn t it already proven that Mr. Baghdadi is sending people with this flow of refugees that are terrorists that   in order to inflict further attacks on Europe and the United States?  Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) asked him, referring to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. That s correct,  Clapper replied.  That s one technique they ve used is taking advantage of the torrent of migrants to insert operatives into that flow. In addition, he continued, ISIS has become  pretty skilled at [producing] phony passports, so they can travel ostensibly as legitimate travelers as well. In December, House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) said the U.S. intelligence community  has identified already individuals tied to terrorist organizations in Syria that want to exploit and get into the United States through the refugee process.

        "title": "BREAKING : Next In Line For Speaker Of The House, RINO Kevin McCarthy Makes Shocking Announcement",
        "text": "Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has dropped out of the race for House Speaker. The reason he gave to the Republican Caucus for dropping out:  I am not the right person to lead at this moment.  McCarthy was expected to win the Speakership in a landslide but his comments on Benghazi were frowned upon by his fellow Republicans. McCarthy s mistake of saying the Benghazi investigation was all about politics was exactly what Hillary Clinton needed to revive her campaign. Ultimately, he was concerned he could not get the 218 votes needed to win: McCarthy s decision, announced moments before Republicans were set to nominate their candidate, will postpone the vote for speaker. McCarthy had been running against Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Daniel Webster, R-Fla., before he dropped out, and it s unclear whether other candidates will now step forward.While McCarthy, R-Calif., faced vocal opposition from some conservative members and groups, he was thought to have more than enough support to win the party s nomination in the vote initially set for Thursday. Fox News is told McCarthy, in revealing his choice, simply told colleagues it was not his time.His withdrawal rattled fellow lawmakers, particularly allies in leadership. But addressing reporters afterward, McCarthy said he thinks the party needs a  fresh face. READ MORE: FOX NEWS",

        "text": "No threats of beheadings have been made yet  oh wait those types of threats only come from the  religion of peace  There won t be any criticisms of this piece of  art  created  specifically to mock the belief that Catholics hold about contraception by the mainstream media. No one will accuse this  artist  of asking for trouble or inciting hate or violence. Catholics will just be expected to suck it up and deal with it after all, it s just  art  and unlike Pamela Gellar, her freedom of speech and expression rights are protected under our Constitution.Milwaukee Art Museum is getting complaints from the Milwaukee archbishop, members of the public, and even some of its donors over its plans to display a huge portrait of Pope emeritus Benedict XVI. This piece is made out of 17,000 nonlubricated condoms,  artist Niki Johnson recently told WITI television in Milwaukee.  What I did was inter-stuffed them and folded them in order to create this tonal range. The portrait, titled  Eggs Benedict,  measures almost seven feet high and five feet wide, and it can be viewed from both the front and the back:  When you come to the back, you see the condoms themselves,  Johnson noted.Johnson told the WITI she decided to make the latex mosaic after Pope Benedict s visit to Africa in 2009. Benedict said condoms would not resolve the AIDS epidemic:  On the contrary, it increases the problem,  he said at the time. And I was just dumbfounded,  Johnson said.  I mean, I couldn t make any sense of that statement. And so I figured I needed to do something. Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki says the museum s decision to display the piece is insulting and callous, the Associated Press reported. Some patrons have dropped their membership, and at least one donor has ended financial support of the not-for-profit museum. This was never intended to be derisive, mocking or disrespectful of the pope,  the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel quoted museum Board of Trustees President Don Layden as saying.  It was to have a conversation about AIDS and AIDS education. And my hope is when the piece appears in the museum that will be the focus of the discussion. The museum announced the acquisition of the piece earlier this month. But it won t go on display until this fall because the museum s permanent collection galleries are currently closed for renovation.The $31-million renovation project is being done in partnership with Milwaukee County, which committed $10 million to repair and restore two of the museum s buildings.Membership is the primary source of revenue for the museum.Via: CNS News",

        "text": "Republican front runner Donald Trump has stopped events for strange reasons before   let s not forget that the business mogul once hijacked and paused an entire GOP debate, just so that he could assure America that there was  no problem with the size of his penis. He s at it again, and this time is just as bizarre.CNN had wisely decided to cover President Barack Obama s press conference with Raul Castro instead of Trump s address to the press after his meeting with Republicans in DC, but when the network turned back to Trump s press conference things got really weird. While taking questions from the audience at the construction site of the Trump International Hotel, the candidate decided to stop the show and give a woman a job interview on the spot while cameras were rolling and everyone else awkwardly looked on.The woman identified herself as a 9/11 survivor and an Iraq and Afghanistan War veteran, telling Trump: I love the policy that you have for the military. I wanted to know if Trump towers would be part of the veterans job  Trump cut the woman off and said, What are you talking about here? We are doing some of that actually already. We have it very much involved. Why what are you looking for? What kind of a position? Then Trump invited her to  come up here  on stage with him.As the woman joined him, Trump asked the crowd gathered at his soon-to-be hotel,  Do you mind if I do a job interview right now? We need good people. For this  job interview , Trump instructed the woman to tell everyone about about her experience with design and decorating. In those few seconds, Trump decided that she would be a great employee and passed her off to  the men  in charge of the building, saying that if they could negotiate a great deal on her salary, she would probably have a job in no time.You can watch this strange, impromptu interview below:WATCH: Donald Trump conducts impromptu job interview during press conference.https://t.co/KNb43kll8c  CSPAN (@cspan) March 21, 2016The interview was so weird and uncomfortable to watch, Trump got grilled by the next reporter he chose to take questions from. The reporter asked Trump why he would offer a job to a complete stranger. Trump responded: I felt good about her. I ll tell you what, I looked at her, I said she, you know, I have gut instincts, OK? And we re allowed to have that. And I looked at her and she asked a question and it was a very positive question  she just seemed like a good person to me. Featured image via Gage Skidmore",

        "title": " Legendary Investigative Journalist Carl Bernstein Confirms Trump Is A Fascist (VIDEO)",
        "text": "Veteran investigative reporter Carl Bernstein outed Donald Trump as a fascist on Sunday, and if you don t believe him just Google the definition of fascism and you ll see he s right.During an appearance on CNN, Bernstein was asked by Brian Stelter why he thinks Trump is a neo-fascist and the former Washington Post reporter who broke the Watergate scandal wide open in the 1970s obliged. It is a difficult term, and the word  neo  has a lot to do with it   meaning a new kind of fascist in our culture, dealing with an authoritarian demagogic point of view,  Bernstein began. Nativist, racist, anti-immigrant bigotry that he appeals to. I think we need to look to the past  and I m not talking about Hitlerism and genocide. I m not drawing a direct paralel to Mussolini.But it is a kind of American fascism we haven t seen before. This goes beyond George Wallace, who was merely a racist. This goes to authoritarianism and the desire for a strong man who doesn t trust the institutions and democracy and government. Bernstein then slammed the media for not examining Trump and fascism more closely during this campaign. We now need on cable news to have a debate, a historical debate on what fascism was and is and how Donald Trump fits in the picture. Because it is something very foreign to our political cutltue in terms of the 20th, 21st century. That s going on in print and online but it is not part of our debate on cable. No interviewer as far as I know has asked Donald Trump, what is fascism, Mr. Trump, how are you different from the fascist message? When asked to confirm that he is calling Trump a neo-fascist, Bernstein responded in the affirmative, pointing out that Trump incites violence at his rallies and uses a methodology similar to ones used by fascist leaders of the past, which includes nativism. Berstein also stressed that up to now he had never used the term to  describe a living American politician. Here s the video via YouTube.Bernstein isn t the first to point out that Donald Trump is acting an awful lot like a fascist.The Daily Show with Trevor Noah also perfectly demonstrated how Trump is a fascist.Fascism is  a cult of action, celebrating aggressive masculinity, fear of outsiders, intense nationalism, intolerance of criticism, and resentment of national humiliation  Noah and the Daily Show team discovered.  I m shitting myself,  Noah remarked.  It all lines up so perfectly, doesn t it? It almost stops being funny as you re watching it. And even actor George Clooney called Trump a fascist during an interview with The Guardian earlier this month.And quite frankly, Bernstein, Noah, and Clooney are all correct when they say Donald Trump is a fascist. For months, Trump has viciously attacked immigrants and journalists while bragging about his masculinity and how America needs to be a bully in the world. He has also adopted anti-women rhetoric and even managed to lead his supporters into pledging themselves to him with a Nazi salute that looked eerily like something out of Nazi Germany.Make no mistake, Trump is scary and he is only becoming more frightening as he moves closer to winning the Republican nomination. We could, indeed, be watching the first fascist rise to national power in the United States. Don t believe me? Just click here.And if you need any more proof, consider this. Earlier this month, a Holocaust survivor spoke up and said Trump reminded him a lot of Adolf Hitler. If that doesn t make you believe Trump is a fascist who seriously threatens our nation, nothing will. Featured image via Twitter",

        "text": "Rafeal Zuniga, a former guard at the Waller County, Texas jail where Sandra Bland died, admitted to falsifying official logs documenting the final events leading up to her death. According to the Houston Chronicle, special prosecutors were aware of the falsified documents, but a grand jury still chose not to indict any employees of the jail or sheriff s office last December in connection with the woman s death.The Houston Chronicle reports that Zuniga, a new hire at the jail, was on duty the morning Sandra Bland was found dead in her cell. During sworn testimony, Zuniga stated that he was directed by other guards to document an 8:01 am check on Bland, although he never actually checked on her at all.Although the grand jury failed to indict 12 employees of the Waller County Jail, her family has filed a wrongful death suit. The case is scheduled for trial in January of 2017. In February the suit was expanded to include Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Brian Encinia who arrested Bland, his agency, Waller County, two of the jail employees and ten Waller County officials. The suit seeks unspecified damages.While no one from the Waller County Jail was indicted on murder charges, Brian Encinia was indicted on perjury charges. The charges stem from his testimony, under oath, regarding his actions on the day Bland was arrested.Video of the encounter between Encinia and Bland, a Black Lives Matter activist, contradicts the trooper s statements under oath. Encinia testified that he ordered Bland to exit her vehicle in order to conduct a traffic investigation. The jury, which had access to the dashcam video, found Encinia s statement to be untrue.Sandra Bland supposedly hung herself with a plastic trash bag, three days after Encinia took her into custody. The 28-year-old civil rights leader was in the process of moving from the Chicago area to Texas, where she was scheduled to begin work at Prairie View A&M University. Those who were closest to her say that her spirits were good and she was excited at the prospect of her new job and life in Texas.Watch the video below, courtesy of Democracy Now.Featured image via video screen capture",

        "text": "President Obama made history yet again by making the rate for Americans without health insurance reach another historic low. However, you wouldn t know about it because virtually none of the mainstream media have talked about it on any level.Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index was updated on April 7th with new data for the first quarter of 2016. The statistics have now been released, and it shows that the uninsured rate for American adults dropped to 11 percent, which is the lowest ever recorded in the poll s history.This unmitigated success has followed a trend since the third quarter of 2013, which is the last one before the Affordable Care Act s mandate for health insurance took effect.The graph below shows the virtual bottoming out of the uninsured rate. Considering where we were as a nation only three years ago, coupled with the stubborn resistance of many in complying with the new requirements, the results are simply amazing.Not only are the results on the uninsured rate historic overall, but the largest benefits are among African-Americans, Hispanics, adults under 34 years of age, and adults making less than $36,000 per year. If Republicans really want to  repeal every word of Obamacare  as they promise to do, it would literally make their party go extinct. Young and minority voters will be lost to Republicans for a generation or more, and doom them extinction.The Republican  plan  during the 2016 election has been more of the same. Repeal, repeal, repeal   with no plan to replace as usual. However, there has been a lot less talk of repeal as of late. Even Ted Cruz, who could have  I will repeal every word of Obamacare  chiseled on his tombstone, has been strangely silent on the issue. Votes to repeal have seemed to be drying up, and you hear hardly a peep coming from Senate Republicans on the matter these days.Perhaps the GOP has finally reached the last stage of grief   acceptance.Featured image via Getty",

        "text": "Does this mean Republicans in the House are FINALLY going to start standing up for the Americans who elected them to be their representatives in Washington DC? Does this action represent the change we re all desperate to see now that Boehner is vacating his seat? House Republicans on Tuesday introduced a resolution to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, accusing him of making  false statements  under oath and failing to comply with a subpoena for evidence.In case you ve forgotten, here are two of the most powerful testimonies exposing the tyranny of our government  we have ever posted on our website:Our friend Becky Gerritson (who is currently running for a seat in our US Congress):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE4_MT8MkIAAnd then there was the powerful testimony by Founder and Chairman of True the Vote, Catherine Engelbrecht:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db21AQu30XwHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and 18 other committee members introduced the resolution to begin impeachment proceedings. In doing so, they followed through on a threat first made over the summer, when Republicans accused the IRS leader of making inaccurate statements to Congress regarding the Tea Party targeting scandal and its aftermath. Commissioner Koskinen violated the public trust,  Chaffetz said in a statement Tuesday.  He failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled. Impeachment is the appropriate tool to restore public confidence in the IRS and to protect the institutional interests of Congress. The IRS issued a statement later Thursday saying,  The IRS vigorously disputes the allegations in the resolution. We have fully cooperated with all of the investigations. The announcement of the impeachment resolution comes on the same day Koskinen testified before the Senate Finance Committee, and after the Justice Department on Friday decided to close its investigation of the targeting scandal without pursuing criminal charges.

        "text": "Donald Trump is supposed to have several important phone calls with world leaders today, amounting to what is being billed as a  day of diplomacy.  Given Trump s inexperience and impulsive statements, world leaders are especially skeptical of what his being leader of the free world (*SHUDDER*) will really mean for the world. So, one would think that he would spend his morning preparing for his calls, right? WRONG.Instead, Trump is up and tweeting, when he is, as of this writing, set to be on a call with the Prime Minister of Japan at any moment. His target? Why, the press, of course. The Washington Post and the New York Times have been on Trump s hit list for quite some time, and that thorny relationship has gotten worse, since Trump s White House is leaking like a sieve regarding his temperament and inability to do his job as president. It was the Washington Post who said Trump s team is portraying him as a  clueless child,  which of course enraged the thin-skinned sorry excuse for a  president.  To that end, Trump fired off a series of tweets doing his best to discredit those outlets:The failing @nytimes has been wrong about me from the very beginning. Said I would lose the primaries, then the general election. FAKE NEWS!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2017Thr coverage about me in the @nytimes and the @washingtonpost gas been so false and angry that the times actually apologized to its ..  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2017So, in other words, Trump is proving the aides who are leaking the details of his alarming behavior to the press right. He is clueless, dangerously impulsive, petty, and acting like a child. In fact, they are likely leaking this information to the public in a desperate attempt to make Trump behave like a world leader rather than like the man baby that he is, since he gets all of his information from the cable news shows.Whatever the reason, keep the leaks coming, folks. The American public   and, indeed, the press   need to keep the pressure on Trump and let the nation and world know just what a dangerous fool is currently occupying the Oval Office.#RESIST.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",

        "text": "The entire nation is now waiting with bated breath for fired FBI Director James Comey to testify in open session Congress in what might be the biggest political event since election night. That will not take place until Thursday, and in the meantime, bombshells keep dropping from the White House   especially on the subject of just how troubled Comey was by Trump s behavior. In fact, it seems that Comey was so uneasy that he actually told Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to leave him alone with Trump.The New York Times is reporting that Trump s inappropriate requests for Comey and the FBI to drop certain elements of the Russian hacking investigations made him uncomfortable enough that he went to Sessions and told him that he and his agency needed him to be a firewall of protection from investigation meddling from the West Wing of the White House. Comey, however, never told Sessions specific details of just what had him so worried when it came to Trump; after all, Sessions and Trump are notoriously close, and it is not a certainty that Sessions is completely trustworthy in these matters, either.When asked about these conversations with the now-former FBI Director, the Department of Justice only said: The attorney general doesn t believe it s appropriate to respond to media inquiries on matters that may be related to ongoing investigations. So, in other words, there s no denial here that these conversations took place. This is quite a development, considering that the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was so deeply concerned about the behavior of the nation s chief executive that he simply could not bring himself to be alone in a room with him.Trump s problematic behavior causes Obama Justice Department Official Matthew S. Axelrod to weigh in. He said: You have the president of the United States talking to the director of the F.B.I., not just about any criminal investigation, but one involving his presidential campaign. That is such a sharp departure from all the past traditions and rules of the road. Indeed, if this behavior is not illegal, it is, at the very least, wildly inappropriate and unethical. Thursday should be a goldmine of new revelations from Comey. Hopefully, said revelations get us at least a step or two closer to being rid of this Trumpster fire of an  administration.

The FBI found evidence Clinton broke the law, that she placed highly classified national security information at risk and repeatedly lied to the American people about her reckless conduct. None of this changes the fact that the FBI continues to investigate the Clinton Foundation for corruption involving her tenure as secretary of state. Hillary Clinton should never be president. Last week, Fox News cited two sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI s investigations as saying the agency s probes into the Clinton Foundation continue to be a  very high priority  among local agents on the ground.Fox News further reported:Agents have interviewed and re-interviewed multiple people on the foundation case, which is looking into possible pay for play interaction between then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. The FBI s White Collar Crime Division is handling the investigation.There is a split, however, between local investigators and FBI headquarters, as well as with the Justice Department.Here is the full text of Comey s letter on Sunday informing lawmakers of the FBI s decision to not alter the agency s conclusion reached last July that it will not recommend charges against Clinton in the email case:I write to supplement my October 28, 2016 letter that notified you the FBI would be taking additional investigative steps with respect to former Secretary of State Clinton s use of a personal email server.Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation.During that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State.Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.

        "text": "Eight members of a family, seven adults and one teenager were shot and killed in rural Ohio in what authorities have described as an  execution style  homicide. Authorities say that all of the victims appear to have been shot in the back of the head. There were, however, three children who survived the shooting, all under the age of four. Ohio s attorney general Mike DeWine said: What makes this particularly grisly is the fact that you have these children involved who obviously were there when the executions took. The one mum was apparently killed in her bed with the four-day-old right there. It s just hard to believe. DeWine added that the killings may have taken place when the victims were in their beds adding,  You have one person who is armed and dangerous and there may be more than one, there may be two, there may be three. The victims were found Pike County, which is about 70 miles (112km) south of Ohio s capital, Columbus in separate homes. DeWine said: All of the victims are believed to possibly be members of the same family, and they were found in three Union Hill Road homes. The attorney general asked the public to contact authorities about any information that would lead to the capture of the suspect in the murders.Watch video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjlsh9oRxl4]Featured image via video screenshot.",

        "text": "How many more days remain in our Community Organizer In Chief s term in office? He can t make golfing his full time job fast enough This week, former CIA director Gen. David Petraeus testified on Capitol Hill, warning that inaction in Syria carries risks for the United States. Russia s recent military escalation in Syria is a further reminder that when the U.S. does not take the initiative, others will fill the vacuum   often in ways that are harmful to our interests,  Petraeus said.FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE   Russian, Syrian and Iranian military commanders have set up a coordination cell in Baghdad in recent days to try to begin working with Iranian-backed Shia militias fighting the Islamic State, Fox News has learned.Western intelligence sources say the coordination cell includes low-level Russian generals. U.S. officials say it is not clear whether the Iraqi government is involved at the moment.Describing the arrival of Russian military personnel in Baghdad, one senior U.S. official said,  They are popping up everywhere. CNN Report Sept. 8, 2015:The Russians already have been building up their military presence in Syria, a subject expected to factor prominently in a planned meeting between President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin in New York Monday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.While the U.S. also is fighting the Islamic State, the Obama administration has voiced concern that Russia s involvement, at least in Syria, could have a destabilizing effect.Moscow, though, has fostered ties with the governments in both Syria and Iraq. In May, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi flew to Moscow for an official visit to discuss potential Russian arms transfers and shared intelligence capability, as well as the enhancement of security and military capabilities, according to a statement by the Iraqi prime minister s office at the time.Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani also was spotted in Baghdad on Sept 22. He met with Shia militias backed by Iran; intelligence officials believe he met with Russians as well.Meanwhile, a U.S. official described to Fox News how, over the weekend, the Russians were able to move 24 attack jets into Syria undetected.The Russian military flew 12 Sukhoi Su-25  Frogfoot  and a dozen Sukhoi Su-24  Fencer  attack aircraft in  tight formations  under the  steady stream  of the large Russian An-124 cargo planes that have been ferrying supplies from bases in Russia through Iran before traveling on to Syria, the official said.The large cargo planes appeared as  a big blip  on radar, but flying beneath them were  tight formations  of the smaller Russian fighter jets that used jamming pods and switched off their IFF, which would identify the aircraft to radar.The large Russian cargo planes have the capability to fly directly from Russia to Syria, but the smaller attack aircraft do not. The Russian jets did not have the legs to make it directly from Russia to Syria, and needed a base to refuel,  said the official, who spoke to Fox News under the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to disclose sensitive information.According to the Aviationist, the Russian cargo planes and fighter jets landed at an airbase in Hamadan, Iran, roughly halfway between Baghdad and Tehran on Sept 18-19.Fox News also has learned from U.S. military sources that the Russians have begun flying some of the Sukhoi fighter and attack jets from Bassel al-Assad airport, in Latakia, now a Russian forward operating base along the Mediterranean.The planes are not dropping bombs or conducting attack missions, but just flying around near the base, according to one official. The official also confirmed that Russian destroyers are in position off the Mediterranean coast.On Thursday, State Department spokesman John Kirby denied a U.S. intelligence failure led to U.S. officials being caught unaware of the two dozen Russian warplanes arriving in Syria. I can tell you that we ve been watching this very, very closely   and we have not been ignorant of what the Russians have been doing,  said Kirby.Asked Thursday about Russia s military involvement in Syria, Defense Secretary Ash Carter cautioned that without Russian support for a  political transition  in Damascus, it could  pour gasoline on the ISIL phenomenon rather than to lead to the defeat of ISIL. But just two days ago, Secretary of State John Kerry said the Russian build-up was consistent with defensive measures. For the moment, it is the judgment of our military and most experts that the level and type represents basically force protection, a level of protection for their deployment to an airbase given the fact that it is in an area of conflict,  Kerry said at the State Department Tuesday.

        "text": "Does anyone believe for one second that Hillary or Bernie give a damn about the citizens of Flint, MI? This water issue is nothing more than a campaign tool for Hillary and Bernie, used to prove how much they care for the majority black community of Flint. It s also a great way to pin the blame on MI Republican Governor, Rick Snyder. For anyone who s keeping score, Allentown, PA has the highest recorded elevated lead level in the state, at 23.11% higher than the rest of the state, compared to Flint, Michigan s 3.21%. Allentown, PA has a Democrat mayor, Ed Pawlowski, who has something in common with Hillary, he s under investigation by the FBI. As a side note, a Republican has not held a seat on Allentown city council since 2006. Pennsylvania s govenror, Tom Wolf is also a Democrat.The lead poisoning crisis in Flint, Michigan, was a surprise, an emergency that occurred after the city switched to a new, cheaper water source.But there are at least six cities in the United States where we should, in theory, have really good data on lead exposure. In fiscal year 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spent almost $2 million as part of a three-year funding commitment to help some of the biggest cities in the country monitor lead exposure.I spent the past week looking at these cities, and came away with three main findings. The first is that the rate of lead exposure in Pennsylvania is incredibly alarming. Nearly 10 percent of the more than 140,000 kids tested had levels of 5 or more micrograms per deciliter of lead in the blood (5  g/dL)   this is the threshold the government uses to identify children with dangerously elevated blood lead levels. One percent tested positive for blood lead levels greater than 10  g/dL.Compare that to Flint, where state data shows the rate of lead exposure for 5  g/dL from 2014 to 2015 as 3.21 percent. Other researchers have found that specific areas of the city have exposure rates as high as 6.3 percent. That s alarming, but still a lower rate than 18 of the 20 cities in Pennsylvania.While there is strong reason to believe that the increased lead exposure rates in Flint are related to the change in Flint s water source to the Flint River in April 2014, it is important to note that the lead exposure rates in Pennsylvania are largely linked to aging, deteriorating lead-based paint (chips and dust).Second, there are cities that have made really good strides in reducing lead exposure; both Chicago and New York are prime examples.Third, even some of these cities that get money for the express purpose of monitoring lead exposure do not make finding the data easy.Vox reached out to the six cities currently receiving funding from the CDC   Houston, Texas, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago, and New York City. Of the six cities, only two were able to provide lead exposure data at the neighborhood level. The other four are getting money to monitor lead exposure   but aren t making the results easily accessible to the public.Philadelphia was not able to share community-area lead level exposure rates, but a 2014 Pennsylvania Department of Health annual report that included detailed information on 20 cities showed that 17 of those had a higher percentage of children with blood lead levels (BLLs)   5  g/dL than the rest of the state.Cities like Allentown and Altoona had more than double the state exposure rate of 9.37 percent, and the group of 20 cities had a collective rate of 11.49 percent, also higher than the state rate. The geometric mean of blood lead level tests performed in Pennsylvania was 2.3  g/dL, which is substantially lower than the state s rate, indicating some cities in Pennsylvania are disproportionately impacted by lead exposure.

Here s what she said on her Facebook page:  At this racist-ass Highland Creek Heritage Festival where a car featuring two Confederate flags is being celebrated. This wannabe hillbilly is trying to  educate  me on the Civil War!!! Guess he doesn t realize his side lost!!!  The video is sideways but you ll get the point: Anderson shrieked:  This racist car has not one, but two Confederate flags on it.  The astonished owner of the car attempted to explain but Anderson was just interested in getting the car removed ASAP:  People who look exactly like me and my sons died, were murdered, because of that flag. It has no place here and it is the very first car people see when they walk in.  THE KICKER IN ALL THIS IS THAT IF YOU GO TO MS.

If there were a swastika here I would have known right away, that can t be here. Now I know the Confederate flag has the same status.

        "text": "Obama aims to make illegals eligible for federal benefits This is unreal but what s more unreal is that Obama gets the vote if the Supreme Court has a tie vote. Oh, so we really just have one branch of government and that s the Executive Branch   Lawful presence  is an immigration classification established by Congress that is necessary for valuable benefits, such as Medicare and Social Security. Does the president of the United States have the power to unilaterally tell millions of individuals who are violating federal law that he will not enforce that law against them now, that they may continue to violate that law in the future and that he will take action that makes them eligible for federal benefit programs for which they are not currently eligible due to their unlawful status?Through Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, President Barack Obama is telling the Supreme Court exactly this right now.The solicitor general calls what Obama is doing  prosecutorial discretion. He argues that under this particular type of  prosecutorial discretion,  the executive can make millions of people in this country illegally eligible for Social Security, disability and Medicare.On April 18, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case. Entitled United States v. Texas, it pits President Obama against not only the Lone Star State, but also a majority of the states, which have joined in the litigation against the administration.At issue is the policy the administration calls Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, which would allow aliens in this country illegally who are parents of citizens or lawful permanent residents to stay in the United States. The Executive Branch unilaterally created a program   known as DAPA   that contravenes Congress s complex statutory framework for determining when an alien may lawfully enter, remain in, and work in the country,  the attorney general and solicitor general of Texas explained in a brief submitted to the Supreme Court on behalf of the states seeking to block the policy. DAPA would deem over four million unlawfully present aliens as  lawfully present  and eligible for work authorization,  says the Texas brief.  And  lawful presence  is an immigration classification established by Congress that is necessary for valuable benefits, such as Medicare and Social Security. Read more: cns",

        "text": "In another show of just how disturbing the Republican Party s base has become, an astonishing number of primary voters marching out of the polls in South Carolina proudly said they supported Trump s idea to ban Muslims from entering the United States.According to a CBS News exit poll conducted during the South Carolina primary, a staggering 75 percent of voters said they supported Trump s proposal to ban Muslims. This is in line, but actually slightly up, from an earlier South Carolina poll that found Trump supporters overwhelming favored legalizing discrimination against Muslims.There s also 62/23 support among Trump voters for creating a national database of Muslims and 40/36 support for shutting down all the mosques in the United States, something no one else s voters back. Only 44% of Trump voters think the practice of Islam should even be legal at all in the United States, to 33% who think it should be illegal. To put all the views toward Muslims in context though, 32% of Trump voters continue to believe the policy of Japanese internment during World War II was a good one In the days after the San Bernardino terror attack, Trump demanded that America ban Muslims   even American citizens currently abroad   from entering the country. He ordered a  total and complete  shutdown on Muslims   indefinitely. Or as he put it: Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. Certain political observers believed that Trump s proposal to ban Muslims   even American citizens abroad   from entering or re-entering the United States was so far beyond the pale that he would suffer in the polls because of it. Jeb Bush even risked his own campaign to call Trump out on it.Donald Trump is unhinged. His \"policy\" proposals are not serious.  Jeb Bush (@JebBush) December 7, 2015Unfortunately for common decency (and Jeb Bush), Trump s supporters loved the idea. His polls actually went up. Republicans have since only embraced Trump s bigoted ideas at ever scarier levels of enthusiasm.Given the hatred coming out of the election booths, it s no surprise to learn that Donald Trump is projected to win South Carolina by a massive margin. If moderate Republicans are wondering how the GOP went so wrong, they might want to look at what the voters are actually saying: Trump represents discrimination, bigotry, and hatred. And they absolutely adore him.Featured image via Darron Birgenheier/Flickr",

        "text": " The Times asserts that such censorship would be good for democracy   and it surely is true that hoaxes and baseless conspiracy theories are no help to democracy   but regulation of information in the manner that the Times suggests has more than a whiff of Orwellian totalitarianism to it.  Robert Parry  Consortium NewsIn its lead editorial on Sunday, The New York Times decried what it deemed  The Digital Virus Called Fake News  and called for Internet censorship to counter this alleged problem, taking particular aim at Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for letting  liars and con artists hijack his platform. As this mainstream campaign against  fake news  quickly has gained momentum in the past week, two false items get cited repeatedly, a claim that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump and an assertion that Trump was prevailing in the popular vote over Hillary Clinton. I could add another election-related falsehood, a hoax spread by Trump supporters that liberal documentarian Michael Moore was endorsing Trump when he actually was backing Clinton.But I also know that Clinton supporters were privately pushing some salacious and unsubstantiated charges about Trump s sex life, and Clinton personally charged that Trump was under the control of Russian President Vladimir Putin although there was no evidence presented to support that McCarthyistic accusation.The simple reality is that lots of dubious accusations get flung around during the heat of a campaign   nothing new there   and it is always a challenge for professional journalists to swat them down the best we can. What s different now is that the Times envisions some structure (or algorithm) for eliminating what it calls  fake news. Photograph published by the New York Times purportedly taken in Russia of Russian soldiers who later appeared in eastern Ukraine. However, the photographer has since stated that the photo was actually taken in Ukraine, and the U.S. State Department has acknowledged the error.But, with a stunning lack of self-awareness, the Times fails to acknowledge the many times that it has published  fake news,  such as reporting in 2002 that Iraq s purchase of aluminum tubes meant that it was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program; its bogus analysis tracing the firing location of a Syrian sarin-laden rocket in 2013 back to a Syrian military base that turned out to be four times outside the rocket s range; or its publication of photos supposedly showing Russian soldiers inside Russia and then inside Ukraine in 2014 when it turned out that the  inside-Russia  photo was also taken inside Ukraine, destroying the premise of the story.These are just three examples among many of the Times publishing  fake news    and all three appeared on Page One before being grudgingly or partially retracted, usually far inside the newspaper under opaque headlines so most readers wouldn t notice. Much of the Times   fake news  continued to reverberate in support of U.S. government propaganda even after the partial retractions.Who Is the Judge?So, should Zuckerberg prevent Facebook users from circulating New York Times stories? Obviously, the Times would not favor that solution to the problem of  fake news.  Instead, the Times expects to be one of the arbiters deciding which Internet outlets get banned and which ones get gold seals of approval.The Times lead editorial, following a front-page article on the same topic on Friday, leaves little doubt what the newspaper would like to see. It wants major Internet platforms and search engines, such as Facebook and Google, to close off access to sites accused of disseminating  fake news. The editorial said,  a big part of the responsibility for this scourge rests with internet companies like Facebook and Google, which have made it possible for fake news to be shared nearly instantly with millions of users and have been slow to block it from their sites.  Facebook says it is working on weeding out such fabrications. It said last Monday that it would no longer place Facebook-powered ads on fake news websites, a move that could cost Facebook and those fake news sites a lucrative source of revenue. Earlier on the same day, Google said it would stop letting those sites use its ad placement network. These steps would help, but Facebook, in particular, owes its users, and democracy itself, far more. Facebook has demonstrated that it can effectively block content like click-bait articles and spam from its platform by tweaking its algorithms, which determine what links, photos and ads users see in their news feeds.   Facebook managers are constantly changing and refining the algorithms, which means the system is malleable and subject to human judgment. The Times editorial continued:  This summer, Facebook decided to show more posts from friends and family members in users  news feeds and reduce stories from news organizations, because that s what it said users wanted.

Mr. Zuckerberg himself has spoken at length about how social media can help improve society.   None of that will happen if he continues to let liars and con artists hijack his platform. Gray AreasBut the problem is that while some falsehoods may be obvious and clear-cut, much information exists in a gray area in which two or more sides may disagree on what the facts are. And the U.S. government doesn t always tell the truth although you would be hard-pressed to find recent examples of the Times recognizing that reality. Especially over the past several decades, the Times has usually embraced the Official Version of a disputed event and has deemed serious skepticism out of bounds.Former New York Times reporter Judith Miller, co-author of the Iraq  aluminum tube  story.That was the way the Times treated denials from the Iraqi government and some outside experts who disputed the  aluminum tube  story in 2002   and how the Times has brushed off disagreements regarding the U.S. government s portrayal of events in Syria, Ukraine and Russia. Increasingly, the Times has come across as a propaganda conduit for Official Washington rather than a professional journalistic entity.But the Times and other mainstream news outlets   along with some favored Internet sites   now sit on a Google-financed entity called the First Draft Coalition, which presents itself as a kind of Ministry of Truth that will decide which stories are true and which are  fake. If the Times  editorial recommendations are followed, the disfavored stories and the sites publishing them would no longer be accessible through popular search engines and platforms, essentially blocking the public s access to them. [See Consortiumnews.com s  What to Do About  Fake News. ]The Times asserts that such censorship would be good for democracy   and it surely is true that hoaxes and baseless conspiracy theories are no help to democracy   but regulation of information in the manner that the Times suggests has more than a whiff of Orwellian totalitarianism to it.And the proposal is especially troubling coming from the Times, with its checkered recent record of disseminating dangerous disinformation.*** Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

        "text": "Until November 8, Democrats desperately tried to dismiss the prediction of presidential historian Allan Lichtman, who has accurately predicted every presidential election for the last 30 years. Unfortunately, it turned out polls were wrong and he was completely right.Lichtman has a second part to his prediction, though. While he accurately called the fact that Trump would win the White House, he s now predicting that he will just as quickly lose it through impeachment.While his electoral prediction was based on a scientific system, his latest prediction is not. It s a gut call, but let s call his an educated gut. His main argument is the baggage that Trump is carrying with him to the Oval Office. But it has a few reasons behind it. What you see [with Trump] is what you get: candidates don t fundamentally change. Donald Trump throughout his life has played fast and loose with the law. He was found by the justice department in the seventies to have discriminated against African Americans with his real estate business. This video is a couple of days old, so Lichtman didn t know that Trump would be settling the Trump University fraud case that s been hanging over his head, but that s far from the only scandal. While that alleged victim in the child rape case dropped the charges, Gloria Allred, the alleged victim s attorney, said the story isn t over yet.All of this, though, might just be an excuse to get rid of Trump. Trump is a wildcard and if there s anything Republicans can t stand, it s unpredictable behavior. Republicans love control and they would love to see Mike Pence, the vice president, as president because he is predictable and controllable. Pence is anti-choice and anti-gay. Trump keeps changing his opinions on those issues. That type of moral uncertainty doesn t sit well with the  ber religious Republican Party.Here s the video:Of course, if Trump is impeached, that would leave us with a President Pence. Trust me when I say that s no better.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",

        "text": "21st Century Wire says For years, the United Nations seems to have been embroiled in an endless string of scandals and cover-ups, and yet rarely, if ever, has anyone ever actually been held to account. This has led a number of pundits to accuse the institution of being  above the law  and riddled with institutional corruption.This latest story only reaffirms these accusations Independent journalist Matthew Russell Lee (photo, left) founded Bronx-based Inner City Press in 2005 and received official press accreditation to cover the United Nations in New York City. He was the first-ever independent, non-affiliated blogger to be given access to the UN s inner sanctum. Since then Inner City Press has broken stories on a number of controversial stories: peacekeeper rapes in Africa, UN cholera in Haiti, war crimes in Sri Lanka and Burundi, the Sudans, SEMG and Yemen (see a leaked letter here), as well as corruption within UN Headquarters (cocaine shipments through its mail room and the current bribery scandals).Apparently, it was all too much for diplomatic luminaries at the UN. Last month, Lee was forcibly ejected from the UN headquarters.The DC-based Government Accountability Project, which defends UN and other whistleblowers, believes that the ouster of Inner City Press from the UN s press office is  retaliatory in response to independent, critical journalism. UN Restricts of Free PressOn the afternoon of February 19th, Inner City Press questioned UN inaction in South Sudan and Burundi and financial irregularities, and was handed a letter from Ban Ki-moon s Under Secretary General for Public Information Cristina Gallach ordering Inner City Press to surrender its Resident Correspondent accreditation of eight years and be removed from the UN by 5 pm. In a letter that gave Inner City Press only two hours notice, Gallach told Inner City Press to surrender the key to its long-time shared office. Read the UN letter here. Later, while Inner City Press was writing up a UN Security Council meeting on Syria that went into the evening, a total of eight UN Security guards under Deputy Chief Michael McNulty tore off Inner City Press  UN ID badge and grabbed Inner City Press  laptop and camera, before throwing them on the sidewalk on First Avenue as well as physically throwing journalist Matthew Lee on the street in freezing weather, without a coat.

The New York Times ran with the story that Trump was pushing Comey to drop the Flynn investigation.GP: Comey also told the Senate Intelligence Committee he knew The New York Times was publishing leaked reports that were not accurate.

Comey:   In the main it was not true.  And, again, all of you know this, maybe the American people do not, the challenge, and I m not picking on reporters, about writing stories about classified information is, the people talking about it often don t really know what s going on and those of us who actually know what s going on are not talking about it.And we don t call the press to say  hey, you got that thing wrong about his sensitive topic.'

        "title": " The Army Field Manual Proves That Trump Is Too Mentally Unstable To Be President (DETAILS)",
        "text": "As commander-in-chief, shouldn t the Army field manual apply to the president as well as the men and women he commands?Because one psychiatrist brilliantly used the Army field manual to demonstrate that Donald Trump is mentally unfit to be president.Dr. Prudence L. Gourguechon wrote an editorial for the Los Angeles Times detailing how Trump s behavior makes him an unfit leader and she proved it by consulting the field manual used by the United States Army.After pointing out that the 25th Amendment of the Constitution has been getting a lot of attention recently because of Trump s behavior, Dr. Gourguechon said that after searching through  thousands of articles and books written on leadership, primarily in the business arena, I have found only one source where the capacities necessary for strategic leadership are clearly and comprehensively laid out: the U.S. Army s  Field Manual 6-22 Leader Development. That is particularly interesting since Trump is the commander of America s armed forces.Specifically, the manual discusses the areas of trust, discipline and self-control, judgement and critical thinking, self-awareness, and empathy. And as Dr. Gourguechon notes, Trump fails in every category.On trust, the manual states that  Leaders shape the ethical climate of their organization while developing the trust and relationships that enable proper leadership. Gouguechon elaborated.A leader who is deficient in the capacity for trust makes little effort to support others, may be isolated and aloof, may be apathetic about discrimination, allows distrustful behaviors to persist among team members, makes unrealistic promises and focuses on self-promotion.As we know, Trump doesn t trust people and he sows an environment of distrust. And let s not pretend that Trump hasn t made unrealistic promises or promoted himself.On discipline and self-control, the manual mentions traits such as selflessness, respect, integrity, and courage. If you are laughing, it s because you know that Trump has none of these traits. In fact, he is the most undisciplined and selfish person on the planet. Or at the very least the most undisciplined and selfish person who has ever lived in the White House. Without discipline and self-control, a leader may not be able to resist temptation, to stay focused despite distractions, to avoid impulsive action or to think before jumping to a conclusion,  Dr. Gourguechon wrote.  The leader who fails to demonstrate discipline reacts  viscerally or angrily when receiving bad news or conflicting information,  and he  allows personal emotions to drive decisions or guide responses to emotionally charged situations. On judgement and critical thinking, the manual makes it clear that Trump has no business being the commander-in-chief.A leader with the capacity for critical thinking  seeks to obtain the most thorough and accurate understanding possible,  the manual says, and he anticipates  first, second and third consequences of multiple courses of action.  A leader deficient in judgment and strategic thinking demonstrates rigid and inflexible thinking.The manual also makes it clear that Trump lacks self-awareness. It describes him perfectly. Self-aware leaders know themselves, including their traits, feelings, and behaviors,  the manual says.  They employ self-understanding and recognize their effect on others.  When a leader lacks self-awareness, the manual notes, he  unfairly blames subordinates when failures are experienced  and  rejects or lacks interest in feedback. The same goes for empathy.A good leader  demonstrates an understanding of another person s point of view  and  identifies with others  feelings and emotions.  The manual s description of inadequacy in this area:  Shows a lack of concern for others  emotional distress  and  displays an inability to take another s perspective. So if we go by the military leadership standards outlined in the Army field manual, Trump should be removed from office as soon as possible. He definitely should not have been allowed to take office in the first place. Americans need to take Trump s behavior seriously. He literally controls the most powerful military in the world, and the military would never voluntarily make him their leader if they follow this manual. That speaks volumes.Featured Image: Ralph Freso/Getty Images",

What these poor misguided parents have clearly missed is how many Latino s don t support amnesty for people who ve illegally crossed our borders It seems like plenty of people have wanted to take a bat to Donald Trump s head this year, and last night in Oregon, some kids finally had the chance with a pi ata shaped like the Republican presidential candidate.At the grand opening for El Diablito, a food cart in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday, a group of predominately of children and Latinos took turns hitting a candy-filled Trump pi ata with a baseball bat.The group had some choice words as they took swings at the life-size presidential candidate figure, which had Trump posing with his mouth open and his middle fingers raised. I want to kill him,  one child said as he watched someone hit the pi ata.One woman eagerly smashed the pi ata as she hit it several times. Because f*** Trump,  she said when asked why she wanted a turn.  I m sorry I know there are kids here, but he really sucks that hard. Another man took several swings at the pi ata as he spoke about why he didn t believe that Trump should be elected. You re bringing hate and we don t want you as a president,  the man said as he hit the figure.The owner of El Diablito said, however, that the Donald Trump pi ata had nothing to do with politics, and was instead a way of bringing people to his food truck s grad opening. It has nothing to do about politics, actually,  he said.  It s about having a good time. I figured that would be the best character for everybody to be excited to take a hit at,  he added.  It s all about popularity and he s at the top of it right now A video of the event concludes with a little girl smashing the body off of the pi ata and a man holding the Trump figure s head by the hair as its body likes broken on the ground.Via: UK Daily Mail ",

        "text": "Presidents are supposed to serve the American people, but Trump has made it clear that everyone works for him and he is not to be questioned or investigated or placed under scrutiny. Ever. Even when it comes to Russia, even when it comes to his severe lack of ethics and his Constitutional violations. We know about many of his conflicts of interest, which very well may break the law, and one would expect them to improve as time goes by. However, they re getting worse, not better.Historically, presidents do not go into office with the number of business interests Trump has. Previous presidents have placed what interests they do have into blind trusts, which means the president separates himself from them entirely. He has no influence, he gets no information. Trump? Not so much. Sure, his businesses are in a trust, but his sons manage it and they give him updates regularly.Even if they didn t, they re helping their father corrupt the Office of the President with his business. Trump s sons have pitched an idea for budget hotels called  American Idea,  and have gone so far as to sign letters of intent to build said hotels in economically depressed areas in red states.That isn t an  America first,  initiative so much as it s a way for Trump to expand his brand and boost his popularity among the plebes he otherwise ignores.(We all have a million dollars that says those hotels will hire foreign workers for cheap, as Mar a Lago in Florida just did.)Trump s presence at his golf clubs serves as promotion, and some of them (like Mar a Lago) are raking in the dough from increased membership fees and people willing to pay them in order to say they ve rubbed shoulders with him and other world leaders. His decision to roll back an environmental policy ensuring clean drinking water directly benefits his golf courses, which means he brings in even more money.The Trump International Hotel in D.C., situated in the historic Old Post Office building, isn t supposed to belong to any government officials. The reason Trump can have such an interest in it is supposedly because his business is in a trust, so he technically doesn t have an interest. Or something. Regardless, the hotel is supposed to be donating profits from foreign officials who stay there to the U.S. Treasury, but Trump said that asking foreign officials to identify themselves as such would  diminish the guest experience. So he s directly profiting from foreign officials who stay there, either to curry favor with him or because they think it d be rude to stay with a competitor. It s probably both.Trump was obviously corrupt before before he was even elected   he s known this whole time how to milk campaigns and how to milk his office for all its worth, so that when he leaves he s richer than ever. During his campaign, he made heavy use of his own properties. That might make sense, but the law reveals just how he lined his pockets with campaign donations.Federal election law requires a campaign to pay fair market value for goods and services bought from a candidate s own businesses. Most candidates with their own business interests wind up spending one to three percent of their total spending on their businesses. Trump s spending was above 10 percent. There s no way that was an accident.Trump is corrupt. He knows it. We all know it. That s why he says that the president isn t subject to ethics laws   he s trying to build the case that he can do what he wants because he s the president and we re not.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",

While Trump continues to smash Clinton in attendance at events, Hillary appears to have decided to take weekends off.Clinton took the weekend of August 6th and 7th off and she decided to take three days off this past weekend August 12th through 14th. She also has no events scheduled to participate in this coming Thursday through Saturday August 18th through 20th. This in essence would mean another three days off after three days of events scheduled starting today. In total Clinton has taken 7 days off in August out of the first 14 days and is scheduled to continue with this approach through at least this coming Saturday.Donald Trump on the other hand has taken only two days off in August, Sunday August 7th and Sunday the 14th. Trump has 7 days where he has participated in more than one campaign event.As previously noted, Trump has more than ten times the number of people at his campaign events than Hillary has at hers since August 1st. More than 100,000 people have shown up for Trump events since the beginning of August (with many more turned away due to the events reaching capacity). Hillary on the other hand hasn t even had one tenth of that or not even 10,000 show up at her events since August 1st.Also, it is clear by just looking at the crowds at Trump and Clinton events that Trump has a movement and Hillary has barely a heartbeat.Here s Trump questioning Hillary s low energy campaign:Trump s largest event was in Ft Lauderdale, Florida, where it was estimated that the massive crowd there to see him was near 20,000. The largest crowd Clinton spoke at was in Washington, DC but this was a NABJ/NAHJ Event which had an estimated 4,000 in attendance. Hillary s largest event held by her campaign in August was back on August 1st in Omaha, NE when businessman Warren Buffett joined her and an estimated 3,000 locals. In total when looking at just the Clinton campaign events, barely 8,000 people showed up to the seven campaign events since August 1st. It is unknown why Clinton is taking so much time off. Questions arise whether it is related to her terrible campaign event turnout or her poor health or some combination of both.  Gateway Pundit ",

        "text": "Consortium News Exclusive: The U.S. mainstream media finally has its  smoking gun  on Russia-gate   incriminating information from a junior Trump campaign adviser   but a closer look reveals serious problems with the  evidence,  writes Robert Parry.By Robert ParryRussia-gate special prosecutor Robert Mueller has turned up the heat on President Trump with the indictment of Trump s former campaign manager for unrelated financial crimes and the disclosure of a guilty plea from a low-level foreign policy adviser for lying to the FBI.While longtime Republican fixer Paul Manafort, who helped guide Trump s campaign to the GOP nomination in summer 2016, was the big name in the news on Monday, the mainstream media focused more on court documents related to George Papadopoulos, a 30-year-old campaign aide who claims to have heard about Russia possessing Hillary Clinton s emails before they became public on the Internet, mostly via WikiLeaks.While that would seem to bolster the Russia-gate narrative   that Russian intelligence  hacked  Democratic emails and President Vladimir Putin ordered the emails be made public to undermine Clinton s campaign   the evidentiary thread that runs through Papadopoulos s account remains tenuous.That s in part because his credibility has already been undermined by his guilty plea for lying to the FBI and by the fact that he now has a motive to provide something the prosecutors might want in exchange for leniency. Plus, there is the hearsay and contested quality of Papadopoulos s supposed information, some of which already has turned out to be false.According to the court documents, Papadopoulos got to know a professor of international relations who claimed to have  substantial connections with Russian government officials,  with the professor identified in press reports as Joseph Mifsud, a little-known academic associated with the University of Stirling in Scotland.The first contact supposedly occurred in mid-March 2016 in Italy, with a second meeting in London on March 24 when the professor purportedly introduced Papadopoulos to a Russian woman whom the young campaign aide believed to be Putin s niece, an assertion that Mueller s investigators determined wasn t true.Trump, who then was under pressure for not having a foreign policy team, included Papadopoulos as part of a list drawn up to fill that gap, and Papadopoulos participated in a campaign meeting on March 31 in Washington at which he suggested a meeting between Trump and Putin, a prospect that other senior aides reportedly slapped down.The  Email  BreakfastBut Papadopoulos continued his outreach to Russia, according to the court documents, which depict the most explosive meeting as an April 26 breakfast in London with the professor (Mifsud) supposedly saying he had been in Moscow and  learned that the Russians had obtained  dirt  on then-candidate Clinton  and possessed  thousands of emails.  Mainstream press accounts concluded that Mifsud must have been referring to the later-released emails.However, Mifsud told The Washington Post in an email last August that he had  absolutely no contact with the Russian government  and described his ties to Russia as strictly in academic fields.In an interview with the U.K. Daily Telegraph after Monday s disclosures, Mifsud acknowledged meeting with Papadopoulos but disputed the contents of the conversations as cited in the court papers. Specifically, he denied knowing anything about emails containing  dirt  on Clinton and called the claim that he introduced Papadopoulos to a  female Russian national  as a  laughingstock. According to the Telegraph interview, Mifsud said he tried to put Papadopoulos in touch with experts on the European Union and introduced him to the director of a Russian think tank, the Russian International Affairs Council.It was the latter contact that the court papers presumably referred to in saying that on May 4, the Russian contact with ties to the foreign ministry wrote to Papadopoulos and Mifsud, reporting that ministry officials were  open for cooperation,  a message that Papadopoulos forwarded to a senior campaign official, asking whether the contacts were  something we want to move forward with. However, even an article in The New York Times, which has aggressively pushed the Russia-gate  scandal  from the beginning, noted the evidentiary holes that followed from that point.The Times  Scott Shane wrote:  A crucial detail is still missing: Whether and when Mr. Papadopoulos told senior Trump campaign officials about Russia s possession of hacked emails. And it appears that the young aide s quest for a deeper connection with Russian officials, while he aggressively pursued it, led nowhere. Shane added,  the court documents describe in detail how Mr. Papadopoulos continued to report to senior campaign officials on his efforts to arrange meetings with Russian officials,   the documents do not say explicitly whether, and to whom, he passed on his most explosive discovery   that the Russians had what they considered compromising emails on Mr. Trump s opponent. J.D. Gordon, a former Pentagon official who worked for the Trump campaign as a national security adviser and helped arrange the March 31 foreign policy meeting, said he had known nothing about Mr. Papadopoulos  discovery that Russia had obtained Democratic emails or of his prolonged pursuit of meetings with Russians. Reasons to DoubtIf prosecutor Mueller had direct evidence that Papadopoulos had informed the Trump campaign about the Clinton emails, you would assume that the proof would have been included in Monday s disclosures. Further, since Papadopoulos was flooding the campaign with news about his Russian outreach, you might have expected that he would say something about how helpful the Russians had been in publicizing the Democratic emails.The absence of supporting evidence that Papadopoulos conveyed his hot news on the emails to campaign officials and Mifsud s insistence that he knew nothing about the emails would normally raise serious questions about Papadopoulos s credibility on this most crucial point.At least for now, those gaps represent major holes in the storyline. But Official Washington has been so desperate for  proof  about the alleged Russian  election meddling  for so long, that professional skepticism has been unwelcome in most media outlets.There is also another side of the story that rarely gets mentioned in the U.S. mainstream media: that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has repeatedly denied that he received the two batches of purloined Democratic emails   one about the Democratic National Committee and one about Clinton s campaign chairman John Podesta   from the Russians. While it is surely possible that the Russians might have used cutouts to pass on the emails, Assange and associates have suggested that at least the DNC emails came from a disgruntled insider.Also, former U.S. intelligence experts have questioned whether at least one batch of disclosed emails could have come from an overseas  hack  because the rapid download speed is more typical of copying files locally onto a memory stick or thumb drive.What I was told by an intelligence source several months ago was that Russian intelligence did engage in hacking efforts to uncover sensitive information, much as U.S. and other nations  intelligence services do, and that Democratic targets were included in the Russian effort.But the source said the more perplexing question was whether the Kremlin then ordered release of the data, something that Russian intelligence is usually loath to do and something that in this case would have risked retaliation from the expected winner of the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton.But such questions and doubts are clearly not welcome in the U.S. mainstream media, most of which has embraced Mueller s acceptance of Papadopoulos s story as the long-awaited  smoking gun  of Russia-gate.Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

For Clinton it was that her political group, Onward Together, supported a number of new progressive grass roots groups that did a lot of work on the ground.  Last night was a great reminder of what s possible when we come together and fight for what we believe in,  Clinton tweeted Wednesday morning.  So I wanted to take a few minutes to celebrate the extraordinary successes of a few groups I   and Onward Together   proudly fight alongside. For Biden, who is keeping the door open to a 2020 presidential bid, it was his candidate picks.In a note, to supporters, Biden said Americans voted for a  different kind of leadership.   And last night, nearly every single candidate that I endorsed at your recommendation was elected,  he wrote.  Daily MailWhy were Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden both taking credit for wins in VA, a blue state that went for Hillary in 2016 and, in spite of constantly being referred to in the media as a  swing state , hasn t been a  red state  since 2004 (see chart below):New Jersey is and has been a blue state for decades, so all of the self-congratulations and patting themselves on their own backs seems rather odd unless of course, Hillary and Joe are setting themselves up for what would be the most entertaining ever Democrat presidential primary in 2020. Anyone who believes that Hillary isn t up for another fight doesn t know Hillary. Fingers crossed Hillary s great at taking credit for a win, but prefers to blame everyone but herself when she loses bigly : Hillary Clinton has blamed Russian hackers for her loss   along with many others.

        "text": "By now, you ve probably heard that at a recent Ted Cruz rally, Carly Fiorina fell off the stage right after announcing the candidate and his family. She s fine, don t worry.Yet, leave it to Donald Trump to use this moment to his advantage in front of his band of merry morons.Trump told his crowd in Carmel, Indiana: Carly s perfectly nice. By the way, she fell off the stage the other day. Did anybody see that? And Cruz didn t do anything. Even I would have helped her, OK? Basically saying,  even I, the biggest jerk on earth, would have given her a hand. Then he just kept going with it, because you know, Trump: They just showed it to me coming in. I said,  No, I didn t see it.  They just showed it to me and I said,  wow, that s really cruel.  She fell off   she just went down. She went a long way down, right? She went down right in front of him and he was talking. He kept talking. He didn t even look like that was a weird deal. Man. And then they were both talking. She was talking from the back and he was talking from there. They re both talking. No, it was weird. Writing out a Trump transcript is very unique, because he will literally repeat himself over and over and over as though you didn t get it the first time.Of course, Trump is making a mountain out of a molehill. Cruz likely didn t even see her fall, and she was back to the stage within seconds.

According to White House officials, Trump is coming apart at the seams over this, as Robert Costa reported: Person close to Kelly framed it to me this way: POTUS fuming at press, coverage of C ville handling. In no mood for talk about moderation. Seriously, what did Trump expect to happen after he ignored America s pleas to denounce the violence for two whole days, before issuing a scripted, half-ass statement on Monday? Not even the white supremacists Trump targeted in his response believed that he was actually denouncing racism.If Trump wanted positive press coverage, he should have actually done his job and condemned the white supremacist values and bigotry from the start. Speaking up against racism and the violence that broke out of that white nationalist rally was possibly the easiest task a President could ask for, and Trump failed miserably at executing that. Instead, Trump protected and defended the racist attackers, making his approval rating only plummet further and giving the media even more things to criticize.Trump can blame the media all he wants, but it is his own lack of competency that is responsible for his failure as president. He never does the right thing, even when it is blatantly obvious what actions he should be taking. What happened in Charlottesville was an opportunity for Trump to emerge as a different president than most Americans expect him to be, and he completely blew it. There is something very wrong when a leader cares more about his press coverage than the lives of his constituents.Featured image via Branden Camp  / Getty Images",

        "title": "OBAMA\u2019S DOJ SUED Michigan City To Allow MEGA-MOSQUE In Majority Christian Residential Neighborhood\u2026Call Jeff Sessions NOW To Stop This Insanity",
        "text": "There is only ONE WAY to STOP this mosque from being built against the wishes of citizens in this RESIDENTIAL area, whose citizens are comprised of mostly Christian refugees that fled from Iraq to escape persecution at the hands of Muslims in their homeland: Call the US DOJ and ask our new Attorney General Jeff Sessions to review this case TODAY and ask the DOJ to STOP the mega-mosque from being built: 202-514-2000 A city of 130,000 people in southeastern Michigan is under the gun of Islamic pressure following its denial of a mega-mosque in a residential neighborhood populated largely by Christian refugees who fled Islamic persecution in Iraq.Sterling Heights already has two mosques, but a third, the American Islamic Community Center, applied for a permit and was rejected after it was determined its proposed use was incompatible with the residential area. Too much traffic, too little parking, the city planning commission decided by a 9-0 vote against the mosque in September 2015.But in December, the mosque sued the city and the Obama Justice Department joined in, claiming the real reason the mosque was denied was because the city was caving to anti-Muslim bigotry in the community. Now, a settlement deal is headed to the Sterling Heights City Council on Tuesday evening. If the council votes to sign the deal, it could be very costly for the city.Watch the attorney for the mosque developers call the reasons these mostly Christian refugees from Iraq are in opposition to a mosque being built its their residential neighborhood  fake :Local residents fear it s a bad deal, something similar to the Obama DOJ-orchestrated deal forced upon nearby Pittsfield Township, Michigan, last year. That town had to pay out $1.7 million to local Muslims to whom it had denied a permit for an Islamic school, and township employees were ordered to undergo sensitivity training to assure they never again discriminate against Muslims.Attorney General Jeff Sessions could cancel any similar deal from taking effect in Sterling Heights, but only if he is aware of it and acts quickly. If the city council is found to be cooperating with the Obama DOJ staff who are expediting this consent order to stick it to the Sessions/Trump team, then this city will go nuts,  said Dick Manaserri, spokesman for Secure Michigan, a group formed to educate the public on Shariah law and how it differs from American law.In last November s presidential election, Donald Trump carried Sterling Heights, normally a Democratic Party stronghold, by 56 to 44 percent over Hillary Clinton. He also carried Macomb County, home to Sterling Heights and also a Democratic-oriented county.But Trump s new AG, Sessions, is apparently not yet fully in control of the Justice Department, which includes many holdovers from the Obama administration. Why else would Jeff Sessions not dismiss the Obama DOJ lawsuit against Sterling Heights?  Manaserri asks.  We have been told by legal experts that he has the power to simply dismiss the lawsuit. A consent order typically implies wrongdoing with the application of penalties. When the planning commission denied the mosque permit in September 2015, hundreds of Sterling Heights residents gathered outside City Hall to celebrate. That celebration was caught on video, and critics cited it as evidence the city was somehow biased against Muslims. Tom Mitchell is a resident of Sterling Heights whose family has been there since 1965. He s seen the city s transformation over the past couple of decades under the control of what he calls  progressives.  He avoids the world  Democrat  because the city s elections are technically nonpartisan. I feel that with the left taking over, they are destroying this community. I don t want to become another Dearborn or a Hamtramck. And our elected officials are enabling this takeover,  he said.Hamtramck, just a few miles south of Sterling Heights, became the nation s first city with a Muslim-majority city council in 2016, and a large portion of Dearborn resembles a Middle Eastern country with signs in Arabic and women walking the streets with their faces veiled.He said it s not a matter of discrimination. Churches have been denied building projects in the past because their sites were too close to residential housing. They didn t get the federal government to sue the city; they simply picked another site. I truly believe this one man, Mr. Sessions, has the power to throw out any consent decree that was engineered by Obama s Department of Justice. That is our hope,  Mitchell said.  In fact, I know of hundreds of us who are praying for that opportunity to get it in Jeff Sessions  hands, before Tuesday night, because once it s signed, how do you overturn that? Signing it is tantamount to a consent that we re a bunch of bigots here in Sterling Heights. Calls to Sessions  press office went unanswered Monday as all federal offices were closed for President s Day. A stinger in the eye  of Iraqi Christians in Sterling HeightsMitchell said he and others are trying to get the word out in the community that the Tuesday council meeting will include an agenda item on a proposed settlement to the lawsuit.But the city council did not publish its Tuesday-night agenda in the local legal newspaper, the weekly Sterling Heights Sentry, and it didn t put a notice on its official website until late Friday. We just found out about this, so we ve been rushing to try to put together an opposition to stop the city from signing this document, which is an admission of guilt to something we don t think we committed,  Mitchell said.  As a local resident, I m gonna say we don t discriminate in Sterling Heights. We ve already got two mosques, a Sikh temple, a Buddhist temple and many other diverse houses of worship, so for this city to be called discriminatory is unbelievable. The unfortunate thing is, they want to plop it right in the middle of a Chaldean Christian neighborhood,  Mitchell added.  Somebody planned that. Somebody is seeking to put a stinger in someone s eye. Dr. Ramsay Dass, M.D., president of the American Middle East Christian Congress, said he is not so concerned about another mosque being built in Sterling Heights. He s more concerned about the big picture of political pressure being placed on small cities by an out-of-control federal bureaucracy using coercive tactics. As an American citizen, they are entitled to build a mosque, but I do not believe in making laws that small cities and towns cannot fight politically or financially,  Dass told WND.The federal law being used to coerce cities into approving mosques, even when the mosque is in a residential neighborhood, is the Religion Land Use and Institutional Persons Act, or RELUIPA, which was passed by Congress in 2000.As WND has reported, the Obama administration used this law increasingly against communities denying mosques and less against those denying the construction of churches.Nahren Anweya is a spokesperson for the persecuted Middle Eastern Christians living in Michigan. She has appeared on Fox News and spoken at congressional hearings on Christian persecution in the Middle East. Her family has been living in Michigan since they escaped Iraq in 1989. She said Sterling Heights is home to the nation s second largest Chaldean Catholic community of Iraqi Christians. They thought they found a safe haven, only to find out their ancient nemesis, the Middle Eastern Sunni Muslims, were being resettled in the same county and wanted to build a mosque right in the middle of their neighborhood.Most Iraqi Christians are either Chaldean Catholic or members of an even more ancient Christian sect, the Assyrian Church of the East. The Assyrians speak Aramaic, the language of Jesus. My family they re pretty patriotic American Assyrian Christians. Both of my great-grandfathers were crucified by Muslims literally on a cross,  Anweya told WND.  And that was because they were proud Christians, my great-grandfather used to walk around with a large gold cross around his neck, we never tried to hide it. So to see those ancient persecutors not only showing up in Macomb County en masse, but building a mosque on top of the Chaldean neighborhood, is  traumatizing,  Anweya said. While we are living in our safe haven, to allow a mosque to be built where we are is like putting us back to Iraq. We left everything behind to start from scratch, and then watching it follow us, this is traumatizing,  she said.  There are so many Muslim countries who could take these Muslim refugees, but they send them here. If we were treated fairly in their countries, then I would say let them build as many mosques as they want, but that day is far from reality. She said Muslim leaders don t believe in equality, and anything they say on that level is mere pandering to gullible local Christians. They don t believe in equality, even if they say they do,  she said.  Show me a Muslim country where Christians are treated 100 percent equal. Why is Christianity being degraded in every Muslim country? In 2003, we were 1.3 million Christians in Iraq, and that is where Christianity began and thrived, and now these are people who would be beheaded for their Christian faith. So, she said, the Assyrian and Chaldean communities have news for the Islamic centers that wish to build in their midst: These people are not going to give up their Christian faith,  Anweya said.  Where a nation is most vulnerable, is when they are not even calling themselves Christian anymore, that s the most dangerous I believe. When the sword is placed to your neck it s too late,  she added.  The Christians from Iraq, we are not building churches in Dearborn, so why are they building mosques in Sterling Heights? If we started building churches in Dearborn, I think you would see a few protests coming from them. Read more at:WND ",

        "text": "FBI Director James Comey met with the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday to discuss Donald Trump s claim that former President Obama had his  wires tapped  at Trump Tower during the election. A day later, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee said that he hasn t seen one shred of evidence to back up Trump s bogus claim.Rep. Adam Schiff is a member of what is known as the  Gang of Eight,  which is the group of House members who are privy to the most classified information out there. Schiff said that Thursday s meeting with Comey didn t provide the committee with any evidence whatsoever that Trump s phones had been tapped by Obama or anyone else. I think when Sean Spicer isn t even willing to talk about it, you know there s a real problem,  Schiff told CNN.Rep. Devin Nunes, who is the Republican heading up the intelligence committee, said earlier this week that he hadn t seen any evidence to support Trump s wiretapping claims either. After meeting with Comey, he said that nothing had changed.Comey has said previously that Trump is full of it when it comes to the allegations of his phones being tapped. Schiff thinks Comey will answer questions regarding this fiasco during a committee hearing scheduled for later this month. He certainly is prepared for the question,  Schiff told CNN.  I don t see any reason why he wouldn t answer it. He might even welcome the opportunity. Trump decided last weekend that he would get on Twitter and accuse Obama of tapping the phones at Trump Tower, even if he had no evidence to back up this allegation.Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my  wires tapped  in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  Donald J.

        "text": " In an effort to meet his weekly requirements of hypocrisy, Ted Cruz embraced the idea of a draconian federal law that would make it next to impossible for labor unions to function within America. Cruz called for a national  right to work  law, which would prevent unions from automatically collecting dues from employees that they cover. This would cause the labor unions to go bankrupt and make workers lose practically all of their collective bargaining power resulting in lower wages, worse working environments, and a reduction or loss of benefits.Hearing someone like Cruz, who completely embraces the idea of states  rights when it suits them, calling for a federal law to override all state-based labor union protections is a joke. Hypocrisy is not new to Cruz or Republicans, though. Cruz called for the law to protect the  fundamental rights  of employees. Common spin on legislation like this is that somehow the mandatory dues deducted from your paycheck to fund union representation are a violation of your rights as a worker.Apparently, the rights to collective bargaining and the fact you lose about 1500 dollars a year if you are non-union are completely lost to your average Republican legislator and voter. This is why these laws are regularly called  right to work for less. The sudden obsession with labor law is a strange diversion for Cruz, who worries more about finding ways to legalize discrimination and repeal Obamacare. The reason for it likely has less to do with allowing employers to steal money from their workers, and more with the fact he is trying to win the Wisconsin Republican primary.Cruz is echoing the only noteworthy thing Koch puppet Governor Scott Walker managed to do during his time as Governor of Wisconsin. Walker s entire claim to fame was being the corporate goon boy for attacks on labor unions. Despite his reasonable success in ruining labor unions in the state, Wisconsin still has some of the worst job prospects in America and shows no signs of serious improvement anytime soon. How advocating for a nationwide roll out of a huge Republican policy failure will help Cruz is anyone s guess. Republicans have voted for stupider things, though, so it could prove to be just the nudge Cruz needs to secure a win in Wisconsin.Featured image via (Photo by Spencer Platt /Getty Images)",

        "text": "What s a million dollars between friends? To hell with human rights violations Hillary s got a campaign to win!A major Clinton Foundation donor regularly arrests dissidents and brutally tortures them to extract confessions, according to a new report from Amnesty International.The New York Times reports that despite promises of reform, the Moroccan government continues to use  violent interrogation tactics  to  crush dissent. Moroccan King Mohammed VI recently hosted Bill and Chelsea Clinton at a Clinton Global Initiative conference in Marrakech, where guests were  chauffeured across the city to an opulent 56-room palace that boasts a private collection of Arabian horses, overlooks the snow-capped Atlas Mountains and serves a fine-dining menu of  biolight  cuisine,  according to the Washington Post.    During the conference Bill cited  Morocco s longstanding friendship to my family,  and thanked the king, who pledged as much as $500,000 toward the construction of the Clinton Library, as well as the OCP Corporation, a government-owned phosphate mining company that has donated at least $1 million to the Clinton Foundation. In interviews with POLITICO, former OCP miners described witnessing verbal and physical abuse doled out by the government against member of a minority advocating for independence in Western Sahara.Amnesty International secretary general Salil Shetty blasted the Moroccan government in a statement, saying:  Morocco s leaders portray the image of a liberal, human-rights-friendly country. But as long as the threat of torture hangs over detention and dissent that image will just be a mirage. According to the report, Moroccan dissidents are repeatedly subjected to  beatings, stress positions, asphyxiation, simulated drowning, psychological and sexual violence,  as a means of securing confessions for alleged crimes against the state. One tactic, known as the  roast chicken,  involves  suspending detainees from an iron bar by their wrists and knees. It is not known whether Bill Clinton met with any Moroccan detainees while hobnobbing at the Clinton Foundation event, which featured a  lavish palm-tree-lined golf resort with a cocktail reception featuring Moroccan hors d oeuvres and a saxophonist serenading about 50 donors.

        "text": "To think that Huma Abedin had access to top secret State Department documents is frightening. She and her family have super shady connections to radical Muslim groups. It s interesting that the local Muslim community would have such a controversial person in to make an appearance in Michigan. The denial continues but the FACTS are there that prove Abedin had no business being an insider in the State Department or the White House! As revelations broke in recent weeks regarding her role in a radical Muslim journal laced with anti-gay and anti-female comments, Huma Abedin quietly slipped in to Michigan for a visit to Dearborn Dearborn has the largest population of Muslims in America.The radical Muslim journal also employed her Mother, and was funded by the Saudis According to the Arab American News: Huma Abedin, vice chair for the Hillary for America campaign, met with Arab and Muslim American leaders on Aug. 11, to discuss issues that matter to the community.Community representatives included heads of organizations, small business owners, doctors, lawyers and other professions. U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Dearborn) and the retired dean of Congress, John Dingell, were also present at the discussion at Habib s Cuisine.Abedin was joined by Farooq Mitha, national director of Muslim Outreach for Hillary for America.Abedin praised the Muslim and Arab American communities for their political engagement. She highlighted the contrasts between Clinton and Trump.She said the Republican nominee uses divisive and inflammatory rhetoric against Muslims to divide our country, while Clinton embraces the values and contributions immigrants make to our country.IF SHE S CALLING  MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN  divisive and inflammatory rhetoric then so be it! There is nothing wrong with making America safe from terrorists and those who don t hold our beliefs. Abedin praised the patriotism and heroism of Muslims across the country, including the Khan family, a Muslim Gold Star family whose son, Captain Humayun Khan, was killed in Iraq while protecting his fellow service members.THE TRUTH ON THE KHAN FAMILY THAT HUMA ABEDIN CLAIMS EMBRACE OUR VALUES:HILLARY S  KHAN MAN : Who Is KHIZR KHAN? The SHOCKING Truth About His Job, His Ties To Hillary, Saudi Arabia And The Muslim BrotherhoodAbedin also discussed ways to strengthen communities, including making college more affordable (WHO PAYS FOR THIS?) , ensuring small businesses have the resources and support needed to succeed and building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top (REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH DOESN T WORK! WE VE HAD 8 YEARS WITH OBAMA!).Abedin answered individual questions from the audience. Abedin s publication is full of controversial statements.According to the New York Post:  Headlined  Women s Rights Are Islamic Rights,  a 1996 article argues that single moms, working moms and gay couples with children should not be recognized as families In a separate January 1996 article, Abedin s mother   who was the Muslim World League s delegate to the UN conference   wrote that Clinton and other speakers were advancing a  very aggressive and radically feminist  agenda that was un-Islamic and wrong because it focused on empowering women She seemed to rationalize domestic abuse as a result of  the stress and frustrations that men encounter in their daily lives.  While denouncing such violence, she didn t think it did much good to punish men for it. Via: WMP",

        "title": "Blood Sport: GOP Presidential Race Takes Another Brutal Turn As \u2018Party Favorites\u2019 Tear Into Trump",
        "text": "Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireAs Baron Rothschild famously said back in the late 18th century,  When there s blood in the streets, it s time to buy property.  Too bad then that Donald Trump has to divest all of his holdings and put them in the hands of a blind trust. On the scale of ugly, last night s debate was a moon shot even by this election s sinking standards.Both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz began their two hour-long sustained attack on the man in the middle, Donald Trump   relentlessly hitting the front-runner with every conceivable  gotcha  factoid and political angle. Trump hit back at Cruz calling him  a liar  and at Rubio calling the Florida Senator  choke artist  in reference to his meltdown at the hands of Chris Christie during the last televised debate. WAR: GOP rival Marco Rubio tearing into Donald Trump on an endless range of issues and supposed scandals.Clearly, CNN was also part of this coordinated attack, as they echoed Wall Street luminary and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, going after Trump about publicly releasing his tax returns. Trump then hit back saying that he s being audited by the IRS and can t release his returns in the middle of an audit (which is actually true), and CNN, along with Cruz, kept hammering the issue straight into the post-debate media opportunity where CNN ing nue Chris Cuomo tried (and failed) to channel his inner Tim Russert as he continued the Trump tax probe.It didn t end there. Subsequent gang stalking by Rubio and Cruz were powered by the New York Times (who s adopted a overwhelmingly anti-Trump editorial stance early on), including accusations of fraud over the Trump University civil court case, Trump using Polish building labor in 1980 (the same year that Rubio and Cruz were beginning second grade), and accusations of hypocrisy over Trump s use of used H-2B Visa applications to import seasonal labor to build in south Florida (that one turned out to be  nothing burger  though. Trump, a seasoned litigator, didn t seemed too worried about the Trump University case, intimating that  the lawyers are taking care of that , and the Polish builder scandal (come on guys, who doesn t like Polish builders?) happened 36 years ago.Forget about airs and graces. This was a vicious battle   a historic new low for American politics. The fact Trump survived the beating was something in itself. If he does make it through this storm, then both Cruz and Rubio will have done The Donald a huge favor   having vetted and exorcised all of his scandals early on during the primary stage, and leaving Hillary and the media with little besides bone to chew on come August.When today s morning press came out, exactly as they have throughout this election, all of the mainstream media channels, newspapers and magazine loudly declared Trump s  debate defeat , and trumpeted Rubio  aggressiveness . Liberal establishment stalwart The Atlantic declared,  Trump s Terrible night , while NBC News ran with the headline that  Rubio and Cruz Hammer Trump , followed by the Washington Post trumpeting,  Rubio Won Debate, Put Trump on the Defensive. Other wishful pundits weighed in, like media mogul Glenn Beck (who is openly backing Ted Cruz and warning his audiences of an end times Armageddon if America doesn t elect a  true Christian Conservative  in November). Beck was ecstatic after Rubio s debate performance, especially after this week when Trump gatecrashed a Nevada event where Beck was stumping for Cruz.Rubio is killing it.#gopdebate  Glenn Beck (@glennbeck) February 26, 2016This morning, Rubio drew additional fire from the Trump CENTCOM after Rubio claimed that Donald Trump had received $200 million from his father, and said if not for his father s  inheritance , Trump would be  selling watches in Manhattan. This morning Rubio appeared at an outdoor media event where he tore into Trump, calling him a  con artist  and went on the pick apart Trump s spelling mistakes on Twitter. At this point, you just got the feeling that Rubio has ventured into a new area of media warfare outside of his own sanitized political wheelhouse. As the old saying goes: never wrestle with a pig.In the end, it was Trump who stole the wind from Rubio s sails, when early the following morning he appeared on national TV next to firebrand GOP candidate, Chris Christie, garnering a power midstream endorsement from the popular New Jersey governor. RENT-A-CROWD? Critics have pointed out that Rubio s crowds appear as props for the camera, as seen at this morning s Rubio rally in Texas.Crowds For Hire?With so many people disengaged from mainstream politics and from major broadcast media, politicians are said to be turning to PR agencies and  rent-a-crowd  services in order to fill out their camera frames and look more appealing to audiences. More than any other previous presidential election cycle, this 2016 race has seen more accusations of this   leveled mainly at GOP candidates like Jeb Bush   but also towards Marco Rubio. At this morning s media event, Rubio s team had hand-picked dozens of youths and immaculately dressed made up crowds   carefully assembled in rows behind and directly below Rubio. Interestingly, the teen models and the gangsters do not cheer with the core crowd positioned between the cameras and Rubio   they simply smile, and many of these people are wearing sunglasses   on an overcast morning in Texas. Even hip hop gangster-looking students wearing color-coordinated red hoodies   many of whom are even too young to vote, appear disinterested, as if they are being paid $40 to stand in a row in the camera frame.If this is any indication of Rubio s  New American Century , then it s certainly cause for worry. The fact that Rubio stole his campaign slogan from Donald Rumsfeld and John Bolton s neoconservative pro-war think tank, Project for A New American Century (PNAC) is interesting, and the fact the media have not commented yet on this is highly suspect.Ironically, it was the brash hawk Donald Trump who took the high ground on the issue of the Middle East. When asked about his commitment to Israel, Trump pointed out that he would not take sides beforehand when brokering any peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and even stated that if he could negotiate a peace deal between the perennial warring neighbors that,  It would be my greatest achievement as US president.  Who can really argue with that? Well, hermanos Cubanos did. Cruz and Rubio were furious at this point, and the reason for this has to be that both of them have received mucho dinero from the Israeli Lobby to maintain a categorically anti-Palestinian stance. Cruz and Rubio adopted a very ugly tone during this exchange, both telegraphing their commitment to the decrepit status quo   meaning that there would be no peace in the Middle East on their watch. Once again, Cruz and Rubio are completely out of touch with what voters really want.Almost one year ago I said on the SUNDAY WIRE SHOW that the Republican establishment would be looking to hedge its approach to returning to the White House more than they have in past elections   this time going for the mathematical and demographically pragmatic option   which would be Marco Rubio, with Wisconsin s Scott Walker throwing early innings in the bull pen. Orthodox RNC thinking last spring believed that with Rubio, with less than one term in Senate and no leadership experience, could somehow repeat the  Obama effect  of 2008 and finally usher their party into the 21st century. Things looked very different for Hillary last spring too, where she seemed invincible on the Democrat side as well as in national polling. On paper at least, it seems that Rubio would  tick all the right boxes  for the GOP elite who are presiding over a party in decline and disarray   he s young (44 years old, although you d punt him at a decade his junior), and even more importantly he s Latino, which gives the GOP a shot a pulling in a crucial trilateral voter compliment: Hispanic-American, independents and moderate Democrats. On paper this all makes perfect sense, but running for President in the United States of America isn t simply a case of what looks logical on paper. Case and point: Bernie Sanders, Ben Carson and, of course, Donald Trump.CurtainsIf Cruz loses his home state Texas GOP primary on March 1st, then it s lights out for the Cruz campaign. Right now Cruz and Trump are in a dead heat, nearly tied in the pre-polling, with Cruz a few points ahead. Ditto for Rubio in his home state Florida s GOP primary on March 15th. Currently, Trump is burying Rubio by an average of 15+ points in every poll for Florida. Birther issues aside, this has always been the knock against both Rafael Edward  Ted  Cruz (photo, left) and Marco Rubio: just like Barack Obama, they are too young and with no real experience governing, and like Obama, destined to become party functionaries.Trump supporters will often point out that while their man was building skyscrapers in Manhattan, both Cruz and Rubio were still scraping their knees playing dodge ball in junior high. Putting this into perspective, it s hard to take a junior politician seriously when they talk about  restoring America . Like him or hate him, Trump has a long list of achievements and powerful relationships, and has actually created jobs. As much as politicians tell us that their successive administrations have conjured  job creation , the truth is that Americans no longer believe this lie, and millions now see Donald J. Trump as the antidote to that institutional fib. If you polled Americans today and asked them: would you rather live on government assistance or build your own company and be independently wealthy (?), it s fairly certain that the overwhelming majority of Americans would choose the latter   even if it meant risking everything. Trump understands this dynamic better than any other candidate because for him, it s not a theoretical proposition. In essence this is the American Dream, and therein lies the disconnect for both career politicians Rubio and Cruz, and perhaps for Hillary Clinton too, should she face-off against Trump later on.Despite the mainstream media insistence that Marco Rubio  won  Thursday night s debate, and  Ted Cruz looked  strong , it s fairly clear that both candidates are now relying on negative attacks and cruel swipes, in effect, trying to out-Trump The Donald. If that s their main strategic directive   and mind you we haven t even reached super Tuesday yet   then it s fair to say we are looking at the final desperate lunges of two highly over-inflated political marketing exercises. Their double team might have impressed a few media gatekeepers, but in the end it didn t make the Cuban pair look presidential. At this stage of the race, looking presidential is important, but when you re desperately playing catch-up you simply can t afford to look presidential, according to Rubio and Cruz anyway. Just another example of how short-term logic rules this race.Meanwhile, the media continue to scratch their heads and quietly panic (think of all the retractions and back pedaling if Trump wins) as Trump continues to win primaries and scoop-up delegates on his way towards a Republican nomination.Watch Rubio s somewhat vain attempt at gutter politics this morning in Texas:   It was amusing to watch CNN interrogators, along with Rubio and Cruz, lay into Trump about his lack of specifics on his healthcare plan. Trump stuck to his canned lines, and generalities, and lost no ground with his supporters either. It should also be said voters don t really care about hearing policy details either, as the population has finally copped on to the fact that candidates will say anything to get elected and that no president will ever make good on his or her campaign promises. Eight years of Obama taught America that lesson once and for all.Throughout the CNN event, Trump would point out individual corporate lobbyists in the audience from various industries including the pharmaceutical industry. The fact of the matter here is, despite painting themselves as rebels and  DC outsiders , both Rubio and Cruz made it on the stage by taking millions of dollars from various Washington DC lobbies. The same special interests have poured fortunes into Super PACs which are presently funding Cruz and Rubio s presidential campaigns and paying for all of their million dollar TV ad slots. Trump, on the other hand, is funding his own campaign and is not bought and paid for.Collectively, between Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, Rick Perry, John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, hundreds of millions of dollars have been donated, invested and spent   in order to try and inflate a bloated GOP field   and give lift-off to each one of these political balloons. As it stands now, all of this money will have been spent in vain. The only winners will be the media consultants and PR companies who produced mountains campaign ads and printed material, and also the TV networks, like CNN, FOX and the others, who ran all of those costly political ads.Towards the end of CNN s gladiatorial event last night, Trump got the last word, and again, it reflected the public mood and thus will further galvanize his support base. He exclaimed: Politicians are all talk, no action   just like these two here (Cruz and Rubio)  Look what s happening to our country. Trade, vets, common core, Obamacare: I ll get it done, they won t, and we will Make America Great Again. Once again, it s not a question of whether voters believe everything he says, or like everything he does. Just as Jimmy Carter was to cure for Nixon s epic corruption, and the Simple Jack approach of George W. Bush was the beneficiary of Bill Clinton s shameful antics in the Oval office, and just as Barack Obama was the natural reaction to the nation s WMD shame and intellectual inadequacy of two terms of George W. Bush   so too is Donald Trump the natural progression following eight years of divisive partisan  lead from behind  community organizer-in-chief politics by Barack Obama.If Trump does win the nomination in July, then this general election will be one of the most rancorous contests in American history.  The real fun has only just begun.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",

        "text": "Republicans found their new election year wedge issue. Since they lost on Obamacare, marriage equality, and Benghazi, the new rage source they identified is  Harriet Tubman being placed on the $20 bill.This is the new big deal. It s practically an attack on the Constitution itself. Right?It certainly seems to be for Republicans, at least. So many people on the right are exploding over the idea of replacing Jackson on the $20 bill now. However, this isn t new news. This has been planned for a relatively long time. They KNEW this was coming, and there was no outrage   right up until someone who was both non-white and non-male was going to do the replacing.Luckily, Fox News  Greta Van Susteren came up with the perfect response. Her plan is to leave white people s money as it is and make separate money for non-whites. No, that s not a joke. She literally said we should make a new $25 bill so that Jackson could stay in place.Let s do a bit of critical thinking, based on a bit of history. A Susan B. Anthony dollar coin was released by the government a long time ago. EVERYBODY hated it. Not only did it look like a quarter, and people got confused by that, but it was redundant. We already had a $1 bill that everyone was accustomed to. Not every cash register has room for a new bill slot either. Certain types of automated bill changing machines would have to be retrofit for a $25 bill as well.The point is that a whole new denomination of money would be an annoyance and hassle, and the public would not have any patience for it. To put it into context, America has had a $2 bill with Thomas Jefferson on it for a really long time. Do you know ANYONE who uses them? Do you even remember the last time you saw one outside of some novelty situation for collectors?To sum it up, the Republican party thinks that the only place for a woman or a non-white person when it comes to money, is on something that will be marginalized by society   Just like how they ve marginalized women and non-white people for decades! It really makes a lot of sense when you look at it that way.

Along with a lesson in the love Christ taught in all of his messages, the minister names off an impressive list of Christ s churches who preach it as well. Equality is NOT something people who actually worship Christ oppose. People who use his name to promote fear and ignorance are the worst kind of hypocrites.

Representative Scalise is a friend, and my heart goes out to him and his family. Steve and I wish him and the others wounded a speedy recovery. They remain in our thoughts and prayers.

It also appears that the suspect targeted members of Congress specifically because he disagreed with their views. Hodgkinson s social media posts indicate he was a supporter of Sen.

It just doesn t make sense. 21st Century Wire says This latest report serves as a reminder of just how thin the US-led international game of supporting extremist militants has become.The most comical part of this story is how US military court scribes at the Associated Press are still in denial that Iraqis are harboring ill will against the US for suffocating (via crippling sanctions), bombing and destroying, looting and occupying their country over the last 25 years.Aside from numerous reports showing US weapons and equipment being dropped  by accident  and then used by ISIS, it s undeniable by now that the US have been the primary driver in fueling the rise and growth of this militant fighting group over the last 7 years.Associated Press writers are very careful to frame this narrative and advance the establishment s favorite meme that the debacle of Iraq was down to US  government incompetence , rather than inherent malice   even though history clearly demonstrates that malice has been omnipresent in US foreign policy for at least the last 70 years.SEE ALSO: 50 Years of Targeted  Kill Lists  by US Government Why can t they (the Iraqis) appreciate what we ve done for them?

Newspapers and TV networks repeat conspiracy theories that the U.S. created the jihadi group to sow chaos in the region in order to seize its oil.Skepticism about U.S. motives is deeply rooted in Iraq, where many still blame the chaos after the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein on American malice rather than incompetence Read more at Military.comREAD MORE ISIS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire ISIS Files",

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2016Burning the flag is a form of expression that is protected by the Constitution.

Even Fox legal analyst Andrew Napolitano blasted Trump for his blatantly unconstitutional statement.But Trump also pissed off someone else.George Takei also went after Trump.

There are people who have been mistreated under our flag in this country. Taking away their right to express their anger would only marginalize people and that is not right.Takei wasn t done though.

That means honoring and protecting free speech.  George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) November 29, 2016A lot of people may find the act of burning the flag reprehensible and that s their right. But there are also those who see burning a flag as a message to the government in opposition of a policy or a lack of action to fix an issue. Silencing this form of expression would be tyrannical.

        "text": "As the GOP s fight to control which bathrooms transgender people can and can t use continues, one of their main talking points has been how  dangerous  it is for trans individuals to be allowed to use the same restrooms as women and children.Despite how false that argument is (there have literally been NO instances where a transgender person has assaulted someone while using the restroom that matched their gender identity), this misleading stance actually sweeps an extremely important issue under the rug   who the majority of sex offenders really are.Chad Butler, the District Attorney of Nashville, Tennessee, has prosecuted hundreds of sex crimes and has found the recent anti-trans  bathroom laws  in states like North Carolina extremely frustrating. In speaking to WSMV Channel 4, Butler revealed that throughout the entire length of his long career, he has never prosecuted a case against a trans individual. Not one. So who are the real threats? Butler says that sexual predators are overwhelmingly  heterosexual men. As long as I ve been doing this job and the hundreds of cases I ve reviewed, I ve never once had a transgender person come across my desk as an offender. Butler believes that the ongoing arguments over transgender people s bathroom rights actually distract the public from real dangers. Specializing in crimes against children, Butler revealed that although these discriminatory anti-trans laws are supposedly meant to protect children, they don t. The real threat, he says, are the people the children come in contact with every day. Butler said: A majority of my cases are fathers, stepfathers, uncles, Boy Scout leaders, coaches, youth ministers, preachers. People that are already close to the family that the family trusts. Butler called the claim that trans people are a threat to children statistically unfounded and off base.  These accusations only encourage parents to be weary of the wrong people. It is actually very frustrating because it sort of takes the dialogue and the conversation away from where it should be. What Butler believes WILL actually keep children safe, is open discussions about consent and sexual abuse at an early age. Butler says that one of the most important things parents can do is educate their children, and believe them if they come forward because more times than not, children are molested by someone close to the family. A child is more likely to be sexually assaulted in their own bathroom than a public restroom by a stranger.

        "text": "Many of us have been ready to impeach Donald Trump since election night. However, the downside to this scenario was the prospect of Vice President Mike Pence taking his place. Well, thanks to the testimony of former FBI Director James Comey, we may not have to worry about ending up with President Pence when we finally manage to get rid of Trump.On Thursday, Comey testified about how Trump had pressured him to drop his investigation into Mike Flynn s shady Russian ties and tried to back him into a loyalty pledge. Buried in his testimony, which contained one bombshell after another, was this little tidbit: Pence, who was the head of Trump s transition team, knew damn well that Flynn was compromised by not one but two foreign governments   and he allowed him to be named National Security Adviser anyway. In a moment that went largely unnoticed, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) asked Comey if Pence was aware of Flynn s connections to Russia. The former head of the FBI said that yes, Pence knew. He apparently just didn t care. My understanding is that he was,  Comey replied, adding that he got this information from then acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who also ended up fired after angering Trump.This statement may become very important in coming months as we move closer and closer towards impeaching Trump. If Pence was in on all of this then he is just as dirty as Trump and the rest of his crooked cronies. If there was anybody who still thought that maybe Pence is just too oblivious to what s going on around him to notice all the shady sh*t, Comey just cleared that up with his testimony. Pence knew. He knew and still allowed Flynn to have access to our country s most sensitive information.

        "title": " This Reporter Just Won The Biggest Prize In Journalism For Exposing Trump\u2019s Lies (DETAILS)",
        "text": "The winners of the 2017 Pulitzer Prize have been announced and this year s theme was all about exposing Trump.Of particular note was the prize for National Reporting going to David A. Fahrenthold of The Washington Post, whose contribution to reporting during the presidential campaign was to unflinchingly go after Trump s lies, particularly as they related to his contributions to charity.As the Pulitzer committee put it, Fahrenthold deserved the award:For persistent reporting that created a model for transparent journalism in political campaign coverage while casting doubt on Donald Trump s assertions of generosity toward charities.During a campaign when many reporters and pundits struggled to keep up with Trump s lies, or pretended Trump wasn t lying at all, Fahrenthold decided to hold Trump s feet to the fire. After Trump repeatedly dodged questions about his donations to charity, Fahrenthold compiled an exhaustive list of charities Trump was said to have given money to and painstakingly eliminated each one. In the end, the reporting showed that Trump was perhaps one of the least charitable rich people in the country. He also ran down individual anecdotes exposing Trump has a showboating opportunist who cynically exploited charity events for PR but avoided giving any money.In one example discovered by Fahrenthold, Trump stagecrashed an event meant to honor donors, stole the seat of a legitimate donor and then left before anyone knew what had just happened. Nobody knew he was coming,  said Abigail Disney, another donor sitting on the dais.  There s this kind of ruckus at the door, and I don t know what was going on, and in comes Donald Trump. [He] just gets up on the podium and sits down. Trump was not a major donor. He was not a donor, period. He d never given a dollar to the nursery or the Association to Benefit Children, according to Gretchen Buchenholz, the charity s executive director then and now.It is for exposing stories like this and others that Fahrenthold has become reviled in the Trump White House and in conservative circles. He does what fearless journalism has always done: Speak truth to power.Hilariously, Farhrenthold isn t the only person to win the prestigious award for his coverage of Trump. Miami Herald cartoonist Jim Morin earned a Pulitzer for equally biting criticism of Trump. To highlight the point, his latest cartoon is a particularly brutal take down of Trump.Another loudmouth draft-dodging sanctimonious hypocrite phony patriot republican sending us to war #morintoon #TrumpSyria #ChemicalAttack pic.twitter.com/YHXtRaRff3  Jim Morin (@MorinToon) April 8, 2017And the New York Times took home the international reporting Pulitzer for coverage that also caused Trump no shortage of headaches. The paper exposed the rampant corruption and cruelty of the Putin regime in Russia. This made things extremely awkward for Trump. He, of course, benefited greatly from Putin s willingness to undermine democracy   specifically America s 2016 election. Trump has also praised the autocrat as a strong leader and at one time claimed him as a friend.It s extremely telling that so many of the top honors went to people who either directly or indirectly stood up to Trump s administration   whether it be clear-eyed reporting on the corruption from within the White House or the disastrous effects of the policies they and their allies in Congress have forced upon the country. In dark days, fearless critical reporting is more valuable than ever. And with Trump already threatening to crank up censorship laws, it s a rare and powerful commodity.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",

It s no wonder these people are repeat offenders!A hispanic store owner testified in court through a Spanish translator (Why no English?) that he swindled the American tax payers out of millions via food stamp fraud. Eduardo Leonardo plead guilty to stealing from the USDA by illegally exchanging over a million dollars of food stamp benefits for cash for over two years. I stole from the USDA and the Food and Nutrition Service,  Eduardo Leonardo said slowly in Spanish through a translator in Brooklyn Federal Court.  It was an exchange of benefits for cash. Leonardo, 57,  admitted to committing  food stamp  fraud between Oct. 2015 and March 2017 by giving customers cash in exchange for running their EBT cards for a higher amount, which the federal government would later reimburse.In one instance, an undercover witness from the USDA went into Super Economic and picked up a jar of peanut butter and jelly and crackers, totaling $5.48. The witness then asked Leonardo to exchange benefits for $200 cash and Leonardo charged an undercover EBT card $287.89 and gave the witness $200 in cash, making a $82.41 profit.The USDA lost a total of $1,116,924.27 in the transactions.The scammer has run his store, Super Economic One Way Supermarket out of 104-21 Glenwood Road in Canarsie since Dec. 2011. It became a registered SNAP business on May 25, 2012. Specifically I gave a discounted rate in cash in exchange for them [customers] allowing me to ring up the full amount,  Leonardo said to Judge Ann Donnelly.Remember Ann Donnelly?Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) previously called the  food stamp program,  uses federal tax dollars to aid low-income households in buying affordable and nutritious food. EBT cards are used like debit cards, to swipe at special terminals in retail food stores to use the benefits in exchange for food.Between Nov. 2015 and Jan. 2017, Super Economic conducted more than 57,000 SNAP transactions totaling more than $1.5 million, according to court documents.About 8 transactions were made for $50 or more, an amount that USDA officials say is high for a store that size, which would normally conduct $15 average transactions.Leonardo is set to be sentenced on Oct. 31 and could face a maximum five years in prison WHAAAAT????THIS IS WHY THIS KEEPS HAPPENING!A man swindles more than a million dollars from Americans yet he gets only 5 years in prison?

What they shouldn t do is panic.That s because regardless of how prices react on Nov. 9, next-day moves in the S&P 500 Index are useless in telling what comes after.While the index swings an average 1.5 percent the day after the vote, gains or losses over the first 24 hours predict the market s direction 12 months later less than half the time.This matters because the compulsion to act in the vote s aftermath is often very strong   stocks swing twice as violently as normal those days, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They plummeted 5 percent just after Barack Obama beat John McCain in 2008. But while nothing says Wednesday s reaction won t be a harbinger for the year, nothing says it will, either, and investors should think before doing anything rash.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 13, 2016The article that has Trump throwing a temper tantrum that primarily focuses on failed attempts to pivot Trump more towards the middle. Allegedly, there has been a concentrated effort in the Trump campaign to tone down his rhetoric, and those efforts have failed. A strategy like this is fairly typical in a switch from running in a primary campaign to running in a general election. If you re a Republican, you need to position yourself to the right of your opponent(s) to rally the GOP s conservative base. Then, in the general, you move towards the middle to appeal to swing voters.However, it s Trump, so he took umbrage with the New York Times article s reporting on the matter, saying,  The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2016Like most Trump Twitter outbursts, it can be hard to examine such obviously flawed logic seriously. Sure, there a lot of problems with mainstream media coverage. However, those problems have only worked to help Trump. The press loves a gaffe, and Trump fires them off like a right-winger who just got his hands on their first AR-15. It s lead to him receiving an incredible number of free media play. It s what made his campaign what it is today. However, this is a general election and that strategy just does not cut it.Now is the time for Trump to act like a real politician. Since Trump doesn t have any experience governing or running for office, he s failing. Trump cannot recover, so all he has left is vague conspiracies to blame. Never mind the fact that Trump has blackballed major and small media outlets for his entire campaign. Never mind the fact that he started a feud with gold star family.

That s what the FBI wants to know. This may be a very, very serious national security investigation. We ve been reporting this scandal for months but it s just now heating up. The most of the main stream media has been silent on this serious national security breach within the DNC. The FBI is investigating who was given top secret information by the DNC IT workers who had email access to everyone in Congress!The puzzling part of this entire scandal is that the payment was outrageous! Over $4 million was given to this family and associates!THE DAILY CALLER REPORTED ON THIS BREACH OF SECURITY WAY BACK IN FEBRUARY WHEN THE BROTHERS WERE FIRED:Three brothers who managed office information technology for members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and other lawmakers were abruptly relieved of their duties on suspicion that they accessed congressional computers without permission.Brothers Abid, Imran, and Jamal Awan were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives Thursday, The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group has learned.Three members of the intelligence panel and five members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs were among the dozens of members who employed the suspects on a shared basis. The two committees deal with many of the nation s most sensitive issues and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism.Also among those whose computer systems may have been compromised is Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida Democrat who was previously the target of a disastrous email hack when she served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 campaign.The brothers are suspected of serious violations, including accessing members  computer networks without their knowledge and stealing equipment from Congress.Jamal handled IT for Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat who serves on both the intelligence and foreign affairs panels. As of 2/2, his employment with our office has been terminated,  Castro spokeswoman Erin Hatch told TheDCNF Friday.Jamal also worked for Louisiana Democrat Rep. Cedric Richmond, who is on the Committee on Homeland Security.Imran worked for Reps. Andre Carson, an Indiana Democrat, and Jackie Speier, a California Democrat. Both are members of the intelligence committee, and their spokesmen did not respond to TheDCNF s requests for comment. Imran also worked for the House office of Wasserman Schultz.Then-Rep. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, employed Abid for IT work in 2016. She was a member of House committees dealing with the armed services, oversight, and Benghazi.

        "text": "From the amazing Ann Corcoran s Refugee Resettlement blog: Ho hum! Another of those Somalis we are still bringing into America as refugees at the rate of 800-900 a month has been indicted in Columbus, the city second only to Minneapolis as a city being colonized by a large population of Somali Muslim refugees (thanks to those  religious  non-profits hired by the federal government to place them!).This latest jihadist came here as a child and your tax dollars helped raise him! (I ll have more tomorrow, just wanted to get the news out while it s hot!) Stay tuned A 23-year-old resident of Columbus, Ohio, who trained with a group affiliated with al Qaeda has been arrested and charged with plotting an attack on American soil, the Justice Department revealed today.Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, a naturalized American citizen of Somali descent, had been instructed by a cleric to return to the United States and carry out an act of terrorism, the indictment said.The Justice Department stated that Mohamud was also an Islamic State sympathizer, and that his brother, Abdifatah Aden, was killed fighting with the group in Syria in 2013.According to court documents, Mohamud left the US a year ago with the intent to go to Syria and train with a terrorist group linked to al Qaeda in Iraq.In April 2014, he purchased a one-way ticket to Greece, but during a layover in Istanbul he failed to board a connecting flight to Athens and instead made his way to Syria.Once he reached his destination, Mohamud stated that he received training in shooting weapons, breaking into houses, explosives and hand-to-hand combat.The 23-year-old Columbus man aloes said that after completing his training, a cleric with the group Jabhat al-Nusrah instructed him to return to the US and commit an act of terror.The 23-year-old returned to the US in June 2014 with a plot to attack a military base or a correctional facility, targeting people in uniform, according to court documents. Mohamud talked about doing something big in the United States,  the papers cited by ABC News indicate.  He wanted to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers execution style. On Thursday, Mohamud was indicted on one count of attempting to provide and providing material support to terrorists, one count of attempting to provide and providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and one count of making false statements to the FBI.The first two counts, providing material support to terrorists and providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization are each crimes punishable by up to 15 years in prison.Making false statements involving international terrorism carries a maximum sentence of eight years in prison.Mohamud was arrested on state charges February 21, 2015, and is expected to be transferred into federal custody based on today s indictment.Before Mohamud s brother was killed in battle on or around June 3, 2014, the two had exchanged emails discussing the 23-year-old s plans to travel to Syria and fight with Islamic State. In February, Mohamud asked Abdifatah Aden how he could send him money.Later that month, Mohamud was arrested at his Columbus home for allegedly providing a computer tablet an other material support to terrorist organizations abroad.Prosecutor Ron O Brien at the time asked a judge to set Mohamud s bond at $1million saying he was a flight risk and posed a threat to public safety.Mohamud s attorney, Sam Shamansky, insisted that his client was not a terrorist and would not flee because he was taking care of his ailing mother in Ohio.Via: UK Daily Mail ",

        "text": "It s been several months, and hundreds of hours of rallies, since the last time scientists took a hard look at Donald Trump s intelligence, and the new data did not help the Republican front runner look any smarter.In a new analysis of the language Trump uses, scientists discovered that he is talking to his supporters at a 5th grade level   the lowest of any candidate in the race.The study, done by the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, seems to confirm what an earlier, albeit less scientific, analysis by the Boston Globe found: Donald Trump has either the language development of an 11-year-old child, or he thinks his supporters do.The results can often times be laughably bad. Here, for example, is an answer Trump gave to Jimmy Kimmel when asked to defend his call to ban Muslims from the United States. He falls into a Rubio-esque repeat of the same two or three meaningless sentences: Look, we have people coming into our country that are looking to do tremendous harm. You look at the two   look at Paris. Look what happened in Paris. I mean, these people, they did not come from Sweden, okay? Look at what happened in Paris. Look at what happened last week in California, with, you know, 14 people dead. Other people going to die, they re so badly injured. And when he gets flustered, not only does his grammar go out the window, but so does his ability to spell. He winds up shooting off angry tweets like this one which contain astoundingly misspelled words.\"one of the dummer people on television\" pic.twitter.com/JP6zZpxelb  James Cook (@JamesLiamCook) June 25, 2015@BigDaveBets @realDonaldTrump you know there a thousand screenshots just like this one lol. pic.twitter.com/En6k9dwS6B  Ricky Spanisssssssh (@micahsgrrl) February 26, 2016The study also looked at past presidents to compare how the new crop stacks up. The researchers found that while most candidates were around the average, there were two notable exceptions   Donald Trump and George W. Bush   circling the very bottom.George W. Bush, of course, is well known for having been one of America s least intellectual presidents. He was voted into office largely because he was a guy Republicans wanted to  have a beer with  and not because he had the brain power to effectively do the job. In fact, his legendary stupidity was used as a selling point. He wasn t an  elitist  because he didn t (or couldn t) use big words and never excelled in school. His opponent, Al Gore, his supporters claimed was too smart. A major turn off for them.Trump seems to be banking on the same anti-intellectual thinking. The simpler the words, the more they adore him. What his fans don t remember is that Bush s ability to be fun in a bar didn t translate into a good presidency. He left America in an historic recession and multiple wars. A bit more thinking would have been nice.Featured image via Flickr ",

        "text": "The liberals find this plan to be disgusting until their neighborhoods become the next victim of violent muslim immigrant gangs of course Anti-immigration campaigners in Gullberg in southern Sweden are plotting to build a pig farm next to an asylum centre in a last-ditch effort to deter would-be Muslim immigrants, who might find the animals offensive.More illegal immigrants on the run in Sweden (03 May 15) Swedish Syrian warms hearts over phone return (08 Apr 15)  It was a long journey and some of my friends died  (30 Mar 15)Plans for a new immigration centre in Gullberg have already been strongly opposed by local residents and on Wednesday it was reported that a group of campaigners had sent a letter to the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) pledging to breed pigs nearby in order to deter Muslims from seeking asylum in the town.The note, signed by what described itself as the  interest group for Gullberg s survival  said that it was trying to create a  probably impossible situation for some religious people, especially Muslims , according to Sveriges Radio.Local politician Henry Sandahl from Sweden s Countryside Party (Markbygdspartiet) told the broadcaster that he agreed with the sentiment of the letter. You know that Muslims are not friends with pigs,  he said.But Swedish religious experts have been quick to criticize the campaigners. This is nonsense and shows just how very little they know about Islam,  said  ke Sander, Professor of Psychology at the University of Gothenburg. It is one thing when Muslims try to stay away from pork, alcohol or gambling but there is nothing [in the Koran] that says you cannot be near pigs. This is a last-ditch effort when they [the campaigners] have no arguments left,  he told the TT news agency.Others turned to social media to voice their disgust at the campaign.Carl G ransson, a lawyer and former Moderate party politician suggested on Twitter that building  a gigantic rubbish dump  next to the asylum centre instead, designed to blow smelly winds in the direction of the angry residents. Monstrous  and a  total fail , wrote Johan Arenius, a political press secretary for the Christian Democrat party based in  rebro in central Sweden.Sweden became the first European country in 2013 to grant automatic residency to Syrian refugees and has since seen asylum requests rise to record levels, which are still expected to reach about 90,000 in 2015.To cope with an increasing flow of refugees, the Swedish Migration Board announced in March that it was more than tripling the maximum number of residents allowed at asylum centres from 200 to 650.Via: The Local seh/t Refugee Resettlement Watch",

        "text": "Crooked Hillary has always been crooked. She s just been better than anyone America s ever seen at not getting caught On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is  rigged. Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,  said Sen. Clinton.  And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. Chomsky recalls being taken aback that  anyone could support the idea offered by a national political leader, no less that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections. Some eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency.For entire story: Observer",

To date, Maxwell is the only MLB player who has chosen to disrespect our flag as a way to help BLM push an anti-cop movement.Here is the Oakland A s response to Bruce Maxwell kneeling during our nation s national anthem:pic.twitter.com/EHXwg8Zpax  A's, But Spooky   (@Athletics) September 24, 2017Last week, Maxwell was caught lying about being denied service at a local restaurant after kneeling for the anthem.FOX News   Oakland A s catcher Bruce Maxwell, 26, claimed this week that a waiter in his Alabama hometown of Huntsville refused him service after identifying him as the MLB player who took the knee during  The Star Spangled Banner  last month   only the waiter has a very different version of events and he told Fox News that was far from what went down. He is outright lying. This is really upsetting as he was given full service, I didn t even know who Bruce Maxwell was,  Matt Henry, a 42-year-old waiter at Keegan s Public House, told Fox News.  This all started because I carded his friend who wanted to order a beer. According to Henry, an Alabama native, Maxwell was dining with local Democratic councilman Devyn Keith and another friend who produced an expired ID, and the server refused to serve him a drink   which upset the friend, who followed him into the kitchen. He asked me,  Don t you know who Bruce Maxwell is? , and told me I was making everyone feel uncomfortable. Nobody was even paying attention to them,  Henry claimed. I didn t know anything about him or the kneeling. All I know is a friend of mine 15 years ago lost his job for serving someone a drink who happened to be underage, so if anyone looks under 30, I m going to card them. The waiter said that the councilman then complained to the restaurant s manager about Maxwell being uncomfortable, and the manager simply swapped me to another table, and that it was  no big deal. The restaurant manager on duty that day, Anne Whalen   who requested the restaurant name not be used without permission from the owner   also told Fox News that Maxwell s story being portrayed in the media could not be further from the truth. Matt came to me and told me that a guy wanted a beer but his ID was not valid and I told him he absolutely could not give it to him, we can go to jail for that in the state of Alabama,  the manager said. It was his friend causing all the fuss, none of us even knew who this baseball player was. I told him I had no idea who he was going on about,  she said.  Eventually Matt just asked if we could put another server on the table so I did.   I can t believe the story. Today, it was announced that Maxwell was arrested in Arizona after a food delivery person told authorities that he pointed a gun at her.TMZ  Scottsdale PD tells us Maxwell, 26, was arrested Saturday at 6:08 PM at his Scottsdale, AZ home. Cops say the alleged victim was a female food delivery driver who told them Maxwell pointed a gun at her.It s unclear what led up to the incident.SPD says Maxwell was booked on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and disorderly conduct.Cops say he is in custody and awaiting his initial appearance in front of a judge.

        "text": "This is disgraceful and totally un-American.Ronald Reagan is rolling in his grave after a new poll revealed that Republicans now see Russia as our friend and admire Vladimir Putin far more than we did just two years ago.A YouGov/Economist poll released in December shows that Putin s favorability has soared by 56 points among Republicans, likely bolstered by the fact that Russia helped Donald Trump win the election in November. Clearly, Republicans can be bought by murderous dictators as long as that dictator helps their party seize power.Trump specifically asked the Russians to continue meddling in our political process and they did. Trump has since stacked his cabinet with pro-Russia nominees and Republicans have joined Trump in defending Russia despite a CIA assessment concluding that Russia did interfere in our election to help Trump.Putin s net favorability among Republicans now stands at -10 percent, up significantly from the -66 in 2014. Democrats, meanwhile, still despise Putin.Um, wow Net favorability of Putin:Democrats July 2014: -54 Dec 2016: -62Republicans July 2014: -66 Dec 2016: -10(YouGov/Economist)  Will Jordan (@williamjordann) December 14, 2016Here is Republicans and Democrats on Vladimir Putin since July 2014. pic.twitter.com/s4I6FY5cbt  Will Jordan (@williamjordann) December 14, 2016In addition, Republicans now see Russia as a friend. Again, apparently it is easy to draw Republicans to the dark side. If Russia had rigged our political process decades ago, that whole Cold War thing would not have happened because Russia would have had a puppet in the White House long before now.It s not just Putin.Here are perceptions about whether Russia is a friend to the US or not, since 2011. pic.twitter.com/CrtVEB4Vws  Will Jordan (@williamjordann) December 14, 2016As a net rating, the  friendly  rating for Russia among Republicans has swung from low of -75 in 2014 to -21 today. https://t.co/PrbOLQFY5a  Will Jordan (@williamjordann) December 14, 2016That s also a 54-point swing from two years ago.It is absolutely deplorable to watch the Republicans Party bend over for Putin just because Russia helped their party win the election. If anything, Republicans should be outraged and concerned.Trump will now be a puppet who owes Russia favors. Trump has since chosen a close friend of Putin s as Secretary of State and wants to end sanctions against Russia. Trump also expressed his intention to possibly abandon NATO, which would open the door for Russia to be more aggressive toward Europe with no United States to challenge them.The only reason why Republicans are fawning over Russia and Putin is because they would not have won the White House without their assistance. This is a sad time for our country. The political party that once saw Russia as our mortal enemy is now happy to be in Putin s pocket. And that means we can expect more Russian meddling in 2020 unless the GOP and Trump face consequences.Featured image of Donald Trump by Joe Raedle/Getty, image of Vladimir Putin by Thierry Chesnot/Getty",

        "text": "Corey Lewandowski is still beating the Trump drum on CNN, including defending Trump s campaign shakeup this late in the game. There s just one tiny problem   he s doing so by comparing this shakeup to John Kerry s shakeup in 2004 and we all remember how that election turned out.The comments came just after now-former campaign chair Paul Manafort resigned from the campaign, which just strengthened all the talk that Trump is past the point of no return and cannot win this election no matter what he does. Lewandowski tried to counter that by saying: This campaign is not the first campaign to make staff changes. If you look at John Kerry s campaign, when he was running, he was making changes as late as Labor Day, and don t forget we re still in August  No, I understand, but the change in 2004 that John Kerry made helped him actually do significantly better than what he was doing. So? Kerry still lost. There is no getting around that fact. Kerry lost by about 3 million votes and 35 electoral votes. Yes, it was a close election, but really? He still lost and we still got four more years of George W. Bush. It s hard to imagine that anybody of Lewandowski s age and background doesn t see that.This is the kind of ignorance that s pervading Trump s campaign. Things have gotten so pathetically bad that there are people saying the polls don t matter because his social media followings are huge and attendance at his rallies is huge. Tens of millions don t attend his rallies, and it should be patently obvious that his social media following is very heavily biased.Lewandowski is a perfect Trump proxy with his head full of cotton. The main difference between him and those currently on Trump s staff is that the cotton filling their heads is a little more coarse.

It seems that just the sight of the two men holding hands in public was too much for the Neo-Nazis to bear, so the couple decided to give them even more to complain about.David Fernandez and Gregor Eistert were simply out and about like any other couple, having a good time and minding their own business, but their very existence sparked a firestorm of hate from the group. Their actions were brave beyond belief, as we all know how violent hate group members can be. Fernandez says of the encounter: I was filled with rage when I heard what they said. So, I took Gregor and began to kiss him. It was great. I then remember hearing screams and insults about being gay. Unfortunately, it seems that the local police were more concerned with the delicate sensibilities of hate group members than they were with the safety of these two men, though, because they asked them to stop kissing, which is nothing short of shameful.Still, though, good on David and Gregor.

        "text": " 21st Century Wire says According to reports from Business Insider, the Canadian government s immigration website crashed tonight following reports that Donald Trump was pulling ahead in the US after calling a victory in traditional Democrat stronghold of Wisconsin.Clinton surrogate Miley Cyrus.A number of high profile US liberals had said previously that they would  leave the country  if Trump won the presidency, including actor Bryan Cranston and controversial pop singer Miley Cyrus (photo, left), both of who are staunch Hillary Clinton supporters. The barrage of celebrity Clinton campaigners threatening to leave the US helped to propel this talking point nationwide and seems to fall neatly into line with the Clinton campaign s negative fear-based campaign strategy.According to online searches, the Canadian site went down just after 10:30 pm ET on Tuesday evening followed by a surge in traffic, presumably for information on emigrating north of the border.Other key states have shocked pollsters and media  experts  in this election including strong Trump performances in Michigan, Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona.Stay up to date with all the results on the Business Insider live-blog here SEE ALSO: How to move to Canada and become a Canadian citizenREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",

        "title": " Satanists Brilliantly Troll Anti-Gay Baker By Requesting A Birthday Cake For Lucifer (VIDEO)",
        "text": "Christian cake baker Jack Phillips gained national infamy when he violated Colorado s non-discrimination law by refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple s wedding. He was subsequently sued, and now his case is headed to the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, with the current makeup of the court and Donald Trump s administration in place, it is quite likely that discrimination will be codified into law. Nonetheless, The Satanic Temple has come up with a brilliant way to point out that religious freedom cuts both ways: By having these bigoted bakers make cakes for Satan.Jack Phillips has already had his first request via email from a Satanist seeking to celebrate Satan. It reads:Dear Mr PhillipsI would like to get a quote on a birthday cake, for a special event. It is a cake that is religious in theme, and since religion is a protected class, I am hoping that you will gladly bake this cake. As you see the birthday cake in question is to celebrate the birthday of Lucifer, or as they are also known Satan who was born as Satan when he was cast from heaven by God. The cake only needs to be a simple 9 13 single layer cake, with red and black icing. As well as to contain an upside down cross, under the head of Lucifer. And I thought I would seek you out, to bake this cake since you appear to be a very moral person since you refused to bake a cake for same sex couples. And since religion is a protected class, I hope you will be willing to bake this cake, so my small group of religious friends can celebrate the birthday of Lucifer this coming November, just a few days after Halloween.Sincerely,(Name redacted)Here is a sample cake posted to Twitter by The Satanic Temple s co-founder, Lucien Greaves:Did you know: bakers can't refuse service to The Satanic Temple because religion is a \"protected class\"? #SatanCakes pic.twitter.com/9VrVndkbSi  Lucien Greaves (@LucienGreaves) September 26, 2017The whole point here is not to torment bakers or anyone else. It is to point out that if you own a business that is open to the public, you may not discriminate, period. Now, at the federal level there are no non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. However, religion   EVERY religion   is a protected class. If Jack Phillips or anyone else refuses the Satanists their cakes, this will be an open and shut court case.Mr. Phillips, it would have been a hell of a lot easier if you had just baked the damn wedding cake.Here is video of the Temple s co-founder explaining his position:Featured image via video screen capture",

        "text": "Former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, who molested children, received some support from his fellow Republicans as they submitted letters asking for leniency for Hastert after a recent conviction.Dennis Hastert s legal team filed dozens of letters in federal court in Chicago on Friday from individuals expressing support for the former House speaker in preparation for his sentencing on Wednesday.Rep. Tom DeLay, the former House majority whip who helped position Hastert for his role as speaker, wrote that he is a man of  strong faith  and  great integrity. Hastert pleaded guilty of setting up payments of at least $900,000 in order to silence a high school student he sexually abused while he worked as a wrestling coach in suburban Illinois. Two more students also allege that Hastert abused them, and the sister of a deceased student says Hastert abused her sibling as well.Hastert, a conservative Republican, served as Speaker of the House from 1999 to 2007. During that time he was part of the movement to impeach President Bill Clinton over an extramarital affair. Hastert had already committed his offenses by then.Former Majority Leader Tom DeLay, who was often the true muscle at Hastert s side during his time as second in line to the presidency, was not the only Republican who submitted letters asking for leniency for Hastert, due to his age and health problems.In addition to DeLay and members of Hastert s family, Hastert s former GOP colleagues Reps. Thomas Ewing, David Dreier, Porter Goss and John Doolittle also submitted letters of support. The letters were initially submitted under seal, but Durkin said they had to be filed publicly in order to be considered at Hastert s sentencing.In 2015, former Hastert student Steve Reinboldt s sister Jolene gave an interview to ABC News. She told them that her brother confessed to her that his first sexual experience was with Dennis Hastert, and that he never told anyone because he was afraid nobody would believe him. Her brother told her that Hastert abused him for all four years of high school because he served as equipment manager for the wrestling team and had easy access to him.During his time as Speaker of the House, Hastert reportedly worked with other Republicans to cover-up allegations that Rep. Mark Foley had engaged in inappropriate relationships with young Congressional pages.Featured image via Wikimedia",

        "text": "Shawn Helton   21st Century WireWith the United States in the heat of the 2016 presidential election cycle, key questions surrounding the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia continue to persist  as there s a new conspiratorial twist added to an already suspicious case.Recently, here at 21WIRE, we discussed many of the strange circumstances observed in the aftermath of Justice Scalia s death. The 79-year-old conservative justice was found dead in his hotel room at Cibolo Creek Ranch, a luxury ranch located in Presidio County, Texas.There was no official autopsy made by a medical examiner in Scalia s death, only a controversial pronouncement over the phone by Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara.As 21WIRE pointed out in an earlier report regarding Scalia, Guevara appears to have reversed her previous statement claiming that Scalia had died of a  heart attack , revising the cause of death to  natural causes.  Guevara s handling of the death scene of a Supreme Court Justice without being present has drawn sharp criticism from both the media and the public.  ORIGINAL MEANING  Controversial conservative firebrand, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. (Photo illustration 21WIRE)Secret Order, Secret Death?On February 24th, The Washington Post published an article entitled  Justice Scalia spent his last hours with members of this secretive society of elite hunters : When Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died 12 days ago at a West Texas ranch, he was among high-ranking members of an exclusive fraternity for hunters called the International Order of St. Hubertus, an Austrian society that dates back to the 1600s. Continuing, The Washington Post confirmed that indeed, the FBI will not be conducting an investigation into Supreme Court Justice Scalia s death. On an interesting note however, the article states that the FBI was unaware of the secretive international order all together: Law enforcement officials told The Post that they had no knowledge of the International Order of St. Hubertus or its connection to Poindexter and ranch guests. The officials said the FBI had declined to investigate Scalia s death when they were told by the marshals that he died from natural causes.   CLOAK & DAGGER    Members of The International Order of Saint Hubertus, from left: John Kotts, Boysie Bollinger, Vidal Martinez, Reed Morian and John Poindexter. (Photo link chron)The Washington Post article also revealed the identity of Scalia s travel partners:  C. Allen Foster, a prominent Washington lawyer who traveled to the ranch with Scalia by private plane,  and that Cibolo Creek Ranch owner John Poindexter, along with C. Allen Foster, had flown with Scalia to the ranch for the now infamous quail-hunting trip.Also according to the Post, both Poindexter and Foster,  hold leadership positions within the [Saint Hubertus] Order. It is unclear what, if any, official association Scalia had with the group. While the Post acknowledged that many of the 35 guests in attendance at Cibolo Creek Ranch have remained largely unknown to the public eye, they discuss some of the details surrounding the St. Hubertus order, an international brotherhood whose founding member, Count Franz Anton von Sporck , also started a branch of Freemasonry in Bohemia (now the Czech Republic): Members of the worldwide, male-only society wear dark-green robes emblazoned with a large cross and the motto  Deum Diligite Animalia Diligentes,  which means  Honoring God by honoring His creatures,  according to the group s website. The conspiratorial coincidence doesn t end there, it was also revealed that  The society s [Saint Hubertus] U.S. chapter launched in 1966 at the famous Bohemian Club in San Francisco.   CIBOLO CONSPIRACY    What really happened to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. (Photo link twitter)Magic Bullets Become  Magic Pillows Another bizarre element to this story, was the description and discovery of Scalia s body when it was first found by Cibolo Creek ranch owner, Poindexter. This aspect of the story is illustrated very clearly in a passage from the blog Followship of the Minds: On February 14, 2016, in an article for mySA (MySanAntonio) titled,  Texas Ranch owner recalls Scalia s last hours, reporter John MacCormack quoted Poindexter: We discovered the judge in bed, a pillow over his head.Everything was in perfect order. He was in his pajamas, peacefully, in bed. His bed clothes were unwrinkled. He was lying very restfully. It looked like he had not quite awakened from a nap. On February 17, Poindexter  clarified  his comment to the New York Daily News that  There was a pillow over his head, not over his face. The face was entirely clear. And now, the latest.David Warren reports for the AP that according to a Presidio County Sheriff s Office incident report obtained by The Washington Post on Feb. 23, nothing appeared out of place around Scalia s bed. Three pillows were stacked to elevate Scalia s head. A top pillow appeared to have toppled onto his eyes and forehead but didn t appear positioned to impede his breathing.  Scalia s  arms were at his side atop the bed covers, which were pulled up to his chin. The bed covers were smooth and creased and showed no sign of a struggle. That is one magic pillow!First, it was over Scalia s head.Then, it was above Scalia s head, whose face was  entirely clear .Now, the pillow is neither over nor above Scalia s head, but partially covering his face ( toppled onto his eyes and forehead ), although the pillow made sure to position itself so as not to  impede his breathing .   SECRETS IN CIBOLO    The scenic surroundings of Cibolo Creek Ranch. (Photo link tripadvisor)While you have to wonder about the confusion surrounding Scalia s pillow placement, The Washington Post s recent eye-opening revelations regarding the Order of St. Hubertus   give us some other things to consider Silencing Conspiracy with ConspiracyThe overtly conspiracy-tinged Post piece is a rarity in the mainstream world, one that conjure s many Hollywood or government tales of murder, deception and intrigue throughout history.The acknowledgement of a decadent Eyes Wide Shut-like  secret society  on location at Cibolo Creek Ranch prior to Scalia s death, only enhances the drive by voyeurism witnessed since his passing and in a way, it could undermine any legitimate investigation into his death after the fact.While its true, this compelling new detail will most likely bring its lion s share of political protest, as well as predictable calls for congressional inquiry or a push for a federal investigation (as should be)   the heavily publicized presence of a secretive fraternal order of hunters nearby a suspicious crime scene, will unfortunately fuel more speculation.Put another way: Whether or not the secret group at Cibolo Creek Ranch was involved in Scalia s death, you have to wonder why the mainstream media revealed this latest conspiratorial element in the first place.Media gatekeepers in television, print and radio will have a field day with this new controversial piece, all the while pushing and pulling the population into a particular corner   and by the looks of it, that s already happening.Having said all of this however, there s still much to be concerned with regarding Scalia s highly suspicious death   OBAMA NO-SHOW    The funeral service for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Oddly, President Obama elected not to attend. (Photo link detroitnewstime)Big Questions RemainOver the years, Scalia s various political connections and political perspective on important issues earned him a controversial reputation.In 2014, Justice Scalia drew harsh criticism for his views on the CIA torture debate, when the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee released a report on the interrogation techniques used since the 9/11 attacks.Whether you agreed or disagreed with Scalia, it s important to note once again that the high court has several pending landmark cases on climate, abortion and immigration, all within weeks or months of his death.The NY Post s recent article entitled  Scalia could have been poisoned: forensic pathologist, raised even more questions about the state of Scalia s body upon being discovered: Lethal poisoning could have left Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s body in virtually the same condition in which it was found, a top forensic pathologist [Dr. Michael Baden] told The Post on Wednesday. For the time being, were left to wonder what other secrets lie in Cibolo Creek Ranch regarding the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",

        "text": "On Friday, a jury did something that will certainly anger Donald Trump s hamburger delivery boy, Chris Christie   handed down a decision against two of his top staffers in the Bridgegate case.Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie s former deupty chief-of-staff, and former senior official at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Bill Baroni, found themselves facing nine counts of conspiracy and wire fraud for their roles in orchetrating a 2013 bridge closure as an attack against one of Christie s political enemies. The two were indicted Friday after David Wildstein   another former Port Authority executive and the mastermind of the plan   named them as he pleaded guilty to his role in the lane closures.The most serious charges in the indictment could land the two behind bars for up to 20 years according to the U.S. Attorney s office. Wildstein says his intent was to  punish  Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for failing to endorse Christie for President. Public officials must use government resources for proper government purposes,  U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said of the indictments.  The indictment alleges, and Wildstein admitted, that the three defendants used Port Authority resources to exact political retribution against a public official who would not endorse the Governor for re-election, and concocted and promoted a bogus cover story to execute their plan and to cover their tracks. Attorneys for both Kelly and Baroni call Wildstein a  liar,  despite his confession, and promise that they will clear their names. The charges they face include conspiracy against civil rights, deprivation of civil rights, wire fraud, conspiring to  intentionally misapply property of an organization receiving federal benefits  and others. They are scheduled to be arraigned on Monday   the day before we decide if Christie s friend Trump or Hillary Clinton will become the next President.Read the court documents below:Featured image via Getty Images (Justin Sullivan)",

        "text": "Montel Williams, who has been fighting Multiple Sclerosis since 1999, ripped the GOP s hideous health care bill, and the Republicans who voted for it, to pieces.The American Health Care Act guts the protections for pre-existing conditions that Obamacare had provided. Under the AHCA, states could opt out of federal regulations and allow insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions as much as they want. This means that sick people, the very people who need medical care the most, could find themselves priced out of insurance coverage.Williams, who has been a vocal advocate for MS, weighed in on the bill during an interview with CNN on Saturday. When by asked by Ana Cabrera what he thought of the AHCA, Williams did not hold back.What people at home don t understand, when you say terms and things like pre-existing conditions, they really are basing this on what an insurance company has stated was a pre-existing condition.So, they think about 22 percent of Americans have a problem right this minute. This is from the National Institutes of Health. Over 56 percent of adult Americans, 120 million adult Americans, have one chronic illness. And around 80 percent of them have at least two.So these numbers that people throw out are so wrong.Cabrera pointed out that Republicans have promised  access  to health care, but what they really mean is that you can get insurance coverage if you are rich enough to pay for it. Williams said that he is lucky to be able to afford whatever health insurance he needs, but most Americans don t have that luxury.He went on to say that many MS patients are already unable to get the medications they need to control this debilitating neurological condition because they don t have insurance. Williams explained that the medication he himself is on costs over $1,500 a month. I also have MS, and the price tag for just one of my medications tops $100,000 a year.Williams says that we need to worry about lowering costs, not signing people s death warrants with heinous bills like the AHCA. He explains that the  normal American  can t afford to pay these kinds of prices for the medicines  that keep them alive. That s what insurance is for,  he added.Watch Montel tear the GOP health care bill to pieces, here:Featured image via video screen capture",

        "text": "Only days after the worst mass shooting in the nation s history happened against the LGBT community, the GOP decided they could go back to being discriminatory.One would think they d wait at least a week, but apparently three days seemed long enough to mourn the loss of those who perished at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, because according to Vanity Fair:Republican leaders in the House of Representatives blocked a vote on a proposal that would ensure federal contractors can t discriminate against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identification.That s right, you read that correctly, they seem to think it s perfectly acceptable for federal contractors to be able to fire someone for being gay.According to The Hill:Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), who is gay, filed an amendment to a Defense Department spending bill that would enforce a 2014 executive order prohibiting discrimination against LGBT people.Yet, the House Rules Committee didn t see it worthy of consideration and wouldn t even allow it to be voted upon. Nope, not even a vote. Not even a chance.Apparently, the House GOP doesn t want anything added to the annual spending bills for fear that it may inhibit passage. You know, because adding non-discriminatory amendments for LGBT people in a House of Representatives full of GOP bigots doesn t go over well and could clog up business as usual.As The Hill explains:House GOP leaders decided to clamp down on amendments to annual spending bills after Maloney s proposal threatened passage of other appropriations measures last month. Before now, Republicans had been considering appropriations bills under a procedure allowing members of either party to offer unlimited amendments.Don t you see, they only want to play by their rules. If you re not doing something they like, well, then they will make sure it never happens, but guaranteed if it was the other way around, the story would be verrrry different.This just proves, yet again, that Republicans only care about themselves.Featured Photo by Allison Shelley/Getty Images",

        "text": " She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer. She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality. I ve decided to reprint a piece of work I did nearly five years ago, because it seems very relevant today given Hillary Clinton s performance in the Benghazi hearings. Back in 2008 when she was running for president, I interviewed two erstwhile staff members of the House Judiciary Committee who were involved with the atergate investigation when Hillary was a low-level staffer there. I interviewed one Democrat staffer and one Republican staffer, and wrote two pieces based on what they told me about Hillary s conduct at the time.I published these pieces back in 2008 for North Star Writers Group, the syndicate I ran at the time. This was the most widely read piece we ever had at NSWG, but because NSWG never gained the high-profile status of the major syndicates, this piece still didn t reach as many people as I thought it deserved to. Today, given the much broader reach of CainTV and yet another incidence of Hillary s arrogance in dealing with a congressional committee, I think it deserves another airing. For the purposes of simplicity, I ve combined the two pieces into one very long one. If you re interested in understanding the true character of Hillary Clinton, it s worth your time to read it.As Hillary Clinton came under increasing scrutiny for her story about facing sniper fire in Bosnia, one question that arose was whether she has engaged in a pattern of lying.The now-retired general counsel and chief of staff of the House Judiciary Committee, who supervised Hillary when she worked on the Watergate investigation, says Hillary s history of lies and unethical behavior goes back farther   and goes much deeper   than anyone realizes.Jerry Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, supervised the work of 27-year-old Hillary Rodham on the committee. Hillary got a job working on the investigation at the behest of her former law professor, Burke Marshall, who was also Sen. Ted Kennedy s chief counsel in the Chappaquiddick affair. When the investigation was over, Zeifman fired Hillary from the committee staff and refused to give her a letter of recommendation   one of only three people who earned that dubious distinction in Zeifman s 17-year career.Why? Because she was a liar,  Zeifman said in an interview last week.  She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer. She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality. How could a 27-year-old House staff member do all that? She couldn t do it by herself, but Zeifman said she was one of several individuals   including Marshall, special counsel John Doar and senior associate special counsel (and future Clinton White House Counsel) Bernard Nussbaum   who engaged in a seemingly implausible scheme to deny Richard Nixon the right to counsel during the investigatioWhy would they want to do that? Because, according to Zeifman, they feared putting Watergate break-in mastermind E. Howard Hunt on the stand to be cross-examined by counsel to the president. Hunt, Zeifman said, had the goods on nefarious activities in the Kennedy Administration that would have made Watergate look like a day at the beach   including Kennedy s purported complicity in the attempted assassination of Fidel Castro.The actions of Hillary and her cohorts went directly against the judgment of top Democrats, up to and including then-House Majority Leader Tip O Neill, that Nixon clearly had the right to counsel. Zeifman says that Hillary, along with Marshall, Nussbaum and Doar, was determined to gain enough votes on the Judiciary Committee to change House rules and deny counsel to Nixon. And in order to pull this off, Zeifman says Hillary wrote a fraudulent legal brief, and confiscated public documents to hide her deception.The brief involved precedent for representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding. When Hillary endeavored to write a legal brief arguing there is no right to representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding, Zeifman says, he told Hillary about the case of Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, who faced an impeachment attempt in 1970. As soon as the impeachment resolutions were introduced by (then-House Minority Leader Gerald) Ford, and they were referred to the House Judiciary Committee, the first thing Douglas did was hire himself a lawyer,  Zeifman said.The Judiciary Committee allowed Douglas to keep counsel, thus establishing the precedent. Zeifman says he told Hillary that all the documents establishing this fact were in the Judiciary Committee s public files. So what did Hillary do? Hillary then removed all the Douglas files to the offices where she was located, which at that time was secured and inaccessible to the public,  Zeifman said. Hillary then proceeded to write a legal brief arguing there was no precedent for the right to representation by counsel during an impeachment proceeding   as if the Douglas case had never occurred.The brief was so fraudulent and ridiculous, Zeifman believes Hillary would have been disbarred if she had submitted it to a judge.Zeifman says that if Hillary, Marshall, Nussbaum and Doar had succeeded, members of the House Judiciary Committee would have also been denied the right to cross-examine witnesses, and denied the opportunity to even participate in the drafting of articles of impeachment against Nixon.Of course, Nixon s resignation rendered the entire issue moot, ending Hillary s career on the Judiciary Committee staff in a most undistinguished manner. Zeifman says he was urged by top committee members to keep a diary of everything that was happening. He did so, and still has the diary if anyone wants to check the veracity of his story. Certainly, he could not have known in 1974 that diary entries about a young lawyer named Hillary Rodham would be of interest to anyone 34 years later.But they show that the pattern of lies, deceit, fabrications and unethical behavior was established long ago   long before the Bosnia lie, and indeed, even before cattle futures, Travelgate and Whitewater   for the woman who is still asking us to make her president of the United States.Franklin Polk, who served at the time as chief Republican counsel on the committee, confirmed many of these details in two interviews he granted me this past Friday, although his analysis of events is not always identical to Zeifman s. Polk specifically confirmed that Hillary wrote the memo in question, and confirmed that Hillary ignored the Douglas case. (He said he couldn t confirm or dispel the part about Hillary taking the Douglas files.)To Polk, Hillary s memo was dishonest in the sense that she tried to pretend the Douglas precedent didn t exist. But unlike Zeifman, Polk considered the memo dishonest in a way that was more stupid than sinister. Hillary should have mentioned that (the Douglas case), and then tried to argue whether that was a change of policy or not instead of just ignoring it and taking the precedent out of the opinion,  Polk said.Polk recalled that the attempt to deny counsel to Nixon upset a great many members of the committee, including just about all the Republicans, but many Democrats as well. The argument sort of broke like a firestorm on the committee, and I remember Congressman Don Edwards was very upset,  Polk said.  He was the chairman of the subcommittee on constitutional rights. But in truth, the impeachment precedents are not clear. Let s put it this way. In the old days, from the beginning of the country through the 1800s and early 1900s, there were precedents that the target or accused did not have the right to counsel. That s why Polk believes Hillary s approach in writing the memorandum was foolish. He says she could have argued that the Douglas case was an isolated example, and that other historical precedents could apply.But Zeifman says the memo and removal of the Douglas files was only part the effort by Hillary, Doar, Nussbaum and Marshall to pursue their own agenda during the investigation.After my first column, some readers wrote in claiming Zeifman was motivated by jealousy because he was not appointed as the chief counsel in the investigation, with that title going to Doar instead.Zeifman s account is that he supported the appointment of Doar because he, Zeifman, a) did not want the public notoriety that would come with such a high-profile role; and b) didn t have much prosecutorial experience. When he started to have a problem with Doar and his allies was when Zeifman and others, including House Majority Leader Tip O Neill and Democratic committee member Jack Brooks of Texas, began to perceive Doar s group as acting outside the directives and knowledge of the committee and its chairman, Peter Rodino.(O Neill died in 1994. Brooks is still living and I tried unsuccessfully to reach him. I d still like to.)This culminated in a project to research past presidential abuses of power, which committee members felt was crucial in aiding the decisions they would make in deciding how to handle Nixon s alleged offenses.According to Zeifman and other documents, Doar directed Hillary to work with a group of Yale law professors on this project. But the report they generated was never given to the committee. Zeifman believes the reason was that the report was little more than a whitewash of the Kennedy years   a part of the Burke Marshall-led agenda of avoiding revelations during the Watergate investigation that would have embarrassed the Kennedys.The fact that the report was kept under wraps upset Republican committee member Charles Wiggins of California, who wrote a memo to his colleagues on the committee that read in part:Within the past few days, some disturbing information has come to my attention. It is requested that the facts concerning the matter be investigated and a report be made to the full committee as it concerns us all.Early last spring when it became obvious that the committee was considering presidential  abuse of power  as a possible ground of impeachment, I raised the question before the full committee that research should be undertaken so as to furnish a standard against which to test the alleged abusive conduct of Richard Nixon.As I recall, several other members joined with me in this request. I recall as well repeating this request from time to time during the course of our investigation. The staff, as I recall, was noncommittal, but it is certain that no such staff study was made available to the members at any time for their use.Wiggins believed the report was purposely hidden from committee members. Chairman Rodino denied this, and said the reason Hillary s report was not given to committee members was that it contained no value. It s worth noting, of course, that the staff member who made this judgment was John Doar.In a four-page reply to Wiggins, Rodino wrote in part:Hillary Rodham of the impeachment inquiry staff coordinated the work. . . . After the staff received the report it was reviewed by Ms. Rodham, briefly by Mr. Labovitz and Mr. Sack, and by Doar. The staff did not think the manuscript was useful in its present form. . . .In your letter you suggest that members of the staff may have intentionally suppressed the report during the course of its investigation. That was not the case.As a matter of fact, Mr. Doar was more concerned that any highlight of the project might prejudice the case against President Nixon. The fact is that the staff did not think the material was usable by the committee in its existing form and had not had time to modify it so it would have practical utility for the members of the committee. I was informed and agreed with the judgment.Mr. Labovitz, by the way, was John Labovitz, another member of the Democratic staff. I spoke with Labovitz this past Friday as well, and he is no fan of Jerry Zeifman. If it s according to Zeifman, it s inaccurate from my perspective,  Labovitz said. He bases that statement on a recollection that Zeifman did not actually work on the impeachment inquiry staff, although that is contradicted not only by Zeifman but Polk as well.Labovitz said he has no knowledge of Hillary having taken any files, and defended her no-right-to-counsel memo on the grounds that, if she was assigned to write a memo arguing a point of view, she was merely following orders.But as both Zeifman and Polk point out, that doesn t mean ignoring background of which you are aware, or worse, as Zeifman alleges, confiscating documents that disprove your argument.All told, Polk recalls the actions of Hillary, Doar and Nussbaum as more amateurish than anything else. Of course the Republicans went nuts,  Polk said.  But so did some of the Democrats   some of the most liberal Democrats. It was more like these guys   Doar and company   were trying to manage the members of Congress, and it was like,  Who s in charge here?  If you want to convict a president, you want to give him all the rights possible. If you re going to give him a trial, for him to say,  My rights were denied,    it was a stupid effort by people who were just politically tone deaf. So this was a big deal to people in the proceedings on the committee, no question about it. And Jerry Zeifman went nuts, and rightfully so. But my reaction wasn t so much that it was underhanded as it was just stupid. Polk recalls Zeifman sharing with him at the time that he believed Hillary s primary role was to report back to Burke Marshall any time the investigation was taking a turn that was not to the liking of the Kennedys. Jerry used to give the chapter and verse as to how Hillary was the mole into the committee works as to how things were going,  Polk said.  And she d be feeding information back to Burke Marshall, who, at least according to Jerry, was talking to the Kennedys. And when something was off track in the view of the Kennedys, Burke Marshall would call John Doar or something, and there would be a reconsideration of what they were talking about. Jerry used to tell me that this was Hillary s primary function. Zeifman says he had another staff member get him Hillary s phone records, which showed that she was calling Burke Marshall at least once a day, and often several times a day.A final note about all this: I wrote my first column on this subject because, in the aftermath of Hillary being caught in her Bosnia fib, I came in contact with Jerry Zeifman and found his story compelling. Zeifman has been trying to tell his story for many years, and the mainstream media have ignored him. I thought it deserved an airing as a demonstration of how early in her career Hillary began engaging in self-serving, disingenuous conduct.Disingenuously arguing a position? Vanishing documents? Selling out members of her own party to advance a personal agenda? Classic Hillary. Neither my first column on the subject nor this one were designed to show that Hillary is dishonest. I don t really think that s in dispute. Rather, they were designed to show that she has been this way for a very long time   a fact worth considering for anyone contemplating voting for her for president of the United States.By the way, there s something else that started a long time ago. She would go around saying,  I m dating a person who will some day be president,  Polk said.  It was like a Babe Ruth call. And because of that comment she made, I watched Bill Clinton s political efforts as governor of Arkansas, and I never counted him out because she had made that forecast. Bill knew what he wanted a long time ago. Clearly, so did Hillary, and her tactics for trying to achieve it were established even in those early days.Vote wisely.Via: Patriot Net Daily",

        "text": "Norway has a new immigration sheriff in town, and so far, it appears that she s singing the same tune as President Trump on immigration. And oh yeah, Sylvi Listhaug  doesn t give a damn  about her critics either. How far are bleeding-heart nations, like Sweden, France, the UK, and Germany willing to take this mass-immigration experiment, before they realize it s too late to turn back? Before her appointment to the cabinet on December 16, Listhaug, then agriculture minister, criticized what she called a  tyranny of kindness that is blowing over Norwegian society like a nightmare. It is very serious that politicians are using punitive measures that would make it more difficult for a number of asylum seekers who are entitled to protection,  asylum association spokesman Andreas Furuseth told the Norwegian news agency NTB.Listhaug said she wanted 40 or so major and minor asylum law changes submitted to parliament in February before the European spring season, when asylum seeker arrivals were expected to rise again.She told Norwegian NRK public television that her legislative package amounted to a  sharp retrenchment  on wide social entitlements previously granted to refugees.Some 35,000 asylum seekers arrived in Norway in 2015.It was a record for the oil and gas-rich Nordic nation of 5.2 million people, which in recent weeks saw fewer arrivals, in part because of border controls reintroduced in neighboring Sweden and the arrival of wintry weather.NRK said the proposed rule tightening would allow family reunifications only after the applicant had acquired four years of work or education in Norway.And, the government would issue voucher cards instead of cash for day-to-day items to prevent applicants from sending money to family back home.Migrants who arrived on transit visas via Russia would not be granted asylum.Older applicants in the 55 to 67 age group would be required to learn the Norwegian language and aspects of Norwegian society.Applicants who fail to present identity documents will be refused asylum. A grant of temporary residence would not automatically lead to permanent residence.  DWWhen Angela Merkel invited refugees to Germany in 2015, tearing up the rules obliging migrants to seek asylum in the first country they arrive in, the consequences were pretty immediate. Over 160,000 went to Sweden, leading to well-publicised disruption. Next door, things were different. Norway took in just 30,000; this year it has accepted just 2,000 so far. To Sylvi Listhaug, the country s young immigration minister, this might still be a bit too much. We have a big challenge now to integrate those with permission to stay in Norway to make sure they respect Norwegian values,  she says.  Freedom to speak, to write, to believe or not to believe in a god, how to raise your children.  Also, she says, what not to do. For example:  It is not allowed to beat your children in Norway. It s unusual for a European government minister to link immigration with child-beating, but the 39-year-old Ms Listhaug is accustomed to speaking plainly. The rest of Europe, she believes, is coming around to the Norwegian position.After decades in opposition, her Progress Party entered government four years ago, a junior partner in a Conservative-run coalition. Her party envisaged the problems of mass migration in the 1980s, she says, so was well ahead of the populist upstarts now haunting so much of Europe.  A lot of them are socialist parties but against immigration. We are a libertarian party. We want less government, so people should decide more over their own life. And we want a stricter immigration policy because that s important for Norway in the long run. While Sweden and others saw the migration of 2015 as a blip caused by conflict in Syria and Iraq, she sees it as part of an irreversible demographic trend.  Africa is going to gain almost 500 million more people by 2030,  she says.  Much of the Middle East and Africa is fragile. People have difficult lives but can see via mobile phones that life in the West and in Europe is quite different. So I understand why they would like our life, our kind of standards. But it s not sustainable to integrate so many. Why not? Norway, with its oil-generated trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund, is one of the world s richest countries   and hardly beset by integration issues. This, she says, is because they ve been careful.  Many of the jobs here today perhaps will not be here tomorrow. Working in supermarkets for example   those kinds of jobs that don t need higher education. Those who come to Norway without any education   what are they going to do in the future if this continues? The case for limiting economic migration is clear. But about half of the registered asylum seekers in the EU, last year were from countries that were struck by conflict. Can Norway justify taking so few? Ms. Listhaug is a practicing Christian (albeit skeptical of the  thoroughly socialist  Church of Norway) and says her government s immigration policy, when combined with its aid policy, is not just a moral response, but the most effective moral response. For me it s a moral issue as well. You can t just help the ones you see. You have to think about the millions you don t see and that have a very difficult life in the world. She s referring to the refugee camps in Jordan, where both Norway and the UK send aid to help those displaced by war. Norway gave  23 million to its Jordanian mission last year, almost twice as much, per capita, as Britain. The cost of helping refugees at home is taken from its foreign aid budget, so as its influx subsides and costs fall, all savings are used to help refugees abroad. Some  370 million has been transferred so far, with more expected next year.So to Ms. Listhaug, it s not a question of whether to help refugees, but how best to do so. We meet after she visited Brandon Lewis, her British counterpart, who gave her a striking statistic:  The immigration minister here in Britain said that for the price of helping 3,000 young people here, he could help 100,000 children in other parts of the world. She sees this as a modern way to help asylum seekers   and more practical than the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, which obliges signatories to accommodate anyone with a  well-founded fear of persecution . It was an agreement for its time,  she says.  But when people travel through 20 countries to come to a safe haven, I think people can see that this is not right. You could have a safe haven in your neighboring country, so why go so far? Western countries that define their virtue by the number of refugees they let in, she says, also face a moral question:  Why should we have a system that works for the people who have money [to pay for the journey] while the rest of the refugees and people in need don t have the money to go? People traffickers, she says, thrive on governments that follow the old rules and accept those who turn up on their shores.  If you smuggle an unaccompanied minor from Afghanistan to Europe, they say it is between $3,000 and $20,000.  Young girls, she says, are sometimes sold to old men to finance such a journey.  Also, children are killed, or raped, on their way. So we need to have this under control. Ms Listhaug provoked fury in Sweden a few weeks ago by visiting a suburb in Stockholm notorious for unrest among its young immigrant population. She called it a  no-go zone    a phrase that the Swedes angrily reject. But she doesn t seem to mind causing a fuss, especially as she thinks her critics are coming around to her way of thinking. Nor does she mind using Sweden as a case study in what not to do.  A lot of countries in Europe are thinking more like us: like Denmark and Austria. Germany, as well  France has big problems right now with integration, as does Belgium. A lot of countries in Europe see that we need to have this under control. The Norwegian model, she says, is very different and very clear.  If you are an economic migrant, you are declined in Norway,  she says.  We send people back to Afghanistan if they are not in need of protection; we send them back to Somalia if they are not in need of protection.  Isn t this a rather expensive process?  Yes, but it s well worth it.  Police are also sent out to areas where illegal immigrants are suspected of living and working.  If we find them, we send them out. That has also decreased crime in Norway, that s very good. I ask Listhaug if she is getting used to being called cruel and heartless. How does it make her feel? Her response comes quickly:  I don t give a damn,  she says. She thinks her approach is right, and the consensus is wrong. And, as she says, an increasing number of other countries think the same. A new consensus might well be in the making.  SpectatorUKSo what do her neighbors in Sweden think of her tough positions on asylum seekers? The Swedish resident in the video below has nothing but praise for Listhaug. He openly praises her while mocking the  lefties  who have allowed out-of-control migration to destroy much of Sweden. In the video below, he reminds Swedes of the startling crime statistics they are facing: In Sweden, we have 10 times more car torchings. Do you want this? We have 4 times more violent killings than Norway. Is that what you want? Well, you should listen to your lefties, and be more like Sweden, It s interesting, the migration minister Sylvi Listhaug, came to Sweden to find out for herself, she wanted to find out what not to do in Norway.

Gutierrez was widely ridiculed, and many on social media like Twitter pointed out that in fact they would love to have a taco truck nearby   tacos are one of the most popular food items in the United States, as the ubiquitous Taco Bell chain would indicate.Democrats took the absurd taco truck comment and began using it to make fun of the Trump campaign. In some locations, taco trucks have now been used as part of voter registration drives in order to get new voters to the polls in November.Trump s anti-immigrant campaign, specifically targeted at Latino immigrants, is expected to prompt an increase in voter registration and participation within the Latino community. The fastest growing ethnic demographic in the United States, Latinos were once seen by the Republican Party in the era of George W. Bush as a route to electoral dominance. Since then, the GOP has instead embraced a hard-right nativist stance, opposing immigration reform even when it has strong popular support.By contrast, Democrats have now completely taken up the mantle of being pro-immigrant.Featured image via screen capture",

        "title": " Intelligence Officials SKEWER Trump For Politicizing Classified Briefings",
        "text": "The latest 2016 developments are completely unprecedented in our nation s history but Donald Trump doesn t care.Despite the fact that classified intelligence briefings are supposed to be kept confidential and neutral during elections, the Republican nominee broke established protocol on Wednesday night and opened his big mouth to make unfounded claims about those meetings.During the Commander-in-Chief Forum on NBC, Trump demonstrated in a single breath that he is totally unfit to be president when he told Matt Lauer that he could tell by the  body language  of those briefing him that don t like President Obama. I was very, very surprised. In almost every instance, and I could tell, I have pretty good with the body language [sic], I could tell, they were not happy. Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending. Not only is Trump trying to destroy the neutrality of the intelligence community, he is trying to use them for his own political gain.And intelligence officials both past and present were quick to slam him for it.Former CIA analyst Paul Pillar told the Washington Post that intelligence officers do not express political preferences during these briefings and they certainly do not use body language. Those selected for this task would have been the most professional of an elite corps of intelligence officers. One of the last things they would do is express either verbally or through body language preferences. Former CIA officer David Priess, who is experienced at delivering briefings was completely disgusting by Trump s claim. We ve had other presidential candidates mention that they got a briefing and talk in platitudes about it. We ve never had somebody talk about what happened in a session. Trump not only blabbed, he told a straight-up lie in order to claim that there is discord between the Obama Administration and the intelligence community, which could create a mistrust that could have serious consequences. In short, this attempt by Trump to score political points is dangerous.Former CIA Director Michael Morell agrees. This is the first time that I can remember a candidate for president doing a readout from an intelligence briefing, and it s the first time a candidate has politicized their intelligence briefing,  he told NBC.  Both of those are highly inappropriate and crossed a long standing red line respected by both parties. To me this is just the most recent example that underscores that this guy is unfit to be commander in chief. Donald Trump is clearly sowing discord between the intelligence community and the current administration at a time when we need both to work together to protect the American people. But that will only get harder because of Trump s unwillingness to keep his mouth shut by making claims he can t prove.Intelligence officials are trained to be neutral and to keep their personal political beliefs out of their assessments. Ultimately, the president has the final say on what action to take on certain intelligence whether intelligence agents agree or not.At this point, Trump has failed to build trust with the intelligence community and that could be a major problem for this country as we seek to prevent future attacks by ISIS. Donald trump is not helping, he is hurting and that is not the kind of president America needs.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",

The MTV awards use to be a fun-filled night of entertainment but now it s a chance for political activism to take center stage. Prior to the show, Beyonce met with the Michael Brown s mom and other moms of people killed by police officers. We guess she forgot about the fact that all of these cases are legitimate cases of crimes being committed by the deceased. The truth is way too buried because it s more profitable for the truth to be twisted. Where were the families of police officers like the Dallas officers murdered in cold blood? Nope, Beyonce had to stick with a lie and be the political activist she always has been. Remember the Super Bowl? Yes, that was where she had her dancers form an X on the field in support of the Black Panthers fist raised in the air and all. I have one thing to say about all of this  While performing a medley of songs from her hit album, Lemonade, the pop megastar was surrounded by backup dancers dressed as angels. However, as red lights flooded the stage, each of the  angels  was shot down during the performance, which viewers said was a representation of police brutality. The imagery of the Beyonce performance with the angels getting shot down ,  one person tweeted.  Beyonce too deep. All the angels were shot, police brutality,  another wrote.I think I need a moment after watching @beyonce s #VMA performance https://t.co/lYVFfrIenO  MTV (@MTV) August 29, 2016  Read more: Daily Mail ",

        "text": "Coming into Tuesday s Republican primary in Indiana it was pretty much do or die for Ted Cruz. He had to win or his campaign for the presidency was effectively over. And boy did he try. He put all he could into trying to win over the Hoosier state, but try as he might, he failed miserably. Donald Trump won with over 50 percent of the vote and Ted Cruz was left with a tough decision to make.By the end of Cruz s speech after his Indiana loss it was pretty damn clear that he was about to suspend his campaign. He spoke in broad, sweeping conservative analogies that had nothing to do with becoming president. And what seemed obvious became reality when he told everyone that he was pulling out of the race.One person, however, saw the delicious irony in Cruz quitting early, and that person was Full Frontal s Samantha Bee. She took to Twitter to tell Cruz what he should have done with his campaign.Bee wrote: Shouldn t Ted Cruz have been forced to carry his unviable campaign to term? Shouldn't #TedCruz have been forced to carry his unviable campaign to term?  Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) May 4, 2016Of course, this being a play on Cruz s ridiculous stance on abortion rights. The man claims he stands up for women, but apparently that means loving women so much that he s the person to make all of their health decisions. He s also been one of the key reasons the Planned Parenthood myth of baby body parts has gone on for so long.Ted Cruz is a liar and a smarmy salesman that just couldn t figure out how to sell himself to the American voting public. He was so bad, in fact, that he couldn t even make himself look good next to Donald Trump.Bee also tweeted:At least the #TedCruz campaign died as it lived under Trump's heel while Republicans looked on with indifference.

        "text": "Anila Ali was born in Karachi, Pakistan, and studied in London, where she became a volunteer in the All Pakistan Women s Association. In 1996, she came to California. She is an active member of the Council of Pakistan-American Affairs (COPAA), the author of  Mommy am I a ?  and a contributor to the largest Pakistani paper in the U.S., The Pakistan Link.Ali is the founder and board member of the American Muslim Women s Empowerment Council, which is the only Muslim women s organization that works on the ground with law enforcement and interfaith leaders to counter radicalization and build capacity in the Muslim community do they can be the first line of defense against radicalization.She graciously agreed to speak with Clarion Project Dialogue Coordinator Elliot Friedland about being a Muslim-American since the election. The views expressed herein are the author s own and do not necessarily reflect the view of Clarion Project. Ryan Mauro previously interviewed Anila Ali for Clarion Project.1. Clarion Project: Since Trump s election many Muslim groups are feeling scared that he will implement repressive policies targeted at the Muslim community. How do you feel about such fears?Anila Ali: There is a real fear in the community that a Trump presidency will mean restrictions on Muslims. There is talk of internment camps and it was in registry and that is generating a lot of misconceptions and fears. There is also a concern that Mosques and citizens will be monitored as well.Personally, I have faith in the constitution of the United States of America and I feel majority of America knows and understands that you cannot make generalized statements about all Muslims and paint all Muslims with the same brush stroke.But we have also realize that it is time that Muslims in America step up their game and get more involved in making sure that the neighbors understand who they are and that they are peace-loving patriotic Americans.For it is mostly the fear of the unknown that spreads misconceptions.2. Clarion: What should public figures be doing to calm inter-communal relations?Ali: Public figures, especially the ones in the majority party, have a responsibility to represent all Americans. Their words can help alleviate fears about Muslims and stop the Muslims from getting marginalized. Show of support unity with all unities that maybe feeling slightly marginalized, will help them from further isolation.The level of hateful rhetoric that I have heard in the past one month has been the worst since 911. It seems people have a newfound courage to tell  Muslims to leave the country,   pack up and leave the country  etc. Anti-Muslim sentiment is rampant and most people are not able to distinguish between a radical and a moderate.There is a general perception that all Muslims condone violence and that all Muslims want sharia law in America. There is also a very toxic perception that Muslims like myself who are any patriotic, modern and progressive are lying as mandated in the Quran to convert people, the concept being taqqiya. This notion must be dispelled because the majority of Muslims don t even know what this concept is. Muslims who have come from South Asia have no idea of this Arabic concept because it is part of the Wahhabi Salafist ideology and Muslims like me, majority coming from South Asia, have never even heard of it.These misconceptions in the mainstream community must be countered and dispelled.3. Clarion: What do you think the impact of designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization would be if it passed?Ali: If Arab countries can ban Muslim brotherhood why can t we? Any organization that has terrorist ties should be banned in the US. Any organization that condone the killing of an innocent, or promote so insights hatred for non-Muslims should be banned.4. Clarion: What organizations or activists would you recommend as standing up for the rights of the community and are unaffiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood or related organizations?Ali: Of course I would promote my own organization American Muslim women s empowerment Council, formed to counter extremism which gives women a voice, promotes the real Islam, gives women equality and completely condemns all shapes and forms of terrorism and hatred.Whoever wants to follow sharia law should migrate to a Muslim country like Saudi Arabia.For entire interview, go to the Clarion Project",

I had a lengthy phone conversation with him last year and after I hung up the phone, I had the same kind of feeling I had after meeting Andrew Breitbart. Like Andrew Breitbart, Sabo s not fighting a conventional war against the left, he s studied them, he knows the dirty tactics they use to win and he s determined to beat them at their own game, even if it means shocking a few Americans along the way. Sabo never got to meet Andrew Breitbart, but always wanted to, as he recalls here:Now a thing about me was I d spent a good three years trying to get sober. In that time I did everything I could to stay the hell away from politics. It was the most peaceful three years of my life. Unfortunately during those three years guys like Glenn Beck and Andrew Breitbart were really picking up steam. So, because of my absence from the political scene I didn t really know much about them. And what little I did know about Glenn Beck I didn t really like. I remember friends would try turning me on to him but I wasn t into his delivery, too loud, too passionate. Not my deal. Sadly Andrew passed away about the time I decided to get back into the political fray. I never had the privilege to meet him. Everyone says we d of really gotten along. I did however get to meet his crew and they were all stand up people.Glenn Beck interviewed Sabo in 2015 when he was still keeping his face hidden from the public:  One of Sabo s most popular pieces of work was his badass representation of Ted Cruz who he wholeheartedly supported for President.During the campaign, Sabo came after Hillary and Bernie Sanders pretty hard. He focused on plastering his hard-hitting posters in areas where fundraisers or events for Bernie or Hillary were taking place. Sabo wanted to make sure the American public saw Hillary as he saw Hillary:It took him a while to come around to Donald Trump, but eventually he did.Sabo s controversial artwork can be found on posters, t-shirts and bumper stickers at his online store: unsavoryagents.com Here s a video of Sabo replacing a sign in a park bench in LA with his own unique printed message. Notice the guy smoking a crack pipe on the bench the entire time.In 2014, Sabo got a little visit from the Secret Service over his  controversial  posts on Twitter. He certainly didn t handle the interview in the way most Americans would have.:Sabo will be on FOX News  Tucker Carlson show tonight at 9 pm EST. He ll likely discuss the artwork that he plastered all over LA in advance of the Oscars last night.Here are a few of the posters liberal actors found when they arrived on the red carpet.

        "text": "Right-wing pundits on Fox and Friends this week went on a little tirade about the rules of Twitter and how unfair they are to conservatives. Host Clayton Morris joined National Review writer Katherine Timf in shredding Twitter s  Abusive Behavior Policy,  designed to keep people from bullying others on the internet. The problem the conservatives have with the rule isn t that you could be suspended or banned from Twitter for a few malicious reports   it s that there isn t enough distinction between them and ISIS terrorists.Yes, really. Conservatives are concerned that because the policy doesn t specifically mention ISIS that a bunch of other extremist loudmouths with violent agendas and histories may be targeted and removed from Twitter. They don t argue the point at all from the perspective that there s no reason to compare right-wing American  patriots  to terrorists because to suggest such a thing would be as ludicrous as any claim ever made about anything. Ever.Right-wingers are brash, crass, low-information degenerates. Occasionally you come across a right-winger with an intelligence level worthy of a game of Connect Four, but nothing you d consider the upper middle class to wealthy American they vote to please. They are led by their puppet masters on missions to free the world from the tyrannical rule of Barack Obama, the evils of Islam and atheism, and plain red Christmas cups. They have no argument because the facts the party that rules them feeds them are fabrications and fear tactics.If right-wingers don t like the fact that they have an extremist problem and that their own kind become radicalized and commit unimaginable acts of terror, they should do something about their own message. You can t have people running around vowing to die for their country when their country needs them to just stay home and count their rounds of ammo.Nobody wants that kind of person near them, which extends to our online persona. When a right-winger takes to social media and promises some  libtard  180 grains of Chris Kyle-like justice, they ve just broken the rules and committed a crime, all at the same time.They shouldn t be kicked off of Twitter why? Enough of those people together in groups become what terrorist organizations call  cells.  Here in America, we call them  militias.  Twitter is said to have deleted 44,000 accounts associated with ISIS.

        "text": "Bombs a-w oh, never mind Things must be going well in the  war on terror,  as the US Air Force just admitted that it is fast running out of bombs to drop on ISIS after  B-1s have dropped bombs in record numbers.  As ZeeNews reports, Air Force chief of staff General Mark Welsh said as America ramps up its military campaign against the Islamist terror group, the Air Force is now  expending munitions faster than we can replenish them. The US Air Force is fast running out of bombs to drop on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq after its pilots fired off over 20,000 missiles and bombs since the US bombing campaign against the terror group began 15 months ago, its chief has said. As ZeeNews reports, B-1s have dropped bombs in record numbers. F-15Es are in the fight because they are able to employ a wide range of weapons and do so with great flexibility. We need the funding in place to ensure we re prepared for the long fight,  Welsh said in the statement. This is a critical need,  he said.The bombing campaign has left the US Air Force with what an Air Force official described as munitions depot stocks  below our desired objective. The Air Force has requested additional funding for Hellfire missiles and is developing plans to ramp up weapons production to replenish its stocks more quickly. But replenishing that stock can take  up to four years from time of expenditure to asset resupply,  the official told CNN. The precision today s wars requires demands the right equipment and capability to achieve desired effects. We need to ensure the necessary funding is in place to not only execute today s wars, but also tomorrow s challenges,  the official said. As The Washington Times concludes, Russia has been bombing ISIS positions sporadically while France and Great Britain are now active in the American-led coalition which could relieve some pressure.Much larger potential adversaries like Russia or China most surely are following this development carefully. If the USAF cannot sustain a trickling battle against a poorly armed, medieval enemy, fighting a superpower military is obviously beyond its capability.Via: Zero Hedge",

        "text": "Maxine is the worst enemy of the black community and Americans! She needs the struggle to continue so she can be reelected. Wouldn t it be dangerous to her reelection if Donald Trump was successful at helping the black community? The fear mongering is how she gets reelected! Remember the housing crisis? Maxine was responsible for much of the crash in housing yet she s never taken responsibility for it. She and Barnie Frank pushed and pushed to get home loans for people who should have never owned a home! The black community should run this woman out of town! In the period 1989-2008, topping the list of recipients of contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Sen. Dodd (D-Connecticut), who received $165,400. Second on the list is Sen. Obama (D-Illinois), receiving $126,349 with only three years in the Senate. Rep. Frank (D-Massachusetts), received $42,350.February 1990Madeline Talbott, a well-known radical ACORN leader and banking industry agitator, challenged the merger of a Chicago thrift, Bell Federal Savings and Loan Association, who responded that they were being bullied into irresponsible  affirmative-action lending policy. 1991ACORN interfered with a House Banking Committee meeting for two days protesting a move to bring CRA reform.1992Enforcement of CRA was  sporadic,  as the Washington Times notes, until a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study asserted that there were  substantially higher denial rates for black and Hispanic applicants than for white applicants.  Co-author Lynn Browne was approached by co-author Alicia Munnell to do the study because  community activists were complaining that mortgage loans were not being made in minority communities. According to the Times, however,  the study had mishandled statistics on minority default rates. When the errors were accounted for, the same study showed no evidence that nonwhite mortgage applicants were being discriminated against.  Frank Quaratiello, writing in the Boston Herald, cites Stan Liebowitz,  My guess is that they were interested in finding a particular result.  Said Liebowitz,  Richard Syron was head of the Boston Fed at the time. He went on to be the head of Freddie Mac. They were looking for mortgage discrimination and they found it.  According to Quaratiello, Syron became Freddie Mac CEO and chairman in 2003 and  faced increasing pressure to buy up more and more risky mortgages, some of which the Boston Fed s guide had, in effect, served to legitimize.  Regarding Syron s total compensation in 2007 of $18.3 million, Liebowitz reportedly quipped,  Nice reward for presiding over unprofessional research behavior, bankrupting Freddie Mac and crippling our financial system, all in the name of politically correct lending. September 1992The Chicago Tribune described the ACORN agenda as  affirmative action lending.  And, writes Kurtz,  ACORN was issuing fact sheets bragging about relaxations of credit standards that it had won on behalf of minorities. October 1992Congress, enacting the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, allowed legislation to  amend and extend certain laws relating to housing and community development.  The Act created the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) within HUD to  ensure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are adequately capitalized and operating safely.  It also  established HUD-imposed housing goals for financing of affordable housing and housing in central cities and other rural and underserved areas. Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) warned about the impending danger non-regulated GSEs posed. As the Washington Post reports, his concern was that Congress was  hamstringing  the regulator. Complaint was that OFHEO was a  weak regulator.  Leach worried that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were changing  from being agencies of the public at large to money machines for the stockholding few. Rep. Barney Frank (D-Massachusetts) countered, as the Post reports,  the companies served a public purpose. They were in the business of lowering the price of mortgage loans. September 1993The Chicago Sun-Times reports an initiative led by ACORN s Talbott with five area lenders  participating in a $55 million national pilot program with affordable-housing group ACORN to make mortgages for low- and moderate-income people with troubled credit histories.  Kurtz notes that the initiative included two of her former targets, Bell Federal Savings and Avondale Federal Savings, who had apparently capitulated under pressure.July 1994Represented by Obama and others, Plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit alleging that Citibank had  intentionally discriminated against the Plaintiffs on the basis of race with respect to a credit transaction,  calling their action  racial discrimination and discriminatory redlining practices. November 1994President Clinton addresses homeownership:  I think we all agree that more Americans should own their own homes, for reasons that are economic and tangible and reasons that are emotional and intangible but go to the heart of what it means to harbor, to nourish, to expand the American dream. . . . I am determined to see that you have the opportunity and together we can make that opportunity for the young families of our country. I am committed to a new and unprecedented partnership between industry leaders and community leaders and Government to recommit our Nation to the idea of homeownership and to create more homeowners than ever before. June 1995Republicans had won control of Congress and planned CRA reforms. The Clinton Administration, however, allied with Rep. Frank, Sen. Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) and Rep. Waters (D-California), did an end-around by directing HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo to inject GSEs into the subprime mortgage market.As Kurtz notes, ACORN had come to Congress not only to protect the CRA from GOP reforms but also to expand the reach of quota-based lending to Fannie, Freddie and beyond.  What resulted was the broadening of the  acceptability of risky subprime loans throughout the financial system, thus precipitating our current crisis. The administration announced the bold new homeownership strategy which included monumental loosening of credit standards and imposition of subprime lending quotas. HUD reported that President Clinton had committed  to increasing the homeownership rate to 67.5 percent by the year 2000.  The plan was  to reduce the financial, information, and systemic barriers to homeownership  which was  amplified by local partnerships at work in over 100 cities. Kurtz concludes,  Urged on by ACORN, congressional Democrats and the Clinton administration helped push tolerance for high-risk loans through every sector of the banking system   far beyond the sort of banks originally subject to the CRA. So it was the efforts of ACORN and its Democratic allies that first spread the subprime virus from the CRA to Fannie and Freddie and thence to the entire financial system. Soon, Democratic politicians and regulators actually began to take pride in lowered credit standards as a sign of  fairness    and the contagion spread. Attorney General Janet Reno, with a number of bank lending discrimination settlements already, sternly announces,  We will tackle lending discrimination wherever it appears.  With the new policy in full force,  No loan is exempt; no bank is immune.   For those who thumb their nose at us, I promise vigorous enforcement,  reiterated Reno.1997HUD Secretary Cuomo said  GSE presence in the subprime market could be of significant benefit to lower-income families, minorities, and families living in underserved areas . . . 1998By falsifying signatures on Fannie Mae accounting transactions, $200 million in expenses was shifted from 1998 to later periods, thereby triggering $27.1 million in bonuses for top executives. James A. Johnson received $1.932 million; Franklin D. Raines received $1.11 million; Lawrence M. Small received $1.108 million; Jamie S. Gorelick received $779,625; Timothy Howard received $493,750; Robert J. Levin received $493,750.April 1998HUD announced a $2.1 billion settlement with AccuBanc Mortgage Corp. for alleged discrimination against minority loan applicants. The funds would provide poor families with down payments and low interest mortgages. Announcing the Accubank settlement, Secretary Cuomo said,  discrimination isn t always that obvious. Sometimes more subtle but in many ways more insidious, an institutionalized discrimination that s hidden behind a smiling face. October 2003Fannie Mae discloses $1.2 billion accounting error.November 2003Council of the Economic Advisers Chairman Greg Mankiw warned,  The enormous size of the mortgage-backed securities market means that any problems at the GSEs matter for the financial system as a whole. This risk is a systemic issue also because the debt obligations of the housing GSEs are widely held by other financial institutions. The importance of GSE debt in the portfolios of other financial entities means that even a small mistake in GSE risk management could have ripple effects throughout the financial system,  from a White House release.Mankiw explains that any  legislation to reform GSE regulation should empower the new regulator with sufficient strength and credibility to reduce systemic risk.  To reduce the potential for systemic instability, the regulator would have  broad authority to set both risk-based and minimum capital standards  and  receivership powers necessary to wind down the affairs of a troubled GSE,  says a White House release.February 2004Fiscal Year 2005 Budget again highlights the risk posed by the explosive growth of the GSEs and their low levels of required capital, and called for creation of a new, world-class regulator:  The Administration has determined that the safety and soundness regulators of the housing GSEs lack sufficient power and stature to meet their responsibilities, and therefore . . . should be replaced with a new strengthened regulator,  reports a White House release.Mankiw cautions Congress to  not take [the financial market s] strength for granted.  Again, the call from the Administration was to reduce this risk by  ensuring that the housing GSEs are overseen by an effective regulator,  says a White House release.June 2004Deputy Secretary of Treasury Samuel Bodman spotlights the risk posed by the GSEs and called for reform, saying  We do not have a world-class system of supervision of the housing government sponsored enterprises (GSEs), even though the importance of the housing financial system that the GSEs serve demands the best in supervision to ensure the long-term vitality of that system. Therefore, the Administration has called for a new, first class, regulatory supervisor for the three housing GSEs: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banking System,  the White House reports.September 2004OFHEO reported that Fannie Mae and CEO Raines had manipulated its accounting to overstate its profits. Congress and the Bush administration sought strong new regulation and authority to put the GSEs under conservatorship if necessary. As the Washington Post reports, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac responded by orchestrating a major campaign  by traditional allies including real estate agents, home builders and mortgage lenders. Fannie Mae ran radio and television ads ahead of a key Senate committee meeting, depicting a Latino couple who fretted that if the bill passed, mortgage rates would go up.  Again, GSE pressure prevailed.October 2004Rep. Baker again warned about the coming crisis in the Wall Street Journal:  Then there s the lesson of a company, Frankenstein-like, seemingly grown so powerful that it can intimidate and arrogantly flout all accountability to the very government that created it. Baker adds,  Although their bonds bear the disclaimer  not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government,  the market does not believe it and looks right past the companies  risk strategies to the taxpayers  pockets. In a subcommittee testimony, Democrats vehemently reject regulation of Fannie Mae in the face of dire warning of a Fannie Mae oversight report. A few of them, Black Caucus members in particular, are very angry at the OFHEO Director as they attempt to defend Fannie Mae and protect their CRA extortion racket.Chairman Baker (R-Louisiana):  It is indeed a very troubling report, but it is a report of extraordinary importance not only to those who wish to own a home, but as to the taxpayers of this country who would pay the cost of the clean up of an enterprise failure. . . . The analysis makes clear that more resources must be brought to bear to ensure the highest standards of conduct are not only required, but more importantly, they are actually met. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-California):  Through nearly a dozen hearings where, frankly, we were trying to fix something that wasn t broke. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-California):  Mr. Chairman, we do not have a crisis at Freddie Mac, and particularly at Fannie Mae, under the outstanding leadership of Mr. Frank Raines. Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-New York):  And as well as the fact that I m just pissed off at OFHEO, because if it wasn t for you I don t think that we d be here in the first place, and now the problem that we have and that we re faced with is: maybe some individuals who wanted to do away with GSEs in the first place, you ve given them an excuse to try to have this forum so that we can talk about it and maybe change the, uh, the direction and the mission of what the GSEs had, which they ve done a tremendous job. There s been nothing that was indicated that s wrong, you know, with uh Fannie Mae. Freddie Mac has come up on its own. And the question that then presents is the competence that, that, that, that your agency has, uh, with reference to, uh, uh, deciding and regulating these GSEs. Uh, and so, uh, I wish I could sit here and say that I m not upset with you, but I am very upset because, you know, what you do is give, you know, maybe giving any reason to, as Mr. Gonzales said, to give someone a heart surgery when they really don t need it. Rep. Ed Royce (R-California):  In addition to our important oversight role in this committee, I hope that we will move swiftly to create a new regulatory structure for Fannie Mae, for Freddie Mac, and the federal home loan banks. Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Missouri):  This hearing is about the political lynching of Franklin Raines. Rep. Ed Royce (R-California):  There is a very simple solution. Congress must create a new regulator with powers at least equal to those of other financial regulators, such as the OCC or Federal Reserve. Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-New York):  What would make you, why should I have confidence? Why should anyone have confidence, and uh, in, in you as a regulator at this point? Armando Falcon, OFHEO Director:  Sir, Congressman, OFHEO did not improperly apply accounting rules. Freddie Mac did. OFHEO did not fail to manage earnings properly. Freddie Mac did. So this isn t about the agency engaging in improper conduct. It s about Freddie Mac. Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Connecticut):  And we passed Sarbanes-Oxley, which was a very tough response to that, and then I realized that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac wouldn t even come under it. They weren t under the  34 act, they weren t under the  33 act, they play by their own rules, and I and I m tempted to ask how many people in this room are on the payroll of Fannie Mae, because what they do is they basically hire every lobbyist they can possibly hire. They hire some people to lobby and they hire some people not to lobby so that the opposition can t hire them. Rep. Artur Davis (D-Alabama):  So the concern that I have is you re making very specific, what you have correctly acknowledged, broad and categorical judgments about the management of this institution, about the willfulness of practices that may or may not be in controversy. You ve imputed various motives to the people running the organization. You went to the board and put a 48-hour ultimatum on them without having any specific regulatory authority to put that kind of ultimatum on  em. Uh, that sounds like some kind of an invisible line has been crossed. Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Connecticut):  Fannie Mae has manipulated, in my judgment, OFHEO for years. And for OFHEO to finally come out with a report as strong as it is, tells me that s got to be the minimum not the maximum. Rep. Barney Frank (D-Massachusetts):  Uh, I, this, you, you, you seem to me saying,  Well, these are in areas which could raise safety and soundness problems.  I don t see anything in your report that raises safety and soundness problems. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-California):  Under the outstanding leadership of Mr. Frank Raines, everything in the 1992 Act has worked just fine. In fact, the GSEs have exceeded their housing goals. What we need to do today is to focus on the regulator, and this must be done in a manner so as not to impede their affordable housing mission, a mission that has seen innovation flourish from desktop underwriting to 100% loans. Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Missouri):  I find this to be inconsistent and a and a rush to judgment. I get the feeling that the markets are not worried about the safety and soundness of Fannie Mae as OFHEO says that it is, but of course the markets are not political. Rep. Barney Frank (D-Massachusetts):  But I have seen nothing in here that suggests that the safety and soundness are at issue, and I think it serves us badly to raise safety and soundness as kind of a general shibboleth when it does not seem to me to be an issue. Rep. Don Manzullo (R-Illinois):  Mr. Raines, 1.1 million bonus and a $526,000 salary. Jamie Gorelick, $779,000 bonus on a salary of 567,000. This is, what you state on page eleven is nothing less than staggering. Rep. Don Manzullo (R-Illinois):  The 1998 earnings per share number turned out to be $3.23 and 9 mills, a result that Fannie Mae met the EPS maximum payout goal right down to the penny. Rep. Don Manzullo (R-Illinois):  Fannie Mae understood the rules and simply chose not to follow them that if Fannie Mae had followed the practices, there wouldn t have been a bonus that year. Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Connecticut):  And you have about 3% of your portfolio set aside. If a bank gets below 4%, they are in deep trouble. So I just want you to explain to me why I shouldn t be satisfied with 3%? Franklin Raines, Fannie Mae CEO:  Because banks don t, there aren t any banks who only have multifamily and single-family loans. Franklin Raines, Fannie Mae CEO:  These assets are so riskless that their capital for holding them should be under 2%. January 2005-July 2006Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Nebraska), co-sponsored by Sens. Sununu and Dole and later Sen. McCain, re-introduced legislation to address GSE regulation. The bill prohibited the GSEs from holding portfolios, and gave their regulator prudential authority (such as setting capital requirements) roughly equivalent to a bank regulator. In light of the current financial crisis, this bill was probably the most important piece of financial regulation before Congress in 2005 and 2006,  reports the Wall Street Journal.Greenspan testified that the size of GSE portfolios  poses a risk to the global financial system. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to bail out the lenders [GSEs] . . . should one get into financial trouble.  He added,  If we fail to strengthen GSE regulation, we increase the possibility of insolvency and crisis . . . We put at risk our ability to preserve safe and sound financial markets in the United States, a key ingredient of support for homeownership. Greenspan warned that if the GSEs  continue to grow, continue to have the low capital that they have, continue to engage in the dynamic hedging of their portfolios, which they need to do for interest rate risk aversion, they potentially create ever-growing potential systemic risk down the road . . . We are placing the total financial system of the future at a substantial risk. Bloomberg writes,  If that bill had become law, then the world today would be different. . . . But the bill didn t become law, for a simple reason: Democrats opposed it on a party-line vote in the committee, signaling that this would be a partisan issue. Republicans, tied in knots by the tight Democratic opposition, couldn t even get the Senate to vote on the matter. That such a reckless political stand could have been taken by the Democrats was obscene even then. April 2005Treasury Secretary John Snow again calls for GSE reform,  Events that have transpired since I testified before this Committee in 2003 reinforce concerns over the systemic risks posed by the GSEs and further highlight the need for real GSE reform to ensure that our housing finance system remains a strong and vibrant source of funding for expanding homeownership opportunities in America. . . . Half-measures will only exacerbate the risks to our financial system,  from a White House release.May 2005At AEI Online, Wallison warned that  allowing Fannie and Freddie to continue on their present course is simply to create risks for the taxpayers, and to the economy generally, in order to improve the profits of their shareholders and the compensation of their managements. It is a classic case of socializing the risk while privatizing the profit. January 2006Chairman Greenspan, in a letter to Sens. Sununu, Hagel and Dole, warned that the GSE practice of buying their own MBS  creates substantial systemic risk while yielding negligible additional benefits for homeowners, renters, or mortgage originators.  He stated,  . . . the GSEs and their government regulator need specific and unambiguous Congressional guidance about the intended purpose and functions of Fannie s and Freddie s investment portfolios. March 2006Sens. Sununu and Hagel introduced an amendment to a Lobbying Reform Bill directing GAO to study GSE lobbying and requiring HUD to audit the GSEs annually.May 2006After years of Democrats blocking the legislation, Sens. Hagel, Sununu, Dole and McCain write a letter to Majority Leader William Frist and Chairman Richard Shelby expressing demanding that GSE regulatory reform be  enacted this year  to avoid  the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the Housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole. May 2006Sen. McCain (R-Arizona) addressed the Senate,  Mr. President, this week Fannie Mae s regulator reported that the company s quarterly reports of profit growth over the past few years were  illusions deliberately and systematically created  by the company s senior management. . . . Fannie Mae used its political power to lobby Congress in an effort to interfere with the regulator s examination of the company s accounting problems. . . . OFHEO s report solidifies my view that the GSEs need to be reformed without delay. McCain stressed,  If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole. I urge my colleagues to support swift action on this GSE reform legislation. April 2007Sens. Sununu, Hagel, Dole, and Mel Martinez (R-Florida) re-introduced legislation to improve GSE oversight.April 2007In  A Nightmare Grows Darker,  the New York Times writes that the  democratization of credit  is  turning the American dream of homeownership into a nightmare for many borrowers.  The  newfangled mortgage loans  called  affordability loans   represent 60 percent of foreclosures. September 2007President Bush:  These institutions provide liquidity in the mortgage market that benefits millions of homeowners, and it is vital they operate safely and operate soundly. So I ve called on Congress to pass legislation that strengthens independent regulation of the GSEs . . . the United States Senate needs to pass this legislation soon. 2007-2008The housing bubble began to burst, bad mortgages began to default, and finally the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac portfolios were revealed to be what they were, in collapse. And the testimony is evident as to why. As Wallison noted,  Fannie and Freddie were, I would say, the poster children for corporate welfare. September 2008Rep. Arthur Davis, whose testimony is found above in October 2004, now admits Democrats were in error:  Like a lot of my Democratic colleagues I was too slow to appreciate the recklessness of Fannie and Freddie. I defended their efforts to encourage affordable homeownership when in retrospect I should have heeded the concerns raised by their regulator in 2004. Frankly, I wish my Democratic colleagues would admit when it comes to Fannie and Freddie, we were wrong. Today 2008The narrative is of another socialist experiment failed, this time a massive federal effort, imperiling the whole US banking industry. Facing this economic disaster, will an informed American people put their trust Obama s socialist ideology to bring remedy? To do so is to trust in an acetylene torch to put out the fire.

        "text": "Dirty Harry must ve jarred something in his head that makes him unaware that he s lying in public. He used to be pretty good at hiding it Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is changing the story about how he sustained those gruesome New Year s Day injuries that have left him blind in one eye.Previously, Reid claimed that an exercise band he was using  broke. I was doing exercises that I ve been doing for many years with those large rubber bands and one of them broke and spun me around and I crashed into these cabinets and injured my eye,  (emphasis added) Reid said at a press conference on January 22.(You can see the video of that press conference here.)But now, in an interview conducted by Fusion (a joint venture between ABC and Univision), excerpts of which have been released today, Reid tells Univision anchor Jorge Ramos that the exercise band  slipped,  rather than  broke. [T]he [elastic band] strap had no handle on it, slipped, spun me around, uh, about, oh I guess four feet (Reid points with his right hand to the wall of the interview room) and so I smashed my face into a cabinet,  Reid tells Ramos.Reid s latest version of the incident, as told to Ramos, differs from previous versions advanced by his team in another very significant way. Sources familiar with the incident said Reid was exercising in his bathroom, with the exercise band attached to the shower door,  Politico reported on January 22. (emphasis added)As Breitbart News reported previously, that version of the story, almost certainly told to Politico by Reid s staffers with his approval, is not credible.Now, however, Reid tells Ramos a different story. The exercise band was not attached to the shower door in his bathroom, Reid says, but was instead attached to  a big metal hook that came out from the wall  in an unspecified room in his new Nevada home.Here s a partial transcript of the excerpt of the interview released by Fusion:Ramos: You said recently that the accident had nothing to do with your decision to retire.However, we are seeing the consequences of what happened.What really happened?Was it really with an elastic band?Reid: Yeah, I had a big, that thick (Reid gestures with his hands), that I had been using for about four years and I was, you know, trying to maintain my, uh, firmness, and, uh, that was my weight training. I was doing that in my new home here in Nevada and a big metal hook that came out from the wall that was hooked there that the strap had no handle on it, slipped, spun me around, uh, about, oh I guess four feet (Reid points with his right hand to the wall of the interview room) and so I smashed my face into a cabinet so hard that uh Ramos: It looked like somebody had hit you.Reid: I am so fortunate that, um, it wasn t over just a fraction of this way and hit me in the temple.Ramos: How s your eye?Reid: I am sightless in my right eye.Watch the full video of the excerpts of the Fusion interview here:Ramos then switched gears and asked Reid about  the most difficult moments of [his] 28 years in the Senate. Ramos failed to ask some key follow up questions about Reid s New Year s Day injury incident.For instance, Ramos failed to ask Reid if the accident took place in his bathroom, as Reid s office had previously claimed. According to Reid s latest version of the story, we do not know in which room of his house he now claims he sustained these injuries.Breitbart News has asked Senator Reid s office, which has carefully controlled the release of information about his New Year s Day injuries, to comment on his changed version of the story of his New Year s Day injuries, but has received no reply.Via: Breitbart News",

        "text": "Reality TV star Omarosa Manigault has found herself a pretty sweet position in the Trump administration as the director of communications for the Office of Public Liason   but like all of Trump s team, she is learning that the old adage involving loose lips and sinking vessels (like the Trump administration) applies to her current role.With General Flynn s resignation over his suspicious conversation about sanctions with one of Vladimir Putin s lackeys and all the other disasters Trump has caused, whined about, and made worse through his attempts to clean up his mess, the last thing he needs is one of his people revealing that his administration is collecting information they intend to use to blackmail the press but enter Omarosa.American Urban Radio Networks  White House correspondent April Ryan says that last Wendesday Omarosa threatened her outside the West Wing both physically and otherwise:Manigault, who is now a communications official in the Trump administration, got into a heated argument with a White House reporter just steps from the Oval Office last week, according to witnesses. The reporter, April Ryan, said Manigault  physically intimidated  her in a manner that could have warranted intervention by the Secret Service.Ryan also said Manigault made verbal threats, including the assertion that Ryan was among several journalists on whom Trump officials had collected  dossiers  of negative information.Manigault, a onetime friend of Ryan s, declined to address Ryan s accusations on the record, offering only this emailed statement:  My comment: Fake news!  She did not specify what she considered false.As we have learned by now, when the Trump administration cries  fake news,  the allegations are generally true. Despite Manigault s denials, multiple witnesses confirm that the altercation did take place, with one remarking that the Trump official s actions were  Secret Serviceable,  meaning that it was a situation in which law enforcement needs to intervene.This isn t the first time Omarosa has informed the public of the Trump administration s plan to deal with those they view as enemies. In November, Manigault told the Independent Journal Review that  we re keeping a list  of people who have defied Trump. It s so great our enemies are making themselves clear so that when we get in to the White House, we know where we stand,  she said at the time.If a Trump official admitting that the administration is keeping lists of enemies and compiling  dossiers  for blackmail doesn t concern you, then there is something wrong.Featured image via Getty Images",

        "text": "Patrick Henningsen  21st Century WireWhat s up with the millennials? The Clinton campaign may have felt a jolt after seeing the front page headline from this morning s Wall Street Journal which read, Millennials Have Cooled on Hillary Clinton, Forcing a Campaign Reset. Traditionally, the 21 to 35 year old age bracket (born 1980-1993 in our epoch) has been a bastion of the Democratic Party. According to a recent Quinnipiac poll, Hillary Clinton s lead over Republican Donald J. Trump among under 35 s plummeted in the month of August from 25 points  down to only 5 points. Pretty shocking, but even more so in a week that has seen a Hillary health scare, resulting in Trump surging ahead of Clinton in multiple national polls, and also in perennially pivotal electoral patches like Florida and Ohio.So what s up? Why can t Hillary chill with the millennials, like Barack once did?Back when she was battling Bernie Sanders in the primaries, Clinton pulled out all the stops for the millennials   even promising America s students a  debt free  college experience including free university tuition. Somehow, Hillary s sizzle has failed to produce the Bern with this crucial demographic. As much as they would love for it to be true, even the most optimistic of students knows that free tuition for all is nothing more than pie in the sky, with some left feeling patronized in a way that voters have come to expect from desperate politicians making increasingly desperate promises on the campaign trail these days. What s really being overlooked by Democrat Party elites here though, is the uncomfortable truth that the old party ways simply aren t working anymore, and the Clinton campaign is not viewed as transformative (as Colin Powell calls it) and thus, millennials are finding it difficult to get behind it.So if they are no longer with Hillary, where are they going? Definitely not to the GOP. Trump is a non-starter when it comes to millennials, many of which are already registered Democrats. No offense to Trump supporters, but that s just the way it is   there s simply not enough young deplorable jugend to go around. Both Trump and Clinton are two of the oldest potential president elects ever to face off in a general election, at 70, 69 yrs old respectively. Instead, a sizeable number of young swing(ing) voters are flocking to Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, who is currently polling at around 9% nationally, and also to Green Party candidate Jill Stein who is polling around 4%.One aspect worth noting here is that, unlike their generational predecessors, 21st century millennials are not afraid to take a risk on what they might view as a  political start-up  like the Libertarian or Green party. While traditional two-party system dinosaurs dream of squeezing rich donors at fundraising dinners, millennials dream of Podemos and crowdfunding the next revolution. But digital Jerusalem is still a ways off, and here is where idealism inevitably clashes with hard-core political reality: with the Trump-Clinton race in a near dead heat, millennials who have migrated into those alternative Johnson and Stein camps will indirectly decide the 2016 Election in much the same way that Independent candidate Ralph Nader did in 2000 and to a lesser extent in 2004, although it s not so easy to calculate between Clinton and Trump exactly who will be the chief beneficiary from that alternative displacement vote. CHILLERY: Clinton is struggling to excite the millennial voters (Illustration: TrumpNews)There is another spanner in the Democratic machine which no one is talking about, and one which could certainly hurt Hillary Clinton, and help Donald Trump on November 8th. One pronounced crimp in the Clinton juggernaut came as a result of the Wikileaks  DNC email leaks which revealed how, in its effort to shoe-in Clinton ahead of this past summer s party convention, the Democratic Party conspired to railroad the Bernie Sanders campaign  effectively killing its mercurial millennial phenomenon. Old party hacks might not understand why this is so important because they are so wrapped up in time-honored Tammany Hall traditions, but to young idealistic millennials, this party betrayal would not only be viewed as unfair, but also as undemocratic, and rightly so. As a result, a nationwide write-in campaign for Sanders as President has begun to pick up steam. If this pulls in 2%, or even 1%   away from Hillary s tally, especially in the key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Arizona or Michigan, then the race becomes even tighter still, and more unpredictable.This excerpt from the Reason report (below) should be the most sobering of all for Democrats, and it reveals the source of their fatal disconnect:A Reason-Rupe poll of millennials in 2014 found 66 percent of them believing government was wasteful and inefficient even as many said they planned to vote Democrat in that year and in 2016. The drop off in support for Democrats is unsurprising, given that the rhetoric about government that Democrats deploy does not match the reality on the ground.In other word: the Democrats are as addicted to lying as any other political organization, and this cannot be fixed   it s an institutional thing.In order to shore-up the millennial gap, the Democratic Party has dispatched its cohort of  rock stars  to college campuses across the country in order to woo millennials. Michelle Obama, Elizabeth Warren, and even Sanders (how Bernie could go out stumping after the DNC Leaks is pretty amazing in itself) have been sent like missionaries to the four corners of the country, in order to try and win back those millions of lost liberal souls, and lead them back into the party flock.To millennials, Bernie Sanders  primary election loss dashed their hopes in much the same way Ron Paul supporters felt in 2012  betrayed by a collusion between party mob bosses and the mainstream media. In both cases, aside from the obvious corruption, what was really dashed was the idealistic view that their generation had a real and meaningful stake in US politics and could even elevate its own candidate in a national election. Millions of previously disengaged voters finally found an original voice that resonated with their generation, and to see that voice crushed by political insiders and media operatives is a bitter pill to swallow. In America s winner-take-all system of Presidential elections, there is only room for one party winner   a reality which will continue to frustrate young voters going forward, many of whom are well aware of parliamentary systems in other nation states, and systems which appear to allow more plurality when it comes to choosing a viable political leader. Like it or not, managing those global expectations in terms of party and leadership choice is a reality that America will have to contend with in the future.With so many free radicals  still orbiting this election, it will be tricky to project a clear winner. Shades of 2000 perhaps, but this year there will be no hanging chads, but maybe something worse. Half the voters will be blaming either Obama (vote rigging), or Putin (vote hacking), as a reaction to any perceived electoral stitch-up (see #HashTagHell).It s a tricky year for the bookies, but one thing you can bet on is a serious fall-out after election day. So brace yourself, because in case you haven t noticed, many Americans are viewing this election as a true do or die  moment.In a United States already polarized along very pronounced partisan lines, whichever the result, one side will be baying for blood. That s just the way it is this year.Author Patrick Henningsen is journalist and geopolitical analyst for 21WIRE and host of the SUNDAY WIRE weekly radio show and also ON THE QT podcast@21WIRE.TV. Here s more useful analysis on the 2016  millennial dynamic  from Ed Krayewski at Reason ReasonA number of new polls show Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson doing very well with millennials and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton underperforming with the same demographic that helped President Obama build winning coalitions in 2008 and 2012.A New York Times/CBS poll shows 26 percent of voters under the age of 29 supporting Johnson and a further 10 percent supporting Green presidential nominee Jill Stein. Similarly, a Quinnipiac poll shows Johnson at 29 percent of young voters, and Stein at 15. In that poll, Clinton barely edges out Johnson among young voters, getting 31 percent. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is at 26 percent among that demographic in the poll. Further, a Global Strategy Group poll of millennials in 11 battleground states found 73 percent of millennials saying that Trump was a racist, and just 38 percent supporting Clinton in a 4-way matchup.The results have yielded unsurprising hand-wringing from older liberals who feel the vote of millennials belongs to them. Clara Jeffrey, editor-in-chief of Mother Jones, tweeted that she has  never hated millennials more  in response to the NYT/CBS poll, which earned refreshing responses from millennials Continue this story at ReasonREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",

        "title": " Hotel Workers Smashed Trump In A MASSIVE Victory",
        "text": "Bad news for Donald Trump! Despite his objections, workers at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, just delivered a huge f*ck you to The Donald with the assistance of the National Labor Relations Board. Since the employees voted to unionize in December, Trump has been fighting racist tooth and Islamophobic nail against the idea that workers deserve some modicum of self-determination   but it seems that even his  huge  hands were not enough to stop the NLRB from officially certifying the union.This comes after numerous dirty tricks, including the use of scare tactics and ironic attempts to convince the Board to throw out the workers  vote because employees were allegedly  intimidated  into agreeing to unionize in the first place. But, of course, it was Trump s goons doing the intimidating: They pressured us a lot [to vote no],  housekeeper Marisela Olvera told ThinkProgress.  They told us the union only wants our money, that if we supported the union we d lose our jobs, that the company would put our names on a blacklist and no other hotels in Las Vegas would hire us. They told us to think of what our children would do if we were out of work. Everyone was very stressed. People were afraid. But bendito sea Di s, we still won, even with all that pressure. Now, Think Progress reports that (with Trump s appeal going about as well as his attempts to win over anyone who isn t a white, straight Christian male) workers are demanding that management tuck its tail between its legs, sit down with them like adults, and work out a contract. We re just waiting for a contract,  housekeeper Maria Jaramillo told the publication.  We deserve one. We re not second-class workers. So we re here, waiting for him. Unfortunately, they may have to wait a while longer. Management says they intend to appeal the Labor Board s decision:Jaramillo and her coworkers then formed a bargaining committee, hoping that management would soon recognize their union and begin negotiating with them. But the Trump hotel signaled this week that they have no intention of doing so. We will continue our fight to ensure a fair election for our valued associates, many of whom vigorously oppose union representation,  said Jill Martin, an attorney for The Trump Organization, in a statement to reporters.  The hearing officer s recommendations erroneously disregarded the severe misconduct undertaken by Union agents, which clearly impacted an incredibly close election.  Trump management has until next week to formally challenge the NLRB recommendation, and then the Board s regional chapter will determine whether or not to certify the union. Even if the local board backs the workers, Trump can further delay by appealing their ruling to the federal board in Washington, D.C. Mr. Trump is a very good business man,  linens worker Rosebert Donato told ThinkProgress, apparently using a loose definition of both  good  and  businessman. Donoto hopes Trump will grow up, put on his big boy pants, and sit down to discuss things with the workers. He says he wants to make America great,  Olvera says.  Well, he should start here in his own house, his own business. He always brags about how he has millions and millions and millions of dollars, but he pays his workers less than most in Las Vegas.

The email, among thousands hacked from Podesta s account, was published last month by WikiLeaks.Clinton signed an ethics agreement governing her family s globe-straddling foundation in order to become secretary of state in 2009. The agreement was designed to increase transparency to avoid appearances that U.S. foreign policy could be swayed by wealthy donors.If a new foreign government wished to donate or if an existing foreign-government donor, such as Qatar, wanted to  increase materially  its support of ongoing programs, Clinton promised that the State Department s ethics official would be notified and given a chance to raise any concerns.Clinton Foundation officials last month declined to confirm the Qatar donation.Read more: Breitbart",

        "text": "21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE reported earlier this week, the unlikely  mishap  of two US Naval vessels straying into Iranian waters   just hours before the President s State of the Union speech, followed by the usual parade of arch-neocons coming on TV in real time to declare the incident as  an act of aggression  by Iran against the United States   is no mere coincidence.24 hours after the incident, the Iranians returned all 11 US sailors, unharmed and in good spirits. The only remaining casualty from this event was an incident of a common condition in Washington known as  Pre-Traumatic Stress Disorder    suffered by a certain US Senator was mortified by the uneventful outcome which followed Daniel McAdams Ron Paul Institute  The two US Navy riverine command boats intercepted in Iranian territorial waters yesterday were sent on their way along with the crew of 10 US sailors after brief detention on Iranian soil.According to news reports, the well-armed warships either suffered mechanical or navigational difficulties which caused them to enter Iranian territory (although it may well have been a game of cat-and-mouse to test the Iranian response). The US sailors were apparently treated well, enjoyed what appeared a decent meal in relaxed surroundings, and in the end apologized for the mistake and praised their treatment by the Iranians. Thanks to President Obama s policy shift on Iran toward engagement and away from isolationism, Secretary of State John Kerry was able to telephone his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Zarif and quickly defuse what just months ago would have been a far more serious situation.This should be a good-news story about the value of diplomacy and reducing tensions with adversaries, but Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) was having none of it. That Kerry expressed his appreciation to the Iranians for swiftly releasing the American sailors only showed the Obama Administration s  craven desire to preserve the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal at all costs evidently knows no limit,  said McCain in a press release.McCain was furious that  Obama administration officials seem to be falling over themselves to offer praise for Iran s graciousness  and was outraged that the Iranians dared interfere with the actions of US military vessels operating in Iranian waters.In the world of John McCain, only the United States has the right to national sovereignty. The US military has the right to act anywhere and everywhere and the rest of the world dare not raise a question.According to McCain,  sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention, boarding, or search. Their crews are not subject to detention or arrest. Imagine the tune McCain would have been singing if a well-armed Iranian naval vessel had been spotted in US territorial waters off the coast of New York. Would he have so rigorously condemned any US interference in the actions of Iran s sovereign naval vessels?Leave it to some clever Twitterers to post an example of the difference between US and Iranian detention.Copyright   2016 by RonPaul Institute.

        "title": " Romney Reminds America Why They Didn\u2019t Elect Him: Trump\u2019s Obama Birtherism No Big Deal (VIDEO)",
        "text": "Having been quiet since his presidential campaign went down in flames in 2012, Mitt Romney is suddenly back in the spotlight after forcefully condemning current Republican front-runner Donald Trump. But while it s great that Romney sees the inherent bigotry in Trump s message and wants to condemn it, there s just one problem: Romney loved Trump back when he was running for president.Or as Trump himself recently crudely put it: He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said,  Mitt, drop to your knees,  and he would have dropped to his knees. He was begging. True. He was begging me. In an interview with CNN s Gloria Borger, Romney was forced to defend his earlier opportunistic praise for Trump   and things quickly went off the rails.When Borger mentioned Trump s endorsement, Romney said at the time Trump didn t seem that bad. Like a good journalist, Borger didn t let him off the hook. Instead, she noted that there were already signs that Donald Trump was a world-class scumbag. After all, he was the  godfather of the Obama birther movement. Romney, in the sort of hypocrisy he became known for during his election campaign, managed to remind us why we didn t vote for him in the first place. Trump s birtherism wasn t a big deal, but attacking Megyn Kelly is.Well, no. I think that s a very different thing than calling Mexicans rapists, than saying that Muslims are not going to be allowed into the country as immigrants, than mocking a disabled reporter, going after women and saying oh, she asks tough questions because she was in her menstrual cycle is highly offensive. I said I disagreed with him. There are political views about one another where we re going to disagree, but what he has said during this campaign, that George W. Bush is a liar, that John McCain isn t a hero. I mean, he said some things that are completely, totally outrageous.So when he makes racist attacks against Obama during Romney s presidential campaign, Romney has no problem, but now that he is undermining the GOP s effort to appeal to minorities or calling George W. Bush a liar, suddenly Romney is feeling very sanctimonious.It was no secret that Mitt Romney spent much of his campaign publicly finger wagging at his voters for obsessing over Obama s birth certificate, while at the same time playing up the controversy at every opportunity. In August of 2012, Romney even took it a step further and stoked the flames himself with this appalling  joke. I love being home, in this place where Ann and I were raised. Where both of us were born No one s ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know that this is the place that we were born and raised. So when Romney says he disagrees with Trump  now  on the issues, it s only because four years ago, Trump s disgusting racism could be used as a means to an end   whip up the racists and get them to the polls. It s hard to imagine a person having less credibility on the issue of integrity than Mitt Romney.Watch the interview below via CNN (Birther comments begin around the 4:20 mark)Featured image via CNN",

        "text": "The Washington Post   Nearly a third of territory reclaimed from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria since 2014 has been won in the past six months, due to new policies adopted by the Trump administration, a senior State Department official said Friday.Brett McGurk, the State Department s senior envoy to the anti-Islamic State coalition, said that steps President Trump has taken, including delegating decision-making authority down from the White House to commanders in the field, have  dramatically accelerated  gains against the militants.Combined Islamic State losses in both countries since the group s peak control in early 2015 total about 27,000 square miles of territory   78 percent of militant holdings in Iraq and 58 percent in Syria. About 8,000 square miles have been reclaimed under Trump, McGurk said in a briefing for reporters.Although the Trump administration has yet to announce its new strategy for the campaign against the Islamic State, McGurk cited  key changes  under Trump. In addition to the delegation of decision-making authority, which he said has allowed much greater responsiveness to opportunities and changing circumstances, he cited a  campaign of annihilation  that has concentrated on surrounding cities held by the militants before launching offensives, to ensure that no militants will escape.He said the 2,000 militants remaining in Raqqa  most likely will die in Raqqa.  The United Nations has estimated that 25,000 civilians also remain in the city.McGurk, who held the same job in the Obama administration, also cited renewed administration efforts to  increase burden sharing from the coalition  among what he said were 73 countries. Most of them do not contribute to the warfighting but are expected to help with stabilization efforts in cleared areas, including in the Iraqi city of Mosul, where U.S.-backed Iraq security forces declared victory over the Islamic State last month.",

        "text": "Rapper Killer Mike, will appear in front of a SOLD OUT audience at the prestigious MIT University today.  Here s a clip from an interview with Jew hater and racist Louis Farrakhan:He s a follower and admirer of this racist Jew hater. He s clearly one of the most angry black men in the  entertainment  business. After watching this interview, you will better understand the mentality of the protestors  on the streets who are getting in the faces of cops (of whom the majority are good men and women protecting and defending the citizens within their jurisdiction). It should be noted, that  Killer Mike s  dad was a police officer or  dirty pig  as he likes to call them.Killer Mike views rap as social activism, and never shies away from sharing his opinions on race and abuses of power. Whether he s condemning institutionalized corruption in  Reagan  or speaking out against police brutality with Run The Jewels   Close Your Eyes,  if Killer Mike thinks it s messed up, he s going to let you know.This Friday, April 24, MIT students will have the chance to hear how messed up race relations are, when Killer Mike delivers a lecture titled  Race Relations in the U.S.  at the school. According to the press release, he ll be talking about how current and advancing technology are shaping race relations. (We re guessing that he doesn t regard drone surveillance as a democratizing agent.) Chances are pretty good that Killer Mike will also be addressing the spate of well-publicized police shootings of young unarmed black men and their systemic social consequences.Here is an example of the most recent  music  video by Killer Mike.  ****WARNING****Violence and strong language***Killer Mike s lecture is the second in MIT s new Hip-Hop Speaker Series, which opened with Young Guru. The series is the result of a collaboration between the Arts at MIT and TapTape, an MIT-based music startup. The series  stated goal is to bring  together leaders in hip-hop with leading faculty and students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  That s a perfect opportunity for a mathematics seminar featuring Dr. Octagon and Dr. Roman Bezrukavnikov, Professor of Algebraic Geometry.While Killer Mike s lecture certainly sounds intriguing, Friday s lecture is exclusively available to MIT students and is already sold out. But if you re jonesing to hear Killer Mike drop some heated words, there s always the extremely-NSFW  Big Beast  video, featuring Bun B and T.I.We were going to include the  Big Beast  video, but after viewing this disturbing video, which includes nudity, horrific acts of violence and an attempted rape scene, we decided against it. The driver in the video is wearing a Ronald Reagan mask because  Killer Mike  believes that all of the problems plaguing the black community are as a result of Ronald Reagan s presidency.

        "text": "Why does FOX News even give this guy a microphone? He lost his relevance about a decade ago, and yet FOX News still thinks Americans care about anything he has to say. He was against gun control before he was for it Republican strategist Karl Rove said on  Fox News Sunday  the only way to stop gun-related violence, like the Wednesday massacre at Emmanuel African Methodist Church in Charleston S.C., was to repeal American citizens  Second Amendment rights.When Chris Wallace asked Rove how we can,  stop the violence,  the long-time gun-rights advocate stated that we have made great strides as a nation in empathizing with the victims of these types of shootings, but the only way to guarantee they will stop is to  remove guns from society. What do you think?WALLACE: How do we stop the violence?What do you think? ROVE: I wish I had an easy answer for that, but I don t think there s an easy answerWhat do you think? We saw an act of evil. Racist, bigoted evil, and to me the amazing thing is that it was met with grief and love. Think about how far we ve come since 1963. The whole weight of the government throughout the South was to impede finding and holding and bringing to justice the men who perpetrated the [Birmingham] bombing.What do you think? And here, we saw an entire state, an entire community, an entire nation come together, grieving as one and united in the belief that this was an evil act, so we ve come a long way.What do you think? Now maybe there s some magic law that will keep us from having more of these. I mean basically the only way to guarantee that we will dramatically reduce acts of violence involving guns is to basically remove guns from society, and until somebody gets enough  oomph  to repeal the Second Amendment, that s not going to happen.Via: Daily Caller",

        "title": "JUDGE WHO COULD REPLACE SCALIA Has No Track Record On Social Issues EXCEPT This Big Ruling",
        "text": "Judge Sri Srinivasan is a possible pick for Obama to replace Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court. We only know one particular case where he paved the way for gay marriage. Social issues like abortion and gay marriage are BIG sticking points for conservatives. Could a judge who has no track record on social issues be appointed by Obama? This would be a smart move on Obama s part because there would be no ammunition for declining this nominee. One possible contender to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court is an Indian-American appeals court judge, Sri Srinivasan, who has pro-business credentials and a stellar resume.If he was nominated his background may make it more politically challenging for Republicans as they plan to block anyone put forward by President Barack Obama.Srinivasan, 48, has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since he was confirmed on a 97-0 bipartisan vote in the U.S. Senate in May 2013. Republican senators who supported him then would likely be asked to justify why they couldn t back him for the Supreme Court.Many names are likely under consideration and the White House has not tipped its hand, but recent Supreme Court appointments have tended to be appeals court judges and the appeals court in Washington on which Srinivasan serves has often been a springboard to the high court. Scalia himself served on the court, as did other Supreme Court members Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.The White House said on Sunday that Obama will wait until the U.S. Senate is back in session before making a nomination. The Senate returns from recess on Feb. 22.Republicans have called for Scalia s seat to remain open so that the next president, who would take office in January 2017, can nominate a replacement. Other judges Obama could consider appointing include Paul Watford, a black man who serves on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and Jacqueline Nguyen, a Vietnamese-American woman who serves on the same court as Watford.Little is known about Srinivasan s views on divisive social issues like abortion and affirmative action. But as a senior Justice Department lawyer in 2013, he was part of the legal team that successfully urged the high court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that restricted the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples for the purposes of federal benefits. The ruling helped pave the way for the court s ruling in June 2015 that legalized gay marriage nationwide.Via: Reuters",

        "text": "For the entirety of Donald Trump s presidential campaign, there was a massive amount of suspicion surrounding the reality television star s relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin. It turns out that just two days after Trump has gotten elected to be the next President of the United States, most of our instincts were correct.On Thursday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov confirmed that  there were contacts  between the Trump campaign the Russian embassy staff throughout this election. He said: Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage. Those people have always been in the limelight in the United States and have occupied high-ranking positions. I cannot say that all of them but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives. This news comes after we d already seen various instances where Trump embraced and praised Putin during his campaign, giving the impression that these two might actually be best friends. Trump had also said he would improve America s relations with Russia, and told NATO allies  they ll need to pay tribute to the United States if they want to continue to have protection against possible Russian aggression. Trump s relationship with Russia concerned intelligence and foreign policy experts alike   and it should concern all of us as well. Trump has lied about his relationship with Russia   much like he has lied about everything else in his presidential campaign. Trump repeatedly told Americans that he had not been interacting with the Kremlin even in the face of evidence that he was praising Putin. Once again, Ryabkov contradicted Trump s previous denial when he said: We have just begun to consider ways of building dialogue with the future Donald Trump administration and channels we will be using for those purposes. It s also useful to point out that Trump s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort resigned from the campaign after the New York Times reported that ledgers discovered in Ukraine found that millions of dollars had been earmarked for Trump from the pro-Russian political party of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. If that isn t shady, I don t know what is.Now that the election is over, Trump s lies are being exposed one by one. His followers are going to be devastated when they find out who they really elected.Featured image via Adam Berry and Mark Wilson / Getty Images",

        "title": " George Zimmerman Is Selling The Gun He Used To Murder Trayvon Martin In Cold Blood (VIDEO)",
        "text": "***UPDATE***The listing has been removed, and Zimmerman almost assuredly feels like a victim.George Zimmerman is terrible. A habitual woman abuser and child killer-turned-terrible-painter, the man who sparked national controversy by stalking and murdering Trayvon Martin in 2012 just proved that he has absolutely no shame. None at all. Not even the teensiest little bit. Zimmerman has said that he feels no regret for gunning down Martin, despite that police told him to stay in his car and not to engage when Zimmerman called 911 to report that someone walking through the neighborhood looked a little too black for his taste. Not even the fact that Martin was armed with only a can of Arizona and a pack of Skittles phases the right-wing hero. In fact, Zimmerman genuinely believes he is the victim in all this.Given his rather disturbed mentality, it is unsurprising that George is doing the most despicable thing he has done since the night he murdered an unarmed African-American child who was simply walking home: He s selling the gun he used to murder Trayvon Martin. I m a free American. I can do what I like with my possessions,  Zimmerman told WOFL on Wednesday night.  It s time to move past the firearm. And if I sell it and it sells, I move past it. Otherwise, it s going in a safe for my grandkids and [is] never to be, you know, used or seen again. Zimmerman s auction is running on GunBroker.com, where bidding begins at $5,000   the price he is attaching to Trayvon Martin s life. In his posting, he says that he is  honored and humbled  to announce the sale of  the firearm that was used to defend my life and end the brutal attack from Trayvon Martin on 2/26/2012.  Zimmerman says that numerous people have offered to buy the gun, but that the prospective purchasers wanted to use the gun in a  fashion  that even he  did not feel comfortable with. He says the firearm is fully functional despite the efforts of  B. Hussein Obama to render the firearm inoperable,  noting that the purchaser may  do with the firearm what they wish. Zimmerman says that he will use the proceeds to fight against Black Lives Matter, to end the political career of the prosecutor who handled his murder trial, and to attack Hillary Clinton. Now is your opportunity to own a piece of American history,  he concludes.Asked what he thought about the opinions of those who would oppose the sale of the gun he used to kill a child, including Trayvon Martin s parents. Zimmerman explained that he doesn t care much: They re not going to be bidding on it so I couldn t care less about them.

        "title": " New Analysis Shows Black Neighborhoods Excluded From Amazon Same Day Delivery",
        "text": "A Bloomberg analysis of Amazon s same-day delivery service locations shows that Black neighborhoods are routinely excluded from access to the service.Although all customers pay the same $99 fee for the Amazon Prime membership, which includes same-day delivery service in covered areas, Black customers are significantly less likely to have access to that service.According to the Bloomberg study, Black customers who live in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Washington DC are 50 percent less likely to have access to same-day delivery.Bloomberg further reports:In New York City, same-day delivery is available throughout Manhattan, Staten Island, and Brooklyn, but not in the Bronx and some majority-black neighborhoods in Queens. In some cities, Amazon same-day delivery extends many miles into the surrounding suburbs but isn t available in some ZIP codes within the city limits.Out of all the places where Amazon same-day delivery services are available to Amazon Prime members, the analysis shows the greatest disparity in the city of Boston.According to the Bloomberg analysis: Three ZIP codes encompassing the primarily black neighborhood of Roxbury are excluded from same-day service, while the neighborhoods that surround it on all sides are eligible. In many cases this means that Black customers have no access to same-day delivery, while white customers, living just a few blocks away, do have access.Here s what the delivery zones look like in some of the most populated urban areas.Image credit: Screen capture Bloomberg.comAccording to Amazon vice president for global communications, Craig Berman, the company did not intentionally create a service area which excludes Black neighborhood.Berman says that service areas were determined by data and algorithms.As Tech Insider reports here, Amazon PR Director Scott Stanzel described the criteria the company used to generate the algorithm.According to Stanzel, that included  distance to the nearest fulfillment center, local demand in an area, numbers of Prime members in an area, as well as the ability of our various carrier partners to deliver up to 9:00 pm every single day, even Sunday. So how does a computer program which doesn t include race as a factor, generate a service area that excludes Black neighborhoods?Tech Insider sums it up best, by explaining:Racism, as researchers have documented in countless studies and reports, is the systemic marginalization of minority communities. It s the aggregate of small and large effects that make it harder for people to find housing, accumulate wealth, avoid the criminal justice system, and succeed in school if they aren t white. Data and algorithms selected in deliberate ignorance of racism can pick up and reinforce that systemic problem.So basically the algorithm reflects the racism that is already present in a service area. As described by Tech Insider, it  reflects ongoing economic disparities and segregation between white and black communities created by decades of redlining. That appears to be exactly what happened in the case of Amazon s same-day delivery service area coverage.Amazon says the company has plans to  fill in the gaps  in service coverage  over time. That doesn t seem like a good enough answer when the data shows that many Black customers are being denied equal service under the company s current model.Mistakes can happen, yes, but now that the problems have clearly been exposed, Amazon should take immediate steps to correct them.It s one thing to unknowingly generate an algorithm that excludes Black neighborhoods. It s another thing altogether to look the other way once you re aware of the issue. Image credit: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images",

Trump will enter the Oval Office with the worst approval rating in modern history for a president-elect.Only 45 of the limited-edition coins have been made.Image: screen capture via Associated Press. The man in charge of  Art-Grani,  spoke with the the Associated Press Television News and said the coins were designed to express his and other Russian business leaders   hopes associated with Trump. Vladimir Vasyukhin s company is about 650 miles east of Moscow, in south-central Russia s Chelyabinsk region. He said, there are more hopes associated with Trump with regards to the lifting of sanctions; maybe the environment (between the U.S. and Russia) will change. CBS reports:Mr. Trump even suggested in an interview with the Times of London several days ago that he might be willing to drop some of the sanctions against Moscow in exchange for an agreement on nuclear arms reduction. Moscow s reaction to the proposal was muted, and on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he didn t actually see it as a proposal from the incoming president.Five of the commemorative coins will be cast in silver and the others will be cast in gold.They measure almost five inches in diameter and weigh about two pounds each, similar to coins made by the company featuring Putin and other notable Russians.Watch:We re wondering when the president-elect s accent will start changing to Russian. Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader who is  very smart. Vasyukhin said the coins will sell for thousands of dollars and added that his company would like to give the first coin to Trump. Maybe Trump could use the coin to pay back some of the money he owes to Russian banks.Coincidentally, Ann Coulter authored a book titled,  In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!

        "title": " Anonymous GOP Reps Admit Clinton Will Win, Blame Trump\u2019s Stupidity",
        "text": "Republicans are already predicting doom and gloom for November. Since Donald Trump seems not to grasp what  get on message  means (they ve been telling him to do that for months), members of the Republican Party are already predicting Hillary Clinton as the victor.In an exclusive with The Hill, several members of the House GOP caucus under anonymity, who back Trump, now say they are preparing for a Clinton sweep in November.One  Southern lawmaker,  who is a Trump supporter, told the Hill:I m not feeling great about the immediate future of the conservative movement right now. As a conservative who believes our ideas are good for America, it is pretty gloomy these days.The southern lawmaker acknowledged Trump would be a difficult candidate to sell to the American people, considering the GOP s lack of a coalition with women, minorities, LGBT, and youth voters (yet they re still a Trump supporter), which means they don t care about the bran issues facing their party. There was some hope that the disaffected, so-called silent majority would be broad enough and turn out in large enough numbers to give Trump a chance. But if he continues the next 90 days like the last week, then he will lose big time,  the southern lawmaker told the Hill.One  Northeastern lawmaker  was more candid with his feelings:I think it will be Hillary. If I had to bet, I d definitely  bet that Trump loses. This is like a football game where you hate both teams. You root for a tie   and maybe some minor injuries.Right now, it sucks to be a Republican. Rep. Matt Salmon, who originally backed Marco Rubio, then Ted Cruz and now Trump, admitted a Trump win will be a  steep climb.  That s because the GOP didn t listen to their 2012 autopsy report, and they are paying the price. But not all members of the GOP are ignoring the findings from their last loss in 2012. Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania told the Hill that the GOP must learn from their autopsy report if they hope to win:Another autopsy will occur, and the next time I hope lessons will be learned.Fat chance that will happen. They seriously thought Romney was going to beat President Obama, and decided to disregard all the points they missed when he didn t win.The GOP is bracing for a Clinton win, and so is the rest of he country   anything is better than Donald Trump.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",

        "text": "After Donald Trump s first disastrous hot mic moment was revealed through an Access Hollywood audio tape, it was hard to believe that his presidency could be further soiled by another audio scandal   but all of that changed today.On Wednesday afternoon, Trump gave a commencement address to graduates at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, where he chose to complain about how unfairly he was treated compared to other presidents (some of which he seemed to forget were assassinated). It looked as if it couldn t possibly get any worse than Trump throwing a temper tantrum about the media instead of inspiring the graduating students   but that wasn t the only insanity that occurred.Apparently, Department of Homeland Security secretary John Kelly had no idea he was being recorded, because he got caught on a hot mic making a disgusting joke to Trump, and of course, Trump was laughing right along in agreement with him.During the ceremony, Trump was presented with a saber   another instrument that should never be placed in the hands of a man baby. Fortunately, no one was hurt. When Trump went back to his seat next to General Kerry, the DHS secretary leaned in and joked that Trump should use the ceremonial sword on reporters. In the recording below, you can see Kerry lean toward Trump and say,  You can use that on the press sir.  Trump giggled with glee and said,  Yeah, that s right.  It was an unbelievable moment that proved that there are children in the White House now:Gen. Kelly tells Pres. Trump  you can use that on the press  after he s presented with ceremonial saber at Coast Guard Academy commencement. pic.twitter.com/xj73oHxUdZ  ABC News (@ABC) May 17, 2017Trump and his team have made no secret that they all hate the mainstream media for its negative coverage, but this joke was absolutely disgusting.

        "title": " Thanks To Obamacare, America Will Save $2.6 Trillion In Healthcare Spending",
        "text": "As Obamacare continues to survive court challenge after court challenge (and the Republican s 50+ attempts at repealing), some good news about the landmark healthcare law comes today from the Urban Institute s Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.A new study conducted by the Foundation shows that healthcare spending in the United States, over a 5 year period, will be reduced by $2.6 trillion. The study was a correction to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which reported inaccurate spending predictions based on a flawed view of consumer spending and attributes of the landmark healthcare law:When CMS originally made those projections, they really thought the slowdown in health-care spending [growth] was mostly due to the recession, and afterward we d see a return to the higher rates of spending growth   and that didn t really happen.Although Obamacare isn t completely responsible for the slow in healthcare spending, the study does note that that the healthcare law and the  ripple effect  of its policies are having an effect with Medicaid and other programs that is causing more financial stability in the markets.The hospital readmissions program (which is covered by federal reimbursements) saw a sharp decline in these rates once Obamacare came into law, saving the country billions. That s just one example of how the healthcare law has been saving the government tons of money it otherwise would have been throwing away for frivolous expenditures.So, in other words, the process may be cyclical, but Obamacare is certainly speeding it up (or slowing down the costs, in this case).The Kaiser Foundation, in 2013, also came to the conclusion:The hangover from the Great Recession has had significant effects on consumer spending in general, and health spending specifically   [The Affordable Care Act] has clearly had a large and direct effect on slowing down health spending in Medicare. Its effect on the rest of the health system is somewhat more speculative, but I believe it s real.Only one thing is for absolute certain: Obamacare has no skyrocketed healthcare spending. It may not be the only thing slowing it, but it certainly isn t bloating the budget.So when Republicans scream that the healthcare law will add to the deficit, add to the debt, created a bloated budget, or anything else they want to throw out in the air, the should read this study.All the doom and gloom the GOP has peddled for the last six years has shown to be nothing but right-wing conspiracy talk, drummed up to instill fear in people who are scared of a  socialist  takeover of healthcare.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",

        "text": "21st Century Wire says This is a bit of an oddity as far as TED talks go Investigative journalist Trevor Aaronson actually delivers a TED presentation which calls out the FBI for being the party responsible for creating the majority of so-called  domestic terror  and  Islamic terror  busts in the US since 9/11.Just this week, the FBI are boasting of a high level domestic extremist terror bust of a militia group in Kansas, but when you read the fine print of the case, it features several FBI  confidential informants,  no doubt helping to  egg-on  and steer their prey into a preconceived trap.21WIRE has been saying this for years, and it s refreshing to see what is normally a bland, mainstream talking shop like TED actually allow a speaker to present a real anti-establishment subject like this one.In truth, the FBI s shady record in this area stretched back well before 9/11, when FBI informants (under FBI supervision) helped to organize the 1993 World Trade Center Bombing. Despite this, idiotic mainstream media and politicians in the US still claim that the 1993 WTC event was  linked to al Qaeda. NOTE: The following speaker Trevor Aaronson claims that both the Boston Bombing and the attempted Times Square car bombing. This statement is very likely to be incorrect. It has already been confirmed that the FBI s lead suspect in Boston, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was being active recruited by the FBI for at least two years prior to the event in question, as well as being associated with a CIA front org called the Jamestown Foundation. Similarly, the alleged Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad, appeared to have fled to Pakistan with a handler who has connections to the CIA and MI6. Otherwise, we welcome this topic raised by journalist Aaronson.Brasscheck TVGuess who is behind more terrorist incidents in the US than al-Qaeda, al-Shabaab and ISIS combined?The FBI   and when given the change to set the record straight, they don t dispute it.As  law enforcement  scams go, this is one of the most reprehensible. The FBI finds mentally ill people, puts ideas into their heads, works up plans for them and then gives them the money to carry them out   an then arrests them for terrorist plots.They then declare victory in the  war on terror. Domestic anti-terrorism efforts cost $100 billion a year or $1 trillion per decade.And you, your kids and grand kids pay for all this in the form of a reduced standard of living to make sure this useless anti-American scum get nice big paychecks and bloated tax-payer guaranteed pensions for their years of  service.

        "text": "After being found competent to stand trial following a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, Dylann Roof has decided to ditch his attorneys and represent himself in the Charleston Massacre trial.Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court in Charleston declared Roof competent to stand on Friday. Jury selection had been put on hold for three weeks after the defense team asked the judge to declare Roof incompetent due to mental defect. But a psychiatric evaluation found that Roof was able to assist in his defense and understood the consequences of the proceedings. Therefore, under the law, he was ruled competent.On Monday, things took a surprise turn when Roof petitioned the court to allow him to represent himself. Gergel advised Roof against firing his legal team, which is led by David I. Bruck, a noted capital defense attorney. The judge asked the defendant a series of questions to make sure he understood the ramifications of his actions. But ultimately, after having found Roof competent, Gergel had no choice but to honor Roof s Sixth Amendment right to act as his own attorney. I do find the defendant has the personal capacity to self-representation,  Judge Gergel said.  I continue to believe it is strategically unwise, but it is a decision you have the right to make. Although Roof will be taking the lead role in his defense, Brock and the rest of his legal team will continue to serve as standby counsel.  Jury selection has since resumed.Roof is accused of killing nine African American people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., on June 17, 2015. He reportedly mingled with his victims for an hour, sitting in on their bible study where they welcomed him with open arms. He then began shouting racial slurs and pulled out a Glock pistol from his fanny pack. He opened fire on his unsuspecting victims, killing the pastor of the church, three other ministers and five other members of the congregation.Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, warned of the troubles defendants face when they represent themselves, especially if they have a mental illness. Key issues never get raised because the defendant knows nothing about the law,  said Dunham.  And often with mentally ill defendants whose murders were a product of their mental illness, they will attempt to justify their conduct instead of presenting evidence that their mental illness makes them less culpable. Abraham Lincoln said,  He who represents himself has a fool for a client.  While that may be true, it can also be particularly traumatic for the family when a defendant accused of slaughtering their loved ones is acting as his own attorney, as Dunham explained. When an emotionally disturbed defendant is permitted to cross-examine those witnesses and ask questions that may be based on a delusional view of reality, it only makes things worse,  Mr. Dunham said.Featured image via Grace Beahm-Pool/Getty Images",

        "title": "\u201cI LIVE IN ABSURDISTAN\u201d: A Warning For America About Mass Migration [Video]",
        "text": "Ladies and gentlemen. My name is Ingrid Carlqvist and I was born in Sweden in 1960, when the Social Democrats were gonna rule forever and ever and our country was the nicest and safest and most progressed in the world. Now I live in Absurdistan   a country that has the highest figure of reported rapes in the world, hundreds of so called  exclusion areas  where people live outside the Swedish society and with newspapers that hide all these horrible facts [from] the people.I feel just like Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz   a tornado came and blew me miles and miles away from home and dumped me in a country I don t know. Toto, I have a feeling we re not in Sweden anymore. Like Dorothy I m searching for a way to find my home, but on my path I only meet lions without courage, scarecrows without brains and tin men without hearts.When I grew up our prime minister was Tage Erlander, a Social Democrat. In 1965 he said in parliament, after violent race riots in America: We Swedes live in a so infinitely happier situation. The population in our country is homogeneous, not just according to race but also in many other aspects. Now I live in a nation that is not homogenous in any respect. Olof Palme that came after him decided that homogeneous was a bad thing and opened up our borders for people from all over the world. And from right to left the politicians told us that there was no such thing as a Swedish culture, no Swedish traditions worth mentioning and that we Swedes should be grateful that so many people with REAL culture and REAL traditions came to us.Mona Sahlin, a later leader of the Social Democrats, said in an interview [in] 2002 with the magazine Euroturk, when asked what Swedish culture is:I ve often had that question, but I can t think of what Swedish culture is. I think that is what makes us Swedes so envious of immigrants. You have a culture, an identity, something that ties you together. What do we have? We have Midsummer s Eve and such corny things.She also said: The Swedes must integrate into the new Sweden. The old Sweden is not coming back.In this New Sweden we have more reported rapes than any other country in the European Union, according to a study by professor Liz Kelly from England. More than 5 000 rapes or attempted rapes were reported in 2008 (last year it was more than 6 000). In 2010 another study reported that just one country in the world has more rapes than Sweden, and that is Lesotho in South Africa. For every 100,000 inhabitants Lesotho has 92 reported rapes, Sweden has 53, The United States 29, Norway 20 and Denmark 7.In 1990 the authorities counted 3 exclusion areas in Sweden, suburbs where mostly immigrants live, where very few have a job to go to, almost all of them live by welfare and the children don t pass their exams. In 2002 they counted 128 exclusion areas. In 2006 we had 156 and then they stopped counting. In some cities, like Malm  where I live, a third of all inhabitants live in an exclusion area.What did Tage Erlander mean when he said that the Swedish population was homogeneous, not just according to race but also in many other aspects? I think he meant things like norms, values, culture and traditions. A feeling of fellowship. That we all, in the Old Sweden, had a similar view of what a good society is and how we solve conflicts. He KNEW what the Swedish culture was all about, in contrast to Mona Sahlin.In the New Sweden we need armed police officers at our hospitals because rivalling families fight each other in the hospital rooms. They gun each other down in open streets and they rob and beat old people up. The crime rate grows by the minute, but the Swedish politicians and journalists tell us that it has absolutely nothing to do with immigration. The fact that our prisons are full of foreign people is just a coincidence or is explained by socio-economic factors.For many years I was a journalist in the mainstream media. But I was always a bit of a troublemaker, always suspicious of what people said was THE TRUTH. When everybody ran in one direction, I turned around in the other direction to see what was there.In January 2011 something happened to make me loose my last hope about Swedish journalists. I was the vice chairman of The Society of Publicists in Malm  and had invited the Danish journalist Mikael Jalving to talk about his coming book  Absolute Sweden   a Journey in the Country of Silence.  One day the chairman phoned me and said: We must cancel Mikael Jalving because he is going to talk at a meeting arranged by a newspaper called National Today.It didn t matter to him, or to anyone else on the board of this society for journalists that Jalving was going to talk about his book. If he went to that meeting he would be infected by nationalist ideas and probably he would become a Nazi.You see, everyone with a different opinion in Sweden really IS a Nazi!That s the way it works in the New Sweden, the country I call Absurdistan. The country of silence.I was furious and left the board of that society. That led to my being invited to The Danish Free Press Society to talk about the strange country of Sweden and that led to my founding of The Swedish Free Press Society.That is how Lars Hedegaard and I found each other. But we didn t settle for running one Free Press Society each; since we both have a solid background as journalists we decided to start a newspaper. A good old, old-fashioned printed newspaper. We decided to call it Dispatch International because our vision is that this newspaper will become worldwide one day. But first we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin. Or rather   first we take Scandinavia and then we take the world!Dispatch will be printed in two versions   one Danish and one Swedish   but all the stories are the same. And on the internet you will be able to read our stories in English and German as well. We will write about politics in our countries and in the world. We will write about all those things that mainstream media have been hiding for so many years now. We will distinguish between news stories and commentaries and the tone will be subdued. We will let the facts talk, the facts that mainstream journalists hide from people.The situation in Sweden is far worse than in Denmark. In Sweden NOBODY talks about immigration problems, the death of the multiculti project or the Islamisation/Arabisation of Europe. If you do, you will immediately be called a racist, an Islamophobe or a Nazi. That is what I have been called since I founded the Free Press Society in Sweden. My name has been dragged through the dirt in big newspapers like Sydsvenskan, Svenska Dagbladet and even my own union paper, The Journalist.So now I need you all to be my Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, and help me find my home again! I don t think it will work to tap the heels of my ruby slippers together three times as Dorothy did to wake up in her bedroom in Kansas. But if you support Dispatch by taking a subscription or become a shareholder or just donate money to us, you will take me one step closer to home. To the Sweden that once was, the Sweden I want back.Via: Frontpage Magazine",

        "title": " Fact: Repealing Obamacare Will Absolutely Decimate Red State America",
        "text": "We hear a lot from Republicans about how they re going to repeal the  job killing,   healthcare killing,  big government law unofficially called Obamacare. These unsung heroes of the nation, almost all of them representing red state America, are going to free us and their states from the shackles of socialized medicine   or so they say.Should Republicans get their way, they will absolutely decimate their states  economies.According to the Economic Policy Institute, an American think tank in Washington, D.C.:Across the country, 29.8 million people would lose their health insurance if the Affordable Care Act were repealed more than doubling the number of people without health insurance. And 1.2 million jobs would be lost not just in health care but across the board.So not only will America overall be taken back to the dark ages of pre-Obamacare, red states will be hit the hardest. In terms of the increase in the uninsured rate per state, of the top 30 that will be hit hardest, 20 are red states that voted for Donald Trump.So how much will the uninsured rate increase with an Obamacare repeal? Here s the list (top 20) for Trump states:The blue states that would be most affected by the repeal would be Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Illinois, Oregon, and Washington.If Republicans think their town hall events are bad now, just wait until they see what the summer of 2017 will produce. Democrats got the brunt of it in 2011, now it s time for the GOP to reap what they ve sown.Leaked audio from the Republican retreat in Philadelphia showed that many GOPers were divided on whether to repeal or reform Obamacare. Many expressed concern with how their constituents would react if a full repeal were put in place. At the retreat, one Republican, Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, yelled: We re telling those people that we re not going to pull the rug out from under them, and if we do this too fast, we are in fact going to pull the rug out from under them. Rep. Virginia Foxx chastised MacArthur and other weary Republicans as  weak-kneed. Rep. MacArthur is correct in his fears: If Obamacare is repealed, and people lose their health insurance, Republicans are going to be cast as the enemy for pulling the rug out. And as the Economic Policy Institute showed, there are a lot of red-state Americans who will be affected.Given Trump s immense unpopularity, an Obamacare repeal would almost certainly hand the Democrats a House and Senate majority in 2018.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",

        "text": "More and more people have had just about enough of Donald Trump s ridiculous shenanigans. Trump has been racist, misogynistic, Islamophobic, and has catered to groups that hate LGBT equality. He s a person who has no right running for President of the United States, not only because of his bigoted views, but because he has absolutely no experience whatsoever.With Donald Trump being so scrutinized by so many, including the press that has the freedom to ask him questions and report what he says, Trump has taken action against the press. He s been prohibiting news organizations from attending his events. An action that goes directly against the freedom of press listed in the United States Constitution. The latest publication Trump has gone after is the Washington Post.Now, taking action against Trump in the same regard, is Late Night host Seth Meyers. On his latest show, Meyers brilliantly went after Trump for his reaction to the Orlando shooting, but also stated: As for the Washington Post, we here at Late Night believe in freedom of the press and therefore have decided to stand in solidarity with them. So as long as the Washington Post is banned from Donald Trump s campaign, Donald Trump will be banned from ever coming on this show. Good on you, Seth.

        "text": "The right-wing mom who forced her children to sing songs to the Bundy terrorists after they seized a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon experienced a revolt of her own when her children took away her guns and fled the house in search of help from law enforcement.The five kids escaped the home because they wanted the beatings they constantly endured to end.Authorities arrested Odalis Sharp on Friday for beating the children bloody with a rod in the name of God in what she called her way of leading them to Christianity. We need to turn to God, because the system is corrupt,  Sharp said before accusing the government of waging a vendetta against her.  They lie, they twist, they make false charges, they abuse people, and then they turn around and put people in prison, and then they accuse them of abuse. But it isn t the government accusing Sharp of abuse, it s her own children.They testified on Wednesday that their mother mercilessly abused them most days of the week by calling them names, forcing them to eat soap, and beating them bloody with a belt or rod as well as slapping them and hitting them in their private parts. They said it s typical to always receive some type of bruising and other times have bled from the swats,  a social worker told the court.  The children told me they were fearful. They did not want to return to their mother. The sheriff also described how one child told him that one of spankings  consisted of 47 swats,  and that after 27 spankings the abused child began bleeding. Sharp s 15-year-old son fled the home to escape constant beatings as well and Sharp explained it by saying the boy rejected  the right, wholesome and pure path in which I was leading him   in which God was leading us. And the kids don t have to go back to their mother either because the judge removed the children from Sharp s custody and placed them in the custody of the Kansas Department of Children and Families.Here s the video of Sharp s rant via YouTube.This is yet another case of how conservatives twist and use religion to excuse horrible acts. This woman dragged her kids to the center of a standoff between the FBI and a bunch of gun-toting right-wing terrorists and that s on top of the constant beatings they suffered at the hands of their mother who actually thinks she is doing God s work by bloodying up her kids.That probably makes televangelist Pat Robertson smile, but is hardly an acceptable way to treat children in modern society. If you have to resort to beating religion into kids, your religion is truly weak.Featured image via screenshot",

        "text": "The Imperial Presidency continues against the Constitution: The Constitution provides that the president  shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur  (Article II, section 2) White House: The president has the legal authority to ratify the accord without the two-thirds Senate vote required for treaties. The pact is merely an  executive agreement.  What they re not telling you is this  executive agreement  is a HUGE redistribution of American tax dollars to other countries!This should be voted on!For many years the public at large has been spoonfed the idea that Global Warming Climate Change, is caused by man s excessive release of carbon into the atmosphere. And that the solution to the Climate crisis was to decrease the production of said gas.Over the past several years the Global Warming fanatics have changed their tune. Many of us in the  new  media have been warning about their true motives for year.Now, instead of the climate crisis being caused by carbon emissions, it is being caused by inequality.On Monday, during a press conference at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, Ms. Camille Risler, a representative of the Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD) which is an organization listed as an official consultant to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, stated that the cause of Climate Change is the unequal distribution of wealth, carbon, and power: This is the press conference of the Women and (unintelligible) constituency. It is one of the nine official constituencies of the UNFCCC, and we are composed of 15 women s rights and feminist organizations from all around the world. So I m going to begin with kind of an overview of our positions and then I will give the floor over to my colleagues that will go more into details of each section of negotiations.I m Camille Risler. I m from France but I m living in Thailand. I m working for a feminist network that is called Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development and I m working for the Climate Justice Program.So what we want to highlight here is that Climate Change is a clear symptom of an unequal and unjust world.So if we are to address the Climate crisis we need to challenge the structural causes of the crisis which lies on unequal distribution of wealth, of carbon, and of power. Whether it s political power, economic power, or even military power. Ms. Risler goes on to say that the solution to the Climate crisis is to create more  just and equitable economies .Roughly translated that means an economy based along the lines of Socialism and Communism. Because now, according to the Climate preachers, nothing is more dangerous to the planet than a free market economy, individual free will, and inequality.

        "text": "Bernie Sanders should know his socialized medicine but in an exchange on Sunday he failed when he was pressed to explain why a single-payer health care system was rejected in Vermont and California, two staunchly Democratic states:CNN host Jake Tapper said that California and Vermont are  cobalt blue states  and asked how single-payer could be affordable at the national level if they rejected the system at the state level because of the expense:Single-payer failed to pass in both California and Vermont after lawmakers were unable to figure out how to fund the system. Voters in Colorado also rejected single-payer last year.Sanders pushed back against Tapper, citing  studies that he has seen,  and said that single-payer would save the average family  significant sums of money. If you look at Canada s single-payer health care system per capita, their costs are far far less than the United States,  Sanders said.   If you look at the UK, if you look at countries around the world, all of which have different approaches to a national health care system, in every instance, they are spending substantially less per capita than we pay in the United States.

In his testimony last week, former FBI Director James Comey said Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch asked him to call the Hillary Clinton probe a  matter,  not an investigation, but Mukasey said that s not breaking the law.

        "text": "Since Donald Trump began his run for the president, there has been one clear message: if you aren t white (preferably male) and Christian, you aren t a true American. Add that to the Tea Party, which started when Barack Obama was elected president (they didn t care about taxation enough to organize when there were white presidents), and we have a recipe for violence. In North Carolina, the Tea Party is threatening just that toward Muslims and the Trump administration, at least so far, is silent.About a third of Americans believe that if we let Muslim immigrants in, our country will be subjected to  Sharia law,  which is about the equivalent of Biblical law, which those Americans have no problem with. Sharia law, like Biblical law, would be a direct violation of the Constitution, but the only part they know of is the Second Amendment, which brings us to what these Tea Partiers want to do to Muslims they want to  kill the hell out of  them.The meeting was held in a North Carolina seafood restaurant and it included about two dozen Tea Partiers, many of whom are part of right-wing militia groups. Do you have any recommendations as to how we could stop this?  asked Frank del Valle, a Winston-Salem resident whose Facebook page identifies him as a retired federal employee and native of Cuba, near the end of the hourlong presentation.  Because my only recommendation is to start killing the hell out them. Source: Triad City BeatAccording to the group, they aren t the only ones: Political correctness is being thrown away,  he said.  A lot of people are meeting like this. We re making progress in the positive direction.  He argued for supporting reformers in the Muslim faith, adding,  We need to talk about how we can get things done peacefully. Be ready for the worst. I am beyond that point,  del Valle replied.  I m ready to start taking people out. That damned Sharia law is everywhere: The Muslim Brotherhood is behind all that terrorism and violent acts, but they re also here operating in America in a very stealthy mode,  he said.  They ve infiltrated the judiciary. They have judges that are elected to the bench. These judges are expected to make rulings from the bench here in America according to sharia law even though it s not a sharia court. If you ve got a Muslim judge he s required to try you under sharia law. These people are in high positions of influence often behind the scenes in government, academia, medicine, the media. How many of you have been to a hospital and seen the doctors that are running around in the hospital? Actually, judges are required to NOT try people under Sharia law and the vast majority of doctors are white, but the Tea Party has never been good with facts.These Tea Partiers are feeling empowered these days, for good reason. Trump has all but eliminated any references to right-wing terrorism, which is very real and already underreported. If Trump denounces right-wing extremism, he will be denouncing his most loyal base and that isn t going to happen.Featured image via Phillipp Guelland/Getty Images",

We are not banning Donald from the UK.And even if Trump were elected President, he wouldn t be able to ban Muslims from his shores   even if he wanted to.Ask yourself: how could he possibly make it work?America struggles to control its southern border as it is. It is not going to be able to change the global passport system and get your religion stamped on your passport or your head to establish your faith.What s the Christianity test going to be? Snurfling a hot dog whilst singing  Give me joy in my heart, keep me praising ? After a Muslim couple gunned down 14 residents of San Bernardino, California, Americans looked for strong leadership.

He speaks for millions of Americans.And who can blame them for not wanting to end up like us?https://t.co/5SaKwd02Hu  Katie Hopkins (@KTHopkins) December 9, 2015It took the President a couple of days to even admit the attack was terror and when he did finally address a nervous nation on Sunday night his tone-deaf message was that Muslims were their  friends, neighbours and sports heroes. In contrast, Trump IS providing leadership. He knows some of his grand-standing is hot air. But he is articulating a sentiment held by millions and reinforcing himself as a protector of the American people.It s the reason Trump is the Republican front runner. He has spent just $330,000 on broadcasting to Jeb Bush s $42.5 million  which is indicative of how much America is enthralled by this new voice.I hear cries that he is a blithering idiot. I have often been called a deranged fool. But if this were true you could ignore me, ignore us, imaging the two of us shouting naked at the rain.It s because we articulate sentiments repressed by the politically correct consensus that we have a voice.Trump said:  We have places in London so radicalised that police are afraid for their lives. Within moments the Met Police, Prime Minister David Cameron, and the clownish Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, jumped to defend the reputation of the UK and distance themselves from this glaring truth.Yet, at the time of writing, no less than five bobbies on the beat have come forward to confirm that there ARE estates where they will only patrol out of uniform.There is fear among the police AND the public.I work with a team of cameramen in town who text their wives and partners on the hour to confirm they are safe.My family is not keen for me to be in the capital.Some friends will no longer come to London.How do you feel about the security of the city s shopping centres right now, after what happened in Paris?I watch the BBC news, our national broadcaster, ramming home messages of inclusiveness.Today they gave platform to a representative of the Muslim community telling Trump he is an Islamophobe and is not welcome here.But that s not my voice. That is not the voice of a nation. All Brits don t think that way.Being force-fed multi-culturalism brought us to this place. When the only permitted message is acceptance, any views to the contrary result in a label to shame you into silence.Racist! Islamophobe! Nazi!Don t just stick a label it. Be curious. Wonder, how has Trump come to articulate the views of a majority of Republicans across the States?Because I don t buy into the clear divide between extremist Muslims and peaceful ones. I don t see these as two separate entities. It is a sliding scale, a spectrum. From utterly peaceful, to ambivalence to sympathising, to extremist, to a man blowing up buses in Woburn Place.It is the same slippery slope which sees regular mosque attendees from Luton slip off to Syria to join ISIS. And suddenly a tight knit Muslim community knows nothing.Not the local imam, not local families, no one. No one denouncing terrorism. Just a wall of silence. In our country.Hate hidden behind walls we are told to accept and tolerate because we are multi-cultural. Repeat after me. Multi-cultural.History teaches us lessons were refuse to learn.The IRA would not have enjoyed decades of success without many among the Northern Irish Catholic population acting just the same way as the imams and family and friends of extremists in Luton today.We have gone too far and lost control of vast swathes of our country. In part we ARE a radicalised nation and it does nobody any favours to deny the obvious.Trump wants to call a temporary halt to Muslim immigration until America figures out what is going on.Adversaries may be quick to jump on Trump and make him the problem.But look around. You are too busy gazing at the fluff in your navel to see the gangrene in your foot.You lost sight of terrifying.It isn t a big, brash American untroubled by the need to be loved. It is the march of ISIS and the so-called Islamic State.You may want to distance yourself from Trump.

        "title": "Robert Parry: US Intel Report on \u2018Russian Hack\u2019 Still Lacks Proof",
        "text": "Consortium News Exclusive: Despite mainstream media acceptance, the U.S. intelligence community s assessment on alleged Russian  hacking  still lacks hard public evidence, a case of  trust-us  by politicized spy agencies, writes Robert Parry.By Robert ParryRepeating an accusation over and over again is not evidence that the accused is guilty, no matter how much  confidence  the accuser asserts about the conclusion. Nor is it evidence just to suggest that someone has a motive for doing something. Many conspiracy theories are built on the notion of  cui bono    who benefits   without following up the supposed motive with facts.But that is essentially what the U.S. intelligence community has done regarding the dangerous accusation that Russian President Vladimir Putin orchestrated a covert information campaign to influence the outcome of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election in favor of Republican Donald Trump.Just a day after Director of National Intelligence James Clapper [image, left] vowed to go to the greatest possible lengths to supply the public with the evidence behind the accusations, his office released a 25-page report that contained no direct evidence that Russia delivered hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman John Podesta to WikiLeaks.The DNI report amounted to a compendium of reasons to suspect that Russia was the source of the information   built largely on the argument that Russia had a motive for doing so because of its disdain for Democratic nominee Clinton and the potential for friendlier relations with Republican nominee Trump.But the case, as presented, is one-sided and lacks any actual proof. Further, the continued use of the word  assesses    as in the U.S. intelligence community  assesses  that Russia is guilty   suggests that the underlying classified information also may be less than conclusive because, in intelligence-world-speak,  assesses  often means  guesses. The DNI report admits as much, saying,  Judgments are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be a fact. Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary, as well as logic, argumentation, and precedents. But the report s assessment is more than just a reasonable judgment based on a body of incomplete information. It is tendentious in that it only lays out the case for believing in Russia s guilt, not reasons for doubting that guilt.A Risky BetFor instance, while it is true that many Russian officials, including President Putin, considered Clinton to be a threat to worsen the already frayed relationship between the two nuclear superpowers, the report ignores the downside for Russia trying to interfere with the U.S. election campaign and then failing to stop Clinton, which looked like the most likely outcome until Election Night.If Russia had accessed the DNC and Podesta emails and slipped them to WikiLeaks for publication, Putin would have to think that the National Security Agency, with its exceptional ability to track electronic communications around the world, might well have detected the maneuver and would have informed Clinton.So, on top of Clinton s well-known hawkishness, Putin would have risked handing the expected incoming president a personal reason to take revenge on him and his country. Historically, Russia has been very circumspect in such situations, usually holding its intelligence collections for internal purposes only, not sharing them with the public.While it is conceivable that Putin decided to take this extraordinary risk in this case   despite the widely held view that Clinton was a shoo-in to defeat Trump   an objective report would have examined this counter argument for him not doing so.But the DNI report was not driven by a desire to be evenhanded; it is, in effect, a prosecutor s brief, albeit one that lacks any real evidence that the accused is guilty. Further undercutting the credibility of the DNI report is that it includes a seven-page appendix, dating from 2012, that is an argumentative attack on RT, the Russian government-backed television network, which is accused of portraying  the US electoral process as undemocratic. The proof for that accusation includes RT s articles on  voting machine vulnerabilities  although virtually every major U.S. news organizations has run similar stories, including some during the last campaign on the feasibility of Russia hacking into the actual voting process, something that even U.S. intelligence says didn t happen.The reports adds that further undermining Americans  faith in the U.S. democratic process, RT broadcast, hosted and advertised third-party candidate debates.  Apparently, the DNI s point is that showing Americans that there are choices beyond the two big parties is somehow seditious. The RT hosts asserted that the US two-party system does not represent the views of at least one-third of the population and is a  sham,  the report said. Yet, polls have shown that large numbers of Americans would prefer more choices than the usual two candidates and, indeed, most Western democracies have multiple parties, So, the implicit RT criticism of the U.S. political process is certainly not out of the ordinary.The report also takes RT to task for covering the Occupy Wall Street movement and for reporting on the environmental dangers from  fracking,  topics cited as further proof that the Russian government was using RT to weaken U.S. public support for Washington s policies (although, again, these are topics of genuine public interest).Behind the CurtainThough it s impossible for an average U.S. citizen to know precisely what the U.S. intelligence community may have in its secret files, some former NSA officials who are familiar with the agency s eavesdropping capabilities say Washington s lack of certainty suggests that the NSA does not possess such evidence.Binney, in an article co-written with former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, said,  With respect to the alleged interference by Russia and WikiLeaks in the U.S. election, it is a major mystery why U.S. intelligence feels it must rely on  circumstantial evidence,  when it has NSA s vacuum cleaner sucking up hard evidence galore. What we know of NSA s capabilities shows that the email disclosures were from leaking, not hacking. For instance, that s the view of William Binney, who retired as NSA s technical director of world military and geopolitical analysis and who created many of the collection systems still used by NSA.There is also the fact that both WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and one of his associates, former British Ambassador Craig Murray, have denied that the purloined emails came from the Russian government. Going further, Murray has suggested that there were two separate sources, the DNC material coming from a disgruntled Democrat and the Podesta emails coming from possibly a U.S. intelligence source, since the Podesta Group represents Saudi Arabia and other foreign governments Continue this article at Consortium NewsREAD MORE  RUSSIAN HACK  NEWS AT: 21WIRE Russia Files",

        "title": " HORRIBLE News For Do-Nothing GOP: Americans Support Paid Family Leave Across Political Lines",
        "text": "Republican lawmakers oppose paid family leave. But the majority of Americans say they support it, which is bad news for the GOP.As Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders vie for the Democratic nomination, one of their shared interests includes support of a federal law that mandates paid family leave.Paid family leave would allow workers to take time off to care for a newborn child or deal with any other family illnesses without having to worry about not getting a paycheck to take care of the bills.The Family and Medical Leave Act already requires employers to give workers 12 weeks of leave, but the only drawback is that the leave is unpaid, which means many workers can t afford to take that much time off if any at all. Paid leave would change that.Three states already have such a law on the books and other states are poised to follow suit. However, because Congress is controlled by Republicans, the effort to pass a federal mandatory paid leave law has gone nowhere because of GOP obstruction.But as the idea becomes more and more popular among Americans, Republicans may be forced to fall in line, and a new poll makes it clear that the GOP should start paying attention to what the people want.According to the Associated Press,An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll released Friday said 72 percent support paid family leave. Democrats were more likely to back it, but Republicans also expressed strong support. Overall, support was stronger among people age 40-64 and among women.Strong support among Republicans means that GOP lawmakers may have no choice but to throw their support behind the effort if they want to make their constituents happy.In Michigan, which is controlled by Republicans at the moment, Mary Jo Morelli says she supports paid family leave because  I feel that in the U.S., we need to realize that employees, or the workers, can t really do the best job possible if you are worrying about a family member. Pushing for paid family leave would put Republicans in a difficult spot since they would rick losing their corporate sponsorship if they side with workers on the issue. And if they chose to side with corporations, they risk being booted out of office by the voters, which means the issue has enough power to flip state legislatures into Democratic hands if enough voters are made aware of the campaign to enact paid family leave.The Associated Press reports that despite such a law existing in California about 44 percent had never heard of it. That means people in every state need to be educated about paid family leave and how it can benefit them so that the fight can be taken more seriously by lawmakers.Because a happier, healthier workforce is what is best for business and America.Featured Image: Pete Souza ",

Currently, the Donald is doing worse with minorities than even Mitt Romney did during his presidential run against Barack Obama, and his previous outreach efforts   telling African-Americans they are poor, uneducated, and have nothing to offer the world   as well as his tight connections with the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups are not doing him any favors.After Trump s embarrassing, scripted interview with a Detroit pastor was leaked, Trump knew he had to step it up.

CNN caught up with Carson after Trump left and asked him what was apparently a difficult question. We just saw Mr. Trump here and I asked him how did it go and he said  Great.  He said he learned a lot of things. What do you think he took away from today?  CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond asked.That s right   he asked Carson if Trump learned something from spending a few minutes around black people. This led Carson to have a  Rubio moment,  but with luggage rather than a water bottle. Carson s face twisted into a look of concern, then terror:Then he walked away, successfully avoiding the question.How did Donald Trump do during his visit? Not only was the church he visited virtually empty, but one woman who lives in Carson s childhood home told the Detroit Free Press that Trump s visit was clearly a photo-op. Her takeaway from his obvious and meaningless attempt to pander to the African-American community while offering nothing substantive is that people should  vote Democratic.

        "title": " Bundy Militant Files $666 BILLION Lawsuit Against Government For \u2018Damages From The Works Of The Devil\u2019",
        "text": "The moment the initial members of the Bundy militants were arrested, effectively ending the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, one thing was for certain: as paranoid, anti-government conspiracy theorists, these people could be counted on for some absolute batsh*t crazy legal defenses. But no one could anticipate the sheer stupidity of their other legal filings.Shawna Cox, the woman who falsely claimed that LaVoy Finicum was executed with his hands in the air when in actuality he was attempting to pull a gun on law enforcement, filed a lawsuit against the big, bad federal government. Cox is seeking a whopping $666,666,666,666.66 in damages because she says the government harmed her in performing  works of the devil    including her attempted execution.KATU reports that Cox, who managed to convince the court to do her a special favor in allowing her to attend Finicum s funeral, quickly found her lawsuit tossed out because her claims are not cognizable in this criminal proceeding and will not be addressed in this case. Cox maintains that she did not interfere with public employees when she and her friends undertook an armed occupation of the Refuge because  it was their choice not to come to work out of guilt,  that federal employees were  secretly extending the boundaries  of Malheur, and says that she is being  maliciously prosecuted by the State and Federal Bar Association members because they do not want to be held accountable for their subversive activities against the people of the United States of America. No one is safe from her wrath. Cox says she will be asking the jury to  render civil and criminal charges against  a number of  public officials,  including  All of the Oregon State Bar members, and public employees who were involved in the persecution, prosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective council involving the incarceration of the Hammonds, including each and every one of them who violated the separation of powers and held offices in the judiciary and / or legislative and /or executive branches at the same time,  anyone who interfered with the  militia s  attempt to form an illegal and unrecognized Grand Jury to prosecute public officials, and  all involved in the ambush that attempted to execute myself and others and executed LaVoy Finicum. She also says she wants charges against  all state, public, and federal officials involved in organizing and authorizing the ambush execution of myself and others including LaVoy Finicum  as well as  all of the state employees involved in the ambush that attempted to execute myself and others, and resulted in LaVoy Finicum s murder. Cox specifically names Judge Grasty, Senator Cliff Bentz, Harney County Prosecutor Tim Calhoun, Governor Kate Brown, U.S. prosecutors Dwight Holton, Kirk Engdall, Kelley Zusman, S. Amanda Marshall, Judge Hogan, and Judge Ann Aiken as well as  officials who committed crimes against the Hammond family and myself by omissions and misprision [sic] pf felony s [sic],  Sheriff David Ward and Special Agent Katherine Armstrong.She says she is seeking the $666 billion in damages because these individuals subjected her to  damages from the works of the devil. If this seems nuts to you, you re probably right. These armed and crazed individuals declared war on the federal government, openly, and have essentially received a slap on the wrist for their anti-government efforts.Words can not describe the insanity of this woman s claims, so read them for yourself.

        "title": " Republicans Just Added What They Hated The Most About Obamacare To Their Bill",
        "text": "For the years since the debate over the Affordable Care Act began, anti-government Republicans (is there another kind?) have been bitching about the individual mandate that required people to buy insurance.Now it s their turn to come up with an alternative, and while theirs will cover fewer people, their solution is to force everyone to buy it, regardless of whether they can afford the barely subsidized coverage.The addition, which was tacked onto the Republican healthcare bill on Monday, is somewhat different from the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which says that there would be a penalty for people who lack coverage for more than 63 days. In the GOP bill, it s even worse. People would be barred from coverage at all for six months if they have a 63 day gap.Republicans added this provision after economists and health policy experts convinced them that it would be unsustainable to not force people to purchase insurance.Health policy experts across the political spectrum had warned that the initial Senate bill s failure to include some penalty for going uninsured could cause a  death spiral  in which people go without health insurance while healthy and only buy it when they become sick. In that scenario, insurance premiums shoot up for everyone as insurance markets become flooded with customers who disproportionately require expensive treatments.Source: NBC NewsThe main difference between this and the Affordable Care Act, though, is that the cost of premiums are going to be much higher. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 22 million Americans stand to lose their healthcare coverage if the GOP bill becomes law.By and large, Republicans want to do away with the Medicaid expansion, which allowed poorer people access to insurance, often without paying anything. Everyone who makes under $48,000 a year receives subsidies to help pay for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Instead with Trumpcare, they want to offer those people a block grant, which would severely restrict medical spending. Instead of subsidies, there will be tax credits.Some who aren t receiving Medicaid or Medicare might see more affordable premiums, but that s only because the coverage will be so much less.Republicans have now chosen to take the most controversial portion of the Affordable Care Act and make it absolutely draconian. If you happen to be one of the 22 million who loses insurance, good luck getting it back.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",

        "title": " New Study PROVES It\u2019s Republicans Who Are To Blame For Slow Economy",
        "text": "When Donald Trump isn t busy insulting Gold Star families or inciting his followers to assassinate his presidential opponent, he spends a lot of time talking about the dreadful Obama economy   one in which, admittedly, growth is slow. A new study, though, shows that Trump is pointing his stumpy finger in the wrong direction. The blame lies squarely with his Republican party.The report was published by the Economic Policy Institute. It blames Republican austerity, not Democratic spending, for the fact that economic growth was just 1.2 percent during the second quarter, and frankly, it hasn t been spectacular for a long time. It s easy to blame the man in the White House, which is what Republicans do, but they are wrong.The EPI places the blame on 2011 s Republican budget cuts, fiscal austerity at the state and local levels, GOP states  refusal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Instead of cutting spending during the recovery from the Great Recession, we should have been spending more   specifically on infrastructure and on programs that help people.This economic recovery has been the slowest over the past four business cycles. For example, the employment recovery from the trough of the Great Recession to its pre-recession peak took 51 months. Following the recession in the 1980s, employment recovery took 11 months. In the early 1990s it took 23 months, and in the early 2000s it took 39 months.The US government would have had to spend an additional $1tn in 2015 alone to match the spending that followed the 1980s recession, Bivens said. While such spending might run up the US deficit   something Republicans in Congress are opposed to   it would also have led to  several years of full employment  and the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates.Source: The GuardianAnother problem is the low interest rates. During the recovery from the 80s recession, the interest rates started at 9.3 percent. Now, with interest rates approaching 0 percent, and have been for a long time, there s no place to move them.The study does place some blame on the Obama administration, though. He didn t make effective enough use of the bully pulpit.The Obama administration  could have made a louder and more consistent case that the slow recovery had concrete, identifiable roots in decisions made by the Congress,  Bivens wrote.  Had the Obama administration made such a powerful case for why austerity was hampering growth, it could have educated the public and potentially helped build support for more sensible policy the next time the United States faces a recession.

        "text": "The unaccomplished Chelsea Clinton, wife of unemployed and perpetually vacationing husband Marc Mezvinsky, and daughter of America s most famous grifters, Bill and Hillary Clinton, took to Twitter to criticize President Trump s ban on transgenders in the military. It s worth noting that the woman whose wedding was paid for by the  charitable  Clinton Foundation, has assumed a new role, as the self-assigned new Democrat leader. There s only one problem with Chelsea s criticism she neglected to mention her father s ban on any military member who dared to be honest about being gay.Apparently in a hypocritical liberal s world, it s okay to ban openly gay military members, but it s hateful and a violation of human rights to ban openly transexual members of our military. Who better to make a policy that forces thousands of troops to keep secrets about their sexual lifestyle than the impeached former President Bill Clinton right Chelsea?Yesterday, the Washington Post tweeted about the hit piece they did on Trump s transgender ban:Analysis: Trump s stance on LGBT rights has always been confusing https://t.co/tNaSKJ082u  Washington Post (@washingtonpost) July 26, 2017Chelsea replied:No. President Trump has consistently failed to support LGBT equal rights, dignity & safety in the U.S. & around world (e.g. Chechnya/Russia) https://t.co/nXY5uYjz4S  Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) July 26, 2017Don t Ask, Don t Tell (DADT), byname for the former official U.S. policy (1993 2011) regarding the service of homosexuals in the military. The term was coined after Pres. Bill Clinton in 1993 signed a law (consisting of statute, regulations, and policy memoranda) directing that military personnel  don t ask, don t tell, don t pursue, and don t harass.  When it went into effect on October 1, 1993, the policy theoretically lifted a ban on homosexual service that had been instituted during World War II, though in effect it continued a statutory ban.

Trump honored the police officers and special agents who took down the lunatic who shot Steve Scalise last month during a baseball practice for a charity game:Remember the horrible day that the lunatic opened fire trying to kill Republicans?Here s our report on the shooting:Rep. Steve Scalise was shot Wednesday morning in Alexandria, Virginia, in a  deliberate attack.  A congressional staffer was also shot. Scalise is in surgery right now and is expected to recover.Rand Paul said Scalise being there likely saved everyone because his presence meant Capitol Police were there.Scalise, a member of the House Republican leadership as the majority whip, appeared to have been shot in the hip and it appeared two Capitol Hill police agents were shot, according to Rep. Mo Brooks who was on deck when the shooting occurred. The shooting took place at a practice for the GOP congressional baseball team.NBC News Special Report: Congressman Scalise, aides shot at baseball practice in Virginia https://t.co/KD9i1iP9MZ  Jason Calabretta (@JasonCalabretta) June 14, 2017In a statement, Texas Rep. Roger Williams, one of the team s coaches, said one of his staff members was shot during the incident and is receiving medical attention. There was no information on the staffer s injuries.According to both congressional and law enforcement sources, the shooting appears to be a  deliberate attack. Two law enforcement sources say the suspect  is in police custody, has been taken to a hospital.Lawmakers who spoke at the scene to reporters described a normal morning practice, at a field where they ve practiced for years, when all of a sudden shots rang out. Lawmakers, staff members and even the young son of one of the members ran for cover, jumping into dugouts and over fences to avoid the gunshots.Congressmen in attendance described  an injured Scalise dragging himself roughly 15 yards away from second base and lying there until the shooter was shot. The Congressmen then ran to help him. Once they were able, Sen. Jeff Flake said he and Rep. Brad Wenstrup, who is a physician, went out to where Scalise was lying to apply pressure to the wound. Nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill police. It would have been a massacre without them.  -Rand Paul  We had nothing but baseball bats to fight back against a rifle with.    Congressman Mo BrooksArizona Sen. Jeff Flake added that he saw a member of Scalise s security detail return fire on the gunman for what felt like 10 minutes, even though the police officer was wounded in the leg.  50 shots would be an understatement, I m quite sure,  Flake said when asked about the total amount of gunfire, including police returning fire. Flake said two members of Scalise s security detail were wounded, and another man was wounded in the chest. Brooks said the shooter appeared to be a white male but added that  I saw him for a second or two.  He said the shooter was behind the third base dugout and didn t say anything.  The gun was a semiautomatic,  Brooks said, adding that he was sure it was a rifle but unsure what kind.  It continued to fire at different people.

Biden is leaving office one of the most popular political figures in America, and that popularity is even higher among Democrats. Biden is seen by many as a Democrat who excels at speaking to working class families across the racial spectrum, but still has a history of legislative experience as success as a Senator from Delaware and then as a two-term Vice President.Biden would likely be able to tap into existing Democratic donors if he ran, as he has near 100% name recognition domestically and internationally.

He did not mention his wife.District judges often provide the first ruling when laws are called into question, decisions that can put them at odds with the White House and its lawyers. Last month, for example, judges in Hawaii and Maryland temporarily blocked Mr. Trump s travel ban.Mr. Talley also did not mention his wife when he described his frequent contact with White House lawyers during the nomination process.Talley has also never tried a case in his life, making him even more unqualified to be a judge. In fact, the American Bar Association judged Tally as  unqualified  for the position in a very rare unanimous decision.The Senate could hold a confirmation vote as early as Monday, and it is important that they reject Talley, especially since he lied to them by omission.If Republicans confirm Talley, they will be telling future nominees that it s okay to lie to Congress in order to get an important job. That should not be allowed to happen. Trump and Republicans often claim that immigration should be based on merit.

NSA ReportHere s what we know about the woman who will be spending 15-20 years in prison for leaking:The Justice Department announced charges Monday against a federal contractor with Top Secret security clearance, after she allegedly leaked classified information to an online media outlet.Reality Leigh Winner, 25, a contractor with Pluribus International Corporation in Georgia, is accused of  removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet,  according to a federal complaint.REALITY WINNER S FACEBOOK PAGEThe document Winner allegedly leaked is the same one used as the basis for the article published Monday by The Intercept, detailing a classified National Security Agency memo. The NSA report, dated May 5, provides details of a 2016 Russian military intelligence cyberattack on a US voting software supplier, though there is no evidence that any votes were affected by the hack.A US official confirmed to CNN that The Intercept s document is a genuine, classified NSA document.US intelligence officials tell CNN that the information has not changed the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, which found:  Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards. DHS assesses that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying. Prosecutors say when confronted with the allegations, Winner admitted to intentionally leaking the classified document   and she was arrested June 3 in Augusta, Georgia.An internal audit revealed Winner was one of six people who printed the document, but the only one who had email contact with the news outlet, according to the complaint. It further states that the intelligence agency was subsequently contacted by the news outlet on May 30 regarding an upcoming story, saying it was in possession of what appeared to be a classified document.The Facebook page of Reality Winner is full of her exercising.

        "text": "It s interesting that Josh Earnest still carries around the line of bs that all middle class Americans know is a lie. He is, after all,  the chief propagandist for Obama so lying is what he does professionally. The truth is, Obama s presidency has been horrific for the middle class but great for the uber wealthy. Once again, they re counting on the American people to buy the line of bs and propaganda instead of looking at facts One moment of unintended   and unnoticed   levity occurred near the end of the White House briefing Tuesday, when White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest claimed that President Obama has been  a president of the United States that for the last six and a half years has scratched and clawed to protect the interests of middle-class families all across the country. Not sure about who or what he has scratched and clawed. Because the markings are difficult to discern.The White House is careful to dress up its policies as  middle class economics.  Because the middle class is where the votes are. But the Obama presidency is not about the middle class.You can agree or disagree with Obama s methods and policies. But his chief enthusiasm has been helping the lower classes by expanding the welfare state and regulating businesses. The middle class stuff is camouflage for the real agenda.The proof is in the pudding. Here s the pudding.According to Reuters:Barack Obama enters the final two years of his presidency with a blemish on his legacy that looks impossible to erase: the decline of the middle class he has promised to rescue.Federal Reserve survey data show families in the middle fifth of the income scale now earn less and their net worth is lower than when Obama took office. In the six years through 2013, over the recession and recovery that have spanned Obama s tenure, jobs have been added at the top and bottom of the wage scale, a Reuters analysis of labor statistics shows. In the middle, the economy has shed positions   whether in traditional trades like machining or electrical work, white-collar jobs in human resources, or technical ones like computer operators.Between 2010 and 2013, as recovery took hold and stock markets soared, the average net worth of families in the top 40 percent of income earners grew. For all others average net worth shrank, declining 19 percent for the middle fifth.These results stem from specific policies. Obama s chief domestic initiative, Obamacare, is not a middle class program. It s an effort to get health insurance to the lower class, including a massive expansion of Medicaid. Expanding health insurance is a good goal, but the way he has done it involves turning insurers effectively into wards of the state and raising the price and lowering the quality of healthcare for everyone else.Among his other battle cries are raising the minimum wage and legalizing illegal immigrants. He pushed and signed legislation containing massive new regulations on the banks, wants to regulate carbon emissions by fiat, and has enlarged the government s share of the economy while running up trillions in debt.Meantime the WEALTHY have benefited during Obama s tenure for the zero-interest rate Fed policies needed to keep the economy afloat in the absence of any serious presidential leadership on expanding the economy. The low rates have grandly goosed everyone s stock portfolios and made the rich richer.These things he scratches and claws for. Not private sector expansion and business-friendly policies that would promote middle class expansion.And the results speak for themselves.Via: White House Dossier",

        "text": " The View  co-host, and rabid, liberal, activist, Joy Behar, made a colossal ass of herself on Friday when she was handed a breaking news story in the middle of her show. Joy Behar paused the show to read the  breaking news  statement aloud to her viewers:  ABC News  Brian Ross is reporting Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Mueller team, and is prepared to testify that as a candidate,  Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians! Yes!  Joy proceeded to throw her hands in the air and toss the card containing what ended up being a fake news story, into the air, as a sign of her jubilation over the news that they finally  got  Donald Trump. Joy was not only telling her audience something that wasn t true, she was showing what it looks like when a partisan hack puts their own selfish desires above a potentially serious issue that, if it were found to be true, could potentially be a serious national security issue.Watch:joy behar getting handed the flynn news is the definition of, well, joy pic.twitter.com/Ush7sH5K3r  David Mack (@davidmackau) December 1, 2017Meghan McCain, who was clearly disturbed by her co-host Joy Behar s unprofessional behavior on Friday, gave Behar,  and the rest of the liberal The View panel a piece of her mind on the show today.Watch:The funniest and most delusional part of the video happens when fellow unhinged, liberal, activists and co-hosts of The View attempt to convince their viewers how Hillary could never get away with half of the things Donald Trump has done. EW- When it happened in real time, I think everyone who was watching the show could see my discomfort at the room erupting like the Dodgers had just won the World Series,  she said when the topic of the correction was first brought up. She then compared Behar s initial reaction to that of Rush Limbaugh saying that he hoped Barack Obama would fail as president. McCain explained,  If we re celebrating a breach of national security   it s going to tear our country apart. McCain then lambasted her co-hosts for spreading  fake news  with her on the panel.  I went to a Christmas party over the weekend; it s no secret, most of my friends are in conservative media, [and] I feel a lot like I m an astronaut from another planet to come here to try to explain both worlds to each other   that s how different I feel on this show sometimes,  she said.  And I will say that fake news, and what we did on Friday, that s what I was accused of being a part of. McCain is a conservative who has criticized Trump in the past. The daughter of Senator John McCain, she departed her brief stint as a Fox News host and contributor in September before officially joining The View the next month. On both Friday and Monday, she was joined on the panel by recurring panelist Ana Navarro, the anti-Trump Republican commentator who voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Behar, who first broke the erroneous Trump-Flynn information on The View after being handed a card featuring Ross  reporting, is an outspoken Democrat.Ross has been suspended by ABC for four weeks, a decision the reporter publicly supported.

The group claims it helps raise funds for the needy and provide food and shelter for activists.But according to a police report obtained by TheDC, the 33-year-old Wade was raising money in more explicit ways.He was arrested on April 25 at a motel where he resided in College Park, Md. Police say he was using the motel room to pimp a 17-year-old girl.He s charged with seven counts, including felonies for human trafficking. The charges carry sentences of up to 25 years in prison and a $15,000 fine. Wade posted $25,000 bond and left jail on April 27.Wade denied the allegations in an email to The Daily Caller. Formerly a stylist for Solange Knowles, the sister of Beyonce, Wade has been featured in numerous news articles about the Black Lives Matter movement. He was also invited by the White House earlier this week to a movie screening with other Black Lives Matter activists. Wade says he did not attend the function, which was on Tuesday.Last year, a team of Washington Post reporters, including Pulitzer Prize-winner Wesley Lowery, included Wade in a profile of Black Lives Matter activists who protested after the August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Mo. police officer Darren Wilson. According to the police report, an undercover officer with the vice intelligence unit responded to an ad on backpage.com, a website frequently used by sex traffickers and prostitutes. Holla at me. Quick stay specials tonight and tomorrow. Independent. Fun and sexy. Text me to set up an appointment???????  reads the ad, which listed the age of the poster as 23.The undercover detective contacted the poster to set up a meeting. The respondent informed him that the cost of services would be $100 for a half-hour and provided an address, which turned out to be a Howard Johnson Inn in College Park. A room number was also provided.When the undercover john arrived, a white female wearing only a towel answered the door and let him inside the room. After she attempted to initiate contact with the detective he informed her he was a police officer, and she ran out of the room. Members of the Vice Intelligence Unit described a male that was watching the Undercover Detective as he entered [room 412],  the report reads.Investigators reported that the teenager, who gave her age as 17, said that Wade was her  manager.  She called him  CJ. Wade, who used a passport to rent the Howard Johnson Inn room, was arrested and charged with sex trafficking. Police recovered three cell phones from him.The alleged victim told investigators that Wade knew she was a minor. She said that he told her he was not concerned about her age because  you only have 5 months left until you re 18 so I m not worried. She also told investigators that she provided all the money she was paid to Wade.In response to TheDC s request for comment, Wade claimed that a tenant at a temporary housing facility he was running as part of his charity  was involved in activities  that he did not know about. As this is a legal matter, I m not going into serious detail with you,  he said.He did claim, however, that he was unfairly arrested because he was  too trusting. Despite those claims, the police report suggests that there is evidence that Wade was the person who communicated with the undercover detective by text message.Wade issued a statement on Twitter after being contacted by TheDC in which he blamed conservative  trolls  for focusing on the case. He also said  I am confident that I will be cleared of the charges I am currently facing. I was forced to make this statement before I was ready to because of ongoing efforts by Twitter  trolls  to stop my work and the work of my organization,  he wrote. For the past two to three days,  trolls  have been actively baiting conservative news outlets to report on my arrest, amongst other vindictive things that they are actively working on. Wade also stated that the recent arrest is the second time he has been arrested after  helping someone else.  He did not provide details of the case, but a review of criminal databases shows he was charged with 3rd degree grand theft in Miami in January. Wade says he was not convicted in the case nor did he take a plea deal. Records show that the case was closed in February.Wade was also arrested in August 2014 in Travis County, Tex. and charged with making false statements.For entire story: Daily Caller ",

        "text": "Immediately after Donald Trump won the election, Americans saw a rise in harassment and hate crimes at the hands of his angry, privileged supporters. Unfortunately, these bigotry-fueled attacks haven t died down since the post-election chaos, and Trump supporters are still leaving their mark on this country in the most vile of ways.Recently, a white Trump supporter in Florida was charged with battery for attacking a Hispanic man. As if that wasn t disturbing enough, the man personally dedicated the attack to his President-elect, putting into perspective just how dangerous Trump s divisive campaign rhetoric was.According to the police report, Caleb Joseph Illig drove into the parking lot at a Gate Food Post store in Gainsville at around 1:10 a.m. The victim, Pablo Echevarria, had been cleaning the parking lot when he was brutally attacked by Illig, who shouted  Let s Trump down  as he started punching Echevarria in the back of the head. When Echevarria asked Illig why he was being attacked, Illig uttered these terrifying words: This is for Donald Trump. According to the charging document, Echevarria didn t fight back and instead tried to prevent further injury by using  evasive movements. Echevarria was rescued from further attack when another employee got involved and Illig fled. After the attack, Echevarria told police that he was experiencing pain in the back of his head and neck, although it is not clear if he was treated for these injuries.When police checked the security cameras to check Echevarria s claims, they found that the footage clearly shows [Illig] striking [Echevarria] in the back of the head, and completely corroborates the [victim] and [witness ] accounts of the incident. When Illig was confronted about the incident, he told police officers that he had no recollection of the incident whatsoever  and tried to blame his disgusting behavior on a mental disorder and alcohol. He has only been charged with simple battery.Noting that this was a politically-motivated hate crime, Officer Ben Tobias commented on the effects of the election on the community: Just looking at election results, the community is divided almost 50/50. It s not just here in Gainesville. I d like to think we re doing better, but we re having our own problems crop up. People like Illig are everywhere now, and they re not afraid to be openly racist now that Trump has given them their voice. This is what Trump meant by  Make America Great Again , and it is terrifying.Featured image via Facebook",

The shooting death and questions over the use of deadly police force against people of color sparked protests that roiled the city. We are black people and we shouldn t have to feel like this. We shouldn t have to protest because y all are treating us wrong,  the girl said Monday.  We do this because we need to and have rights. In a later interview with NBC, Oliphant said the emotion of the issue hit her as she spoke, and that s why she began crying.Her mother, Precious Oliphant, pointed out that Zianna and Marquis are involved in a police youth league and have frequently been around police officers in a positive fashion. But they are still aware of the problems of discrimination and racism at a very young age because as their mother she has been frequently pulled over for police for what she believes are trivial issues, like the way she wore her hair.Zianna says she plans to become a doctor when she grows up, and speaking up as she did, she is obviously well on her way to being a community leader. Others around her and in positions of leadership and authority in her community could do far worse than to follow her example, as she is clearly wise beyond her actual years.Featured image via screen capture",

        "text": "Milton Parker, a former paraprofessional (like a teacher but not quite) from New York, is currently defending punching an 11-year-old autistic student so hard that the child suffered a concussion. His defense? It was a  reflexive action. That might fly if Parker was facing an adult but he was facing an 11-year-old sitting in the cafeteria of PS 225, located in Brooklyn.Here s the disturbing video:The parents of the student are suing Parker for $5 million because they say their son is now afraid to go into school buildings and has to be homeschooled. As the parent of an autistic child, I can attest that one horrible incident can leave that kind of impact and as the parent of a non-autistic child as well, I can attest that it s MUCH harder for an autistic child to get over a traumatic incident. Finally, I can fully attest that if a teacher hit my son like that, they d be lucky if I stopped at a  concussion. After punching the child, Parker was charged with felony assault (but plead down to misdemeanor assault) and put in for retirement (perhaps sensing that he had become a danger to children?) but maintains he did nothing wrong:Milton Parker, who is being sued along with the city by the parents of Anatoly Veltman, said the blow he delivered was a  reflex  act in response to the boy hitting him first. Who gets hit and doesn t respond?  Parker told The Daily News.  The kid punched me in the eye first and as a reflex he got hit back. I knew it was on camera,  Parker, 59, said.  If it was intentional, I would have taken him to another room and beaten the snot out of him. Perhaps Parker is mistaking  in anger  for  as a reflex ? Because we ve all seen people lash out as a startled reflex followed by immediate remorse and concern for the person they hit. Watching that video, his body language is less  Oh crap! I m sorry!  and more  Yeah, you had that coming, punk!

        "text": "Lawless, Crooked Hillary promises to continue with Obama s arrogant, lawless push to flood America with people who have illegally entered our nation Democrat voters. Our nation and our nation s security won t survive another four years of Obama h/t to the brilliant Jon Feere, Legal Policy Analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies.  The CIS is one of the best sources in America for keeping up with our immigration crisis in America. From Hillary s website:Hillary will:Enact comprehensive immigration reform to create a pathway to citizenship, keep families together, and enable millions of workers to come out of the shadows.Defend President Obama s executive actions to provide deportation relief for DREAMers and parents of Americans and lawful residents, and extend those actions to additional persons with sympathetic cases if Congress refuses to act.Promote naturalization and support immigrant integration. End family detention and close private immigrant detention centers.Hillary s not just advocating for making lawbreakers legal citizens of the United States, she s also planning to bring millions of Muslims from countries who hate us to America, and fast-track them to citizenship:If elected president, Hillary Clinton could permanently resettle close to one million Muslim migrants during the first term of her presidency alone, according to the latest available data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).Between 2001 and 2013, the U.S. permanently resettled 1.5 million Muslim migrants on green cards. However, under Hillary Clinton s stated proposals, Muslim immigration would grow substantially faster, adding nearly one million Muslim migrants to the U.S. during her first term alone.Based on the most recent available DHS data, the U.S. permanently resettled roughly 149,000 migrants from predominantly Muslim countries on green cards in 2014. Yet Clinton has said that, as President, she would expand Muslim migration by importing an additional 65,000 Syrian refugees into the United States during the course of a single fiscal year. Clinton has made no indication that she would limit her proposed Syrian refugee program to one year.Clinton s Syrian refugees would come on top of the tens of thousands of refugees the U.S. already admits from Muslim countries.Adding Clinton s 65,000 Syrian refugees to the approximately 149,000 Muslim migrants the U.S. resettled on green cards in the course of one year, means that Clinton could permanently resettle roughly 214,000 Muslim migrants in her first year as President. If Clinton were to continue her Syrian refugee program throughout her Presidency, she could potentially resettle as many as 856,000 during her first term alone.Analysis from the Senate Immigration Subcommittee found that Clinton s plan to expand refugee resettlement could cost U.S. taxpayers over $400 billion.Additionally, once Clinton s Syrian refugees are in the U.S. as green card holders, they will have the ability to bring over their family members through chain migration.With regards to Middle Eastern migration, Clinton s 65,000 Syrian refugees would be added on top of the roughly 96,000 Middle Eastern migrants the U.S. resettled on green cards in a single year. Based on the minimum numbers Clinton has put forth thus far, as President, she could potentially resettle approximately 644,000 Middle Eastern migrants during her first term alone.According to a September 2015 Rasmussen survey, women voters oppose Clinton s Middle Eastern refugee plan by a remarkable 21-to-1 margin. Democrat voters oppose Clinton s refugee plan by a 17-to-1 margin. Most remarkably, 85 percent of black voters oppose Clinton s refugee agenda  with less than one percent of black voters supporting her plan.Yet Clinton s expansion to Muslim migration would be in addition to her expansion for immigration overall.U.S. Census data shows that if a President Hillary Clinton were successful in passing a Gang of Eight-style immigration expansion bill, the U.S. could permanently resettle roughly 9.4 million migrants throughout the nation during her first term alone. This figure does not include the additional 11 million illegal immigrants already here to whom Clinton has promised amnesty and U.S. citizenship.Clinton s desire to expand immigration is shared by GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan, who leads the pro-Islamic migration wing of the Republican Party.

        "title": "BREAKING BOMBSHELL: State Department Busted In Cover Up Regarding Hillary\u2019s Server",
        "text": "They knew! Can you believe these people? FOX News reported earlier that the release of this report was delayed twice today. Now we know why they released it late. These people are sickening! Please never forget these American heroes left to die by this woman. The U.S. State Department told a watchdog group in 2013 that it didn t have any information about former secretary Hillary Clinton s emails, even though  dozens of senior officials  knew she was using a private server for all her electronic communications.A report released Thursday by the agency s inspector general   a powerful and impartial internal investigator   described a cavalier culture about transparency inside Clinton s agency, saying that 177 requests for documents about Clinton are still  pending  nearly three years after she left office. The Freedom of Information Act requires federal agencies to respond to requests for information within 20 business days. The botched FOIA request, filed in December 2012 just before Clinton left office, specifically asked whether or not Clinton used an email account other than one hosted at state.gov. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal group, was reacting to news that former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa Jackson had used an alias    Richard Windsor    to send and receive emails in a way that couldn t be tied to her when FOIA requests came in. In May 2013 the State Department responded to CREW s request, saying it had  no records  related to what the group asked for. By then, Clinton had spent four years emailing department employees from her private home-brew account, but had never turned the messages over to the State Department. That CREW request was filed in December 2012, just before Mrs. Clinton left office, and specifically asked whether Mrs. Clinton used anon-State.gov email account for government business.  At the time the request was received, dozens of senior officials throughout the Department, including members of Secretary Clinton s immediate staff, exchanged emails with the Secretary using the personal accounts she used to conduct official business,  the Office of Inspector General concluded.  OIG found evidence that the Secretary s then-Chief of Staff was informed of the request at the time it was received and subsequently tasked staff to follow up. However, OIG found no evidence to indicate that any of these senior officials reviewed the search results or approved the response to CREW.  The employees responsible for searching the State Department s records, the report says, never  searched any email records, even though the request clearly encompassed emails.  State has received an unprecedented crush of requests for Clinton-related documents   240 in all, a number bigger than those related to secretaries Madeline Albright, Colin Powell, Condoleeza Rice and John Kerry combined. But the inspector general found that the agency cut the number of people processing those FOIA requests as they poured in. Clinton s emails sat on her private server for years until the State Department asked her in 2014 to turn them over. She deleted more than half of the messages, calling them  personal  in nature, before complying. In the meantime, however, her emails were out of reach when federal employees searched for records that might satisfy FOIA requests.Read more: Daily Mail",

        "text": "Donald Trump has singled out many people during his campaign, but none have remained a target in Trump s eyes and Twitter feed quite like Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.Trump s issue with Kelly exploded after the first Republican debate, when Kelly understandably called Trump out on his long-winded history of sexist, misogynistic comments toward women. Trump, being the abrasive a**hole that he is, blew the incident way out of proportion and continued to slam Kelly both on and off Twitter for weeks after the debate. Now Kelly is speaking out against Trump, claiming that the business mogul had actually tried to  woo  her in some incredibly creepy ways   which may have influenced why he was so bitter when she called him out.Vanity FairThis month Kelly graces the cover of Vanity Fair magazine, in which the 45-year-old journalist spoke about her interactions with The Donald at length. Kelly said that Trump used to send her press clippings that were signed  Donald Trump , and called her numerous times to tell her how much he enjoyed certain segments of her show (ironically, after the debate Trump criticized Kelly s show extensively). Kelly didn t think much of this at first, but when Trump announced he was going to run for president, Kelly said  it became more clear. But, Kelly said that Trump s efforts were completely futile. She said: I can t be wooed. I was never going to love him, and I was never going to hate him. I would have crawled over a pile of hot coals to make it to that debate. No one was going to be sitting in for me, reading my questions. And I can say with confidence that neither Bret nor Chris wanted to read my questions   for many reasons! Kelly revealed that her decision to focus on Trump s sexist remarks was because she knew Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton would zero in on them if they faced each other in the general election. Part of what Kelly said to Trump was: Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about womens  looks. You once told a contestant on celebrity apprentice that it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees.Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president? And how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton   who is likely to be the Democratic nominee   that you are a part of the war on women? It was one of the most reported moments from the debate, and Kelly received attacks from both Trump AND his loyal followers for holding him accountable. Trump lovers sent her death threats, called her a c t  and a  hag  on social media   even Trump s top deputy retweeted  gut her. Trump was especially immature about the situation, and he took his disdain for being confronted to new heights when he told CNN s Don Lemon that Kelly had  blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her   wherever.  Then, the Republican frontrunner threatened to boycott Fox and continued to diss Kelly for weeks after the debate   only further proving her point about Trump s misogyny.Featured image via Vanity Fair",

        "text": "An Ohio judge ruled that Ronald Ritchie, the man whose 911 call led to the officer-involved shooting of a Black man in an Ohio Walmart store in 2014, can be charged with making a false alarm.In August 2014, 22-year-old John Crawford was shot at least ten times by police, as he shopped for an air gun inside a Beavercreek, Ohio Walmart.Police arrived at the store in response to calls placed by Ronald Ritchie and his wife.During his 911 call, Ritchie claimed that John Crawford had a gun and that he was using it to threaten people.Video evidence showed that John Crawford had picked up the air gun in another part of the store, likely to purchase it.While Ritchie told the 911 operator that John Crawford was pointing the gun at customers, and at one point stated he was aiming it at children, after reviewing the video the judge determined Ritchie s statements were not true.As the AP reports here, the judge specifically noted in her statement: at the time that Ronald Ritchie is relaying to dispatch that Mr. Crawford is pointing the gun at two children, the video does not depict this event. As Addicting reported in August 2014, questions about Ronald and April Ritchie s 911 calls arose almost immediately after the 911 recordings were were released to the public.Ritchie was interviewed immediately following the death of John Crawford. Watch the video from WHIO.Less than 30 days after he told the 911 operator that John Crawford was threatening people inside the store with a gun, he retracted those statements, telling reporters  at no point did he shoulder the rifle and point it at somebody. Contrary to Ritchie s statements, video footage shows that Crawford was using the air gun to prop himself up, leaning on it as he did his shopping. He was talking with his girlfriend on the phone when a group of white officers shouted at him to drop the gun, then immediately opened fire, shooting him multiple times in the back.His last words were  It s not real. The judge ruled that Ritchie cannot be charged with inciting violence, including panic, involuntary manslaughter or reckless homicide, all charges that the court was asked to consider.Ritchie can face charges of making a false alarm, however   a crime for which he could serve six months in jail and pay fines of up to $1000.

        "text": "Whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty? The government bullies are playing judge, jury and executioner when they take assets in civil forfeiture. Policing for profit Mark Brewer is a decorated Air Force veteran who fought in the global war on terror. But last month, he became a casualty in the drug war.In late March, the U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the federal government could take more than $60,000 of Brewer s cash with civil forfeiture, even though he was never charged with a crime. The decision lets many Midwestern states continue to take property from people who have done nothing wrong.A former military police officer and weapons specialist, Brewer earned several medals during his service in the Air Force, before he was medically discharged in 2008. Brewer said he developed Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after a deployment in Afghanistan.In November 2011, Brewer was driving on Interstate 80 in Nebraska, when Douglas County Sheriff s Deputy Dave Wintle pulled Brewer over for crossing traffic lanes without signaling. During the stop, Wintle performed a criminal background check, which  revealed no major violations. After gaining Brewer s consent, Wintle walked around the car with a canine unit; the dog alerted to the trunk. When he searched the trunk, Wintle found two backpacks that had a  strong odor of raw marijuana  and $63,530 in cash.Brewer said he was travelling to Los Angles to visit his uncle and planned to use the money as a down payment for a house. According to Brewer, he had been saving that cash during his military service and from disability payments. Wintle did not believe his story, so Brewer s cash was seized and his car was towed. At the Douglas County Sheriff s Office, a later search  located disability documents, old paystubs and tax returns in the vehicle, along with two articles entitled  How to Make Wicked Hash  and  How to Make Weed Oil Without Blowing Yourself Up. But deputies never found any drugs in the car. Nor did the government ever charge Brewer with a crime. Deputy Wintle didn t even issue Brewer a traffic citation the basis for the stop.Read more: Forbes",

        "text": "Daily Caller   The revelation on Monday that former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos has plead guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian operatives thrust the little-known energy consultant into the national spotlight.Few details have been reported about the 30-year-old Papadopoulos, including how he ended up on the Trump campaign.Gateway Pundit reports that Papadopoulos was a volunteer whose repeated attempts to set up meetings between Trump s camp and Russians were outright rejected.The Washington Post reported back in August that Papadopoulos attempted to set up several meetings with Russia and all were rejected by Trump s camp.Watch Sarah Huckabee Sanders break down the difference between a Trump volunteer and Hillary and the DNC, who all of a sudden seems to have a renewed interest in Russian collusion again, after ignoring the bombshell revelation that Hillary and the DNC paid millions of dollars to create a phony Trump-Russia dossier. Sanders tells CBS News  Major Garrett,  The big difference here is you have a meeting that took place versus millions of dollars being sent to create fake information to actually influence the election. You compare those two, those are apples and oranges.What the Clinton campaign did, what the DNC did, was actually exchange money. They took a meeting. Those are far different. And one is pretty common practice in any campaign   to take a meeting. The other one is actually paying money for false information. That s a big deal and a big difference.

Campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis wrote that he thought NATO allies should be consulted before any plans were made. Another Trump adviser, retired Navy Rear Adm. Charles Kubic, cited legal concerns, including a possible violation of U.S. sanctions against Russia and of the Logan Act, which prohibits U.S. citizens from unauthorized negotiation with foreign governments.The NY Daily News even reported that Manafort put the kibosh on the Russia meetings as well. We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips,  Manafort told his business partner Rick Gates, an account his spokesman Jason Maloni confirmed to the Daily News Monday evening.The Gateway Pundit also reported that Papadopoulos was looking for a book deal just a few weeks ago.According to a screen shot of Papadopoulos s Facebook page tweeted by Guardian UK reporter Jon Swaine, the former aide sought book publisher recommendations three weeks ago. Interested in meeting with a prominent publisher. Recommendations welcome,   wrote Papadopoulos.Meanwhile Hillary s camp paid MILLIONS of dollars for a Russian dossier, a fraudulent document that most likely prompted a FISA warrant and ultimately led to the unmasking of Trump and his associates.

        "title": " Woman Publicly Disowns Her Parents After She Finds Out Her Mom Is A Trump Troll",
        "text": "Disowning your parents is an incredibly painful thing to do. These are the people who created you. The people who raised you and loved you and kissed your  boo-boos  when you got hurt. Unfortunately, sometimes it is necessary as Aubrey Perry, an Australian-based artist and author, recently discovered. In an article written for The Sydney Morning Herald, the young woman explained why she had to cut her parents out of her life and the life of her child.Perry was perusing a list of California Trump delegates when she discovered a horrifying name on the list: her mother s. I found her name when I was scanning the list to see if the white supremacist William Daniel Johnson had been removed (since he d said he would not be attending): there she was, #10 on the list. She said her parents have always been racist. Her mother, an ESL (English Second Language) teacher and basic English teacher at the college level, often referred to her students with contempt when Perry was growing up. She said: Greaseball. Wetback. Spic. Beaner. I grew up with these words in the house. Not because that s what people called us. That s what we called Mexicans. Perry explains that she knew her parents believed ignorant garbage, but because she lives in Australia and only speaks to her parents online, through text and on the phone it was easy to ignore   they never spoke about politics. However, after Perry saw her mom s name on the delegate list she started investigating and what she found is what ultimately led to her decision to severe ties: And I don t use Twitter much. But, wow. My mum does. I recently checked her Twitter page for the first time in a while and was shocked. Hateful memes, ugly language, and appearance-based attacks, targeted at Hillary Clinton, stacked up. And not just hateful, but off-topic and malicious calling Hillary  ugly ,  old  and  screechy . An  unlikeable old bag. The  woman card  stinks!  my mother wrote. My mother! A college instructor! She should know better. She s no internet troll. Is she? She was; her mom was a Trump troll and filled all of her social media accounts with racist, sexist, xenophobic memes and posts. She found videos of her mom being interviewed by Fox News at a California rally. Perry said the video shows her mom saying, He sounds like us, he talks like us   I m all Trump, only Trump, always Trump, forever Trump!  The video reminded her of the Imperial Wizard of the KKK saying that the Klan supports Trump because  what he believes in, we believe in. Perry isn t just an ordinary liberal who is disgusted with Donald Trump just because she is a progressive and he is a conservative; his beliefs hurt her family.  My husband is black. We have a daughter together. My parents  support of a candidate who could not decide if he should accept the endorsement of the KKK is completely intolerable in our home and, ultimately, in our world. She finally confronted her mother, and her mom brushed her off. So, she decided to take screenshots of her mom s hate speech, saved the video clips of her interview on Fox News and posted everything on Facebook, slamming her parents for their ignorance. On Twitter she said, Your Twitter feed makes me disappointed and embarrassed of you as a person, a supposed critical thinker, and my mother. Shocked.  Her mom responded by blocking her on social media. Her dad found out and sent her a threatening email, saying: I know you have never said anything you might not like to be made public,  he wrote,  so if you want to continue this attack mode, please remember all things have consequences. Perry said her parents  response to her criticism hurt her but she wasn t surprised. More importantly, though, she said it was time to speak up and let them know that their hate and ignorance was not acceptable. Her entire life she had kept her mouth shut and let their rhetoric roll off her back and that, she explains, is her biggest regret: By ignoring racism, xenophobia, and misogyny within our families, we are accepting it within our culture. To ignore is to accept. As my daughter plays on the floor in front of me while I type this, I think about her ancestry. I think about the suffering that has been endured so that she can live in a free and just world, and I feel a responsibility to the continuity of that humanity. If I don t oppose my parents  behaviour and objectives, if I don t reject Trump and all that he stands for, if I don t change my family s vocabulary so that my daughter never knows the hateful words I heard growing up, I m undoing the progress that generations before me have fought and died for. And that, I won t accept. She s exactly right. As a white woman with a mixed race child and a husband who is from Central America, I know where she is coming from. For a very long time I ignored the hate coming, not from my parents, but from other people who I was close to. People I d grown up with, gone to school with. It was easier to pretend they were not that stupid than to confront them and get into an argument. Like Perry, I came to the realization that by not telling these people how I felt, how their hate affected my son, my husband, our friendship, I was doing a disservice. I started speaking out, I m not friends with some of those people anymore and that s okay, they are not nice people anyway.The point is that by not speaking out, we lead these people to believe that what they are saying is acceptable and it isn t. Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel explains why it is important to use our voices to stop this kind of divisiveness, better than I ever could, while speaking to a group of college graduates in 2011: Do not stand idly by if you witness injustice. You must intervene. You must interfere. You are now going into a world which is hounded, obsessed with so much violence, often so much despair. When you enter this world and you say the world is not good today, good! Correct it! Featured image via Facebook",

        "text": "21st Century Wire says There have been a string of active shooter events prior to 2016 s first presidential debate this coming week   with many incidents appearing suspicious in nature. The Guardian reports that the apparent motive still remains unclear: A 20-year-old suspect was in custody on Sunday for the killing of five people during a deadly shooting at a mall in Burlington, Washington, two days before. Arcan Cetin of Oak Harbor, Washington, a legal permanent resident who had immigrated to the US from Turkey, was discovered  zombie-like , police said, on Saturday evening after police responded to a tip-off following an intensive 24-hour manhunt. Cetin was unarmed at the time of his arrest, authorities said. Although a motive for the shooting remains unclear, authorities told local media that Cetin s ex-girlfriend had previously worked at the targeted department store but left her job months ago. The suspect had been charged three times with domestic assault against his stepfather and had been ordered by a judge not to possess a firearm, according to the Seattle Times. At a Saturday press conference, the FBI said terrorism was not a suspected motive.

Such  training  is a consequence of the heightened federalization of local and regional law enforcement.The September 23 Cascade Mall shooting north of Seattle in northwest Washington State took place shortly before 7:00PM local time, and has certain suspect features evident in photos, particularly evidence of tents and porta-potties on the scene, as observed by a MHB reader.There is an absence of footage of wounded or deceased victims in triage or being given ambulatory services away from the scene. Instead, news media were told victims remained in the mall awaiting the local coroner. The Washington Post reports, As of Saturday morning, the bodies of the four female victims were still inside the mall, Skagit County coroner Hayley Thompson said at a news conference Saturday. Thompson said when she gained access to the scene, the four female victims would be taken to Skagit Valley Hospital and undergo autopsies. Such events are reported on by major news media uncritically, thus supporting the call for strengthened gun control measures while ironically stimulating gun purchases by a public that fears such restrictions.The Cascade Mall shooting s police spokesperson for the event is Washington State Patrol s Mark Francis. A press release was issued over 18 hours after the event transpired.",

Dick ChaneyDem Sen. Joe Manchin: Iran Nuclear Deal Endangers American SecurityHARRY REID CLAIMS VICTORY WITH THE IRAN DEAL: The deal President Obama and other world leaders struck with Iran is the  best chance  to stop the Islamic Republic s nuclear program, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday in a speech setting the stage for the intense floor fight over the agreement.Mr. Reid, Nevada Democrat, will be the key figure in leading support for Mr. Obama, and he has now mustered enough backers to mount a filibuster, which would deliver an early victory and prevent the deal from even having to go back to the White House for a final veto showdown. This agreement will stand,  Mr. Reid said in a speech at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Three new senators declared support for the deal Tuesday morning, giving Democrats 41 backers of the agreement. That is enough to guarantee they can sustain their filibuster and bottle the debate up in the Senate.Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Gary Peters of Michigan all threw their support behind the deal.Mr. Blumenthal called the agreement  better than no deal at all,  while Mr. Peters said he was only  reluctantly  backing it, and still had  serious reservations.

        "text": "Donald Trump s supporters are vicious and violent   a fact the incoming President-elect has traditionally refused to acknowledge even after two of his fans beat a Hispanic homeless man (and U.S. citizen) to death s door with a pipe and then urinated on him (Trump called those men  passionate  gentlemen who want to  make America great again ) or when they beat up random African-Americans at his rallies (he offered to pay their legal fees).Yes, The Donald s violent, xenophobic, meth-addled deplorable, racist, mindless followers are all that and more but on Friday at a Florida stop on his ridiculous  thank you tour,  he made an unpresidented (that s not a typo, just quoting a tweet of his) move: he actually admitted what sort of people flock to him, and it s exactly the sort of terms everyone else has always used to describe his fans: You people were vicious, violent, screaming,  Where s the wall? We want the wall!  Screaming,  Prison! Prison! Lock her up!  I mean you are going crazy. I mean, you were nasty and mean and vicious and you wanted to win, right? But now, you re mellow and you re cool and you re not nearly as vicious or violent, right? Because we won, right? But it s terms like  vicious  and violent  (especially  deplorables ) that used to set Trump off before he was elected.

        "text": "Because he was such a greedy prick that decided that profiting was more important than smart conservation and management of resources, Cliven Bundy s herd of cows is rumored to be facing starvation: Since the early 1990s, cattle have been left to fend for themselves in the desert after Cliven Bundy, a private rancher, lost his privilege to graze on federal public lands that belong to all Americans. This once-small herd of around 150 animals has grown to hundreds or more over the course of 20+ years and now badly exceeds the ability of the land to feed and nourish them. They range over an immense area about half the size of the state of Rhode Island. While the area is large, it only receives about 4 inches of precipitation a year and vegetation is very sparse. Once upon a time, the west was wild and cattle ranchers let their cows do whatever the hell they wanted. And what cows want to do is eat. And eat. And keep eating until there s nothing left. This is called  overgrazing,  and it s really REALLY bad for both the land and the cows. If you eat all the grass, it stops growing and the dirt blows away (Think  Dust Bowl ). And then it takes a very long time (if ever) for the grass to come back which means the cows go hungry.The ranchers, being all rugged and individualistic, originally thought that they could keep a handle on it. After all, the ranchers knew that overgrazing was bad so they would have an incentive to conserve the commons.But then the ranchers learned that even though people as a group were smart enough to conserve, there was always individual assholes that would take advantage of the situation. They would let their herd graze an area to death s door and then move on to do it somewhere else, getting rich off of hogging the resources that was supposed to be shared by everyone.Enter the Bureau of Land Management. These awful evil big government types exist to keep the aforementioned assholes in check. What bastards!Of course, this infuriates people like Bundy who only see dollar signs and to hell with everyone else:Rob Mrowka, a senior scientist with the center, said by phone that Bundy had given up his grazing rights in 1993 and simply let his cows loose to reproduce, leading to the situation where hundreds are starving now. .Normally areas of the range are rotated for grazing, with periods of rest to let it grow back, but Mrowka said the cattle  are there 24/7, 365 days.This is why Bundy was forever letting his cows go onto public land to eat OUR grass for free. Why worry about keeping your own land in good condition when you can make money by stealing the resources (grass is a staple food source for cows, making it a resource) from the public?In the process, Bundy is destroying the habitat of the endangered desert tortoise, but so what? He was making a hefty amount of money and that s all that mattered to him.This sense of entitlement and narcissism is why he s rotting in jail and will probably be there for the rest of his life. So sad.Meanwhile, now we have to deal with his starving cows before they actually start to die. Letting them suffer is unconscionable. We just have to hope that no one starts shooting at the federal agents that go to round them up before it s too late.Featured image of a random starving cow via Getty ",

Tim Kaine of Virginia as her running mate.Norman Solomon, a Sanders delegate from California, said Sunday that Clinton picking a centrist like Kaine is an  assault  on the progressive agenda. He said the roughly 1,250 Sanders delegates connected to his Bernie Delegates Network are considering walking out during the Virginia senator s expected acceptance speech at the Wells Fargo Center, and they are even looking into contesting his nomination.Via: FOX",

        "text": "What the heck is wrong with these loony liberal political hack Supreme Court justices? We had a proclamation from Latina Sotomayor that white men couldn t possibly know what it s like to be a minority huh?  Now we have Ruth  Buzzy  Ginsburg saying that if Hillary doesn t win then  everything is up for grabs . She also put in a plug for a pro-Hillary presidency saying she doesn t want to think about a Trump presidency. What the heck is up with these supposedly unbiased people who should not be speaking out politically. All the more reason to vote for Trump to make the court more conservative just to piss off the political hags hacks on the court WASHINGTON   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg says she doesn t want to think about the possibility of Donald Trump winning the White House, and she predicts the next president    whoever she will be    will have a few appointments to make to the Supreme Court.In an interview Thursday in her court office, the 83-year-old justice and leader of the court s liberal wing said she presumes Democrat Hillary Clinton will be the next president. Asked what if Republican Donald Trump won instead, she said,  I don t want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs. That includes the future of the high court itself, on which she is the oldest justice. Two justices, Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer, are in their late 70s. It s likely that the next president, whoever she will be, will have a few appointments to make,  Ginsburg said, smiling.She didn t sound as though she is preparing to step down soon and shows no signs of slowing down. Ginsburg said she has been catching up on sleep since the court finished its work last week before a busy summer of travel that will take her to Europe and, as is her custom, to see as much opera as she can fit in.In the wide-ranging interview, Ginsburg reviewed the just-ended term during which she lost her best friend on the court and, partly as a result, was on the winning side of most of the high-profile cases. Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, depriving his conservative allies of a reliable vote and leaving eight justices to decide nearly five dozen cases.President Barack Obama has nominated Judge Merrick Garland for the ninth seat, but Senate Republicans have refused to hold a hearing or vote on Garland s nomination, arguing the next president should have the right to name Scalia s replacement. Even if the Senate were to confirm Garland after the election, the court probably would hear three months of cases without him, Ginsburg said.And if there s no action in a post-election, lame-duck session of Congress, the vacancy could last the entire term, she said.She said court majorities this term moved to shut down tactics used by opponents of abortion and of affirmative action in higher education in two major cases.Ginsburg said she doesn t expect to see any more such cases after the court upheld the use of race in college admissions in Texas and struck down Texas abortion-clinic regulations that the state said were needed to protect patients. It seemed to me it was a sham to pretend this was about a woman s health,  rather than about making it harder to get an abortion, Ginsburg said.She disputed reports that the court is taking on only relatively unimportant cases while waiting for a ninth justice. It isn t so. We haven t selected them with a view to dodging challenging cases. We take them as they come to us,  she said.Via: CBS",

        "text": "As we all remember last year, Pope Francis made a historic visit and was beloved by pretty much everyone he came in contact with. However, there was a very dark cloud that hovered over his visit once it was discovered that he would be meeting with Kim Davis, the controversial Kentucky County Clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.Well, it looks as though the ambassador who set up the visit, and apparently kept Pope Francis in the dark about the whole thing, is about to be replaced. According The Advocate: Italian Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan  will leave the position of apostolic nuncio, the equivalent of an ambassador, and will be replaced by Archbishop Christophe Pierre, a French-born clergyman who is currently the nuncio to Mexico, Catholic magazine America reports, citing Sandro Magister, a blogger who covers the Vatican.The Vatican is not expected to confirm the news until the Obama administration has agreed to the new nuncio s appointment, the magazine notes, but it adds that  reliable sources  expect an official announcement before Easter, which falls on March 27 this year. Back in October after the visit with Davis, the Vatican released an official statement declaring that Pope Francis  meeting with the County Clerk  should not be considered a form of support.  Also stating: The brief meeting between Mrs. Kim Davis and Pope Francis at the Apostolic Nunciature in Washington, DC has continued to provoke comments and discussion. In order to contribute to an objective understanding of what transpired I am able to clarify the following points:The Vatican clearly went into crisis mode to very clearly clarify that Pope Francis was not supporting Kim Davis and her bigoted ways, as was originally construed. Now, with the replacement of the man who set the whole meeting up, it has been made extremely clear that this sort of thing isn t about to happen again.Kim Davis is a symbol of hate and bigotry, so to see Pope Francis, who has all too often been a shining symbol of hope and love, meet with Davis, it honestly broke a lot of people s hearts. And while the Pope is still not in favor of same-sex marriage, it s definitely a positive development to see that the responsible ambassador will be replaced. Pope Francis was clearly not pleased.Featured image via Wikipedia/Wikipedia/Wikipedia",

        "text": "He has been tried. He has been convicted. And now he has been sentenced for lying about his expertise and background to the United States Government.Fox News often brought Wayne Simmons aboard the channel to deliver his  expert  analysis on terrorism as a former CIA operative whenever a terrorist attack occurred somewhere in the world.Most notably, he appeared on the network after the terrorist attack in Paris last year that killed 130 people. Not only did he claim that there were hundreds of Muslim-controlled  no-go zones  across Europe, which Fox had to apologize for, he claimed that Muslims had 19 paramilitary training facilities in the Unites States.In January, Simmons appeared on Fox and called for surrounding these non-existent  no-go zones  with razor wire and shutting off utilities until all the Muslims surrender to be categorized by authorities.  That s how you close these no-go zones,  he said before using his false expertise to scare Americans with lies. It is incomprehensible that anywhere in the United States, these types of things would be allowed and, yet, my friend Ryan Mauro, as you probably know, reported that through the Clarion Project that we ve got at least 19 paramilitary Muslim training facilities in the United States. Are you kidding me? What are, what are they gonna do, go hunt deer during deer season? No. They re using paramilitary exercises to plan and execute these types of operations all over the United States. Here s the video via YouTube.But Simmons was soon outed as a fraud and now he gets to become a real expert at how to survive in prison.On Friday, Simmons was sentenced to serve 33 months behind bars portraying himself as an  Outside Paramilitary Special Operations Officer  for the CIA for nearly 30 years to get jobs within and outside of the government, which included his stint on Fox News and being sent to Afghanistan as an intelligence adviser.The 62-year-old was also sentenced by U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III to three years of supervision after his eventual release. He must also surrender two firearms and pay $176,000. Wayne Simmons is a fraud,  U.S. Attorney Dana Boente said.  Simmons has no military or intelligence background, or any skills relevant to the positions he attained through his fraud. Simmons frightened Americans for years through his appearances on Fox News and he put the lives of our troops in danger because of his lies.It makes one wonder how many other Fox News  experts  should be in prison right next to him.Featured Image: Screenshot",

        "title": "15 YR OLDS IN THIS STATE CAN NOW GET STATE FUNDED SEX-CHANGE OPERATION WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT\u2026But Need Consent To Use Tanning Bed",
        "text": "The left has officially taken parenting out of our hands via legislation and handed it over to our government The list of things 15-year-olds are not legally allowed to do in Oregon is long: Drive, smoke, donate blood, get a tattoo   even go to a tanning bed.But, under a first-in-the-nation policy quietly enacted in January that many parents are only now finding out about, 15-year-olds are now allowed to get a sex-change operation. Many residents are stunned to learn they can do it without parental notification   and the state will even pay for it through its Medicaid program, the Oregon Health Plan. It is trespassing on the hearts, the minds, the bodies of our children,  said Lori Porter of Parents  Rights in Education.  They re our children. And for a decision, a life-altering decision like that to be done unbeknownst to a parent or guardian, it s mindboggling. In a statement, Oregon Health Authority spokeswoman Susan Wickstrom explained it this way:  Age of medical consent varies by state. Oregon law   which applies to both Medicaid and non-Medicaid Oregonians   states that the age of medical consent is 15. While 15 is the medical age of consent in the state, the decision to cover sex-change operations specifically was made by the Health Evidence Review Commission (HERC).Members are appointed by the governor and paid by the state of Oregon. With no public debate, HERC changed its policy to include cross-sex hormone therapy, puberty-suppressing drugs and gender-reassignment surgery as covered treatments for people with gender dysphoria, formally known as gender identity disorder.HERC officials refused repeated requests by Fox News for an interview and even gave Fox News inaccurate information about the medical director s work schedule.Oregon Health Authority officials directed Fox News to their website. It shows transgender policy was discussed at four meetings in 2014. It was passed without any opposition or even discussion about teenagers  new access to undergoing a sex change.Gender dysphoria is classified by the American Psychiatric Association as a mental disorder in which a person identifies as the sex opposite of his or her birth. It is rare, affecting one out of every 20,000 males and one out of every 50,000 females.According to a 2008 study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,  most children with gender dysphoria will not remain gender dysphoric after puberty. Dr. Paul McHugh, who led the Johns Hopkins Psychiatry Department and still practices, said Oregon s policy amounts to child abuse.  We have a very radical and even mutilating treatment being offered to children without any evidence that the long-term outcome of this would be good,  McHugh said.Dr. Jack Drescher, a member of the APA who worked on the Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group, says treatment for gender dysphoria has received a lot more attention in recent years. He said this year New York changed its policy to cover cross-sex hormone drugs and sex-reassignment surgery for Medicaid recipients who are at least 18 years old. He thinks Oregon is offering the treatment too early. Children age 15 may not fully understand all the consequences of the procedures they are undergoing,  he said.Jenn Burleton disagrees. She underwent a sex-reassignment surgery and started the Portland non-profit group TransActive. She said requiring parental consent would lead to more suffering and teen suicide attempts. Parents may not be supportive,  Burleton said.  They may not be in an environment where they feel the parent will affirm their identity, this may have been going on for years. The science is unsettled. A 2010 Murad study concluded  very low quality evidence suggests sex reassignment   improves gender dysphoria and overall quality of life.  The authors admitted the evidence was  sparse and inconclusive. Lisa Maloney, a parent and Scappoose, Ore., School Board member, is outraged. To know that taxpayers are now on the hook for that, that a child can do that without their parent s knowledge or information or consent, parents have absolutely no say, that s appalling,  Maloney said.The Oregon Health Authority could not say how many Medicaid recipients have been treated for gender dysphoria since the new policy took effect in January. Oregon has 935,000 people enrolled in the Oregon Health Plan. HERC assumes between 14 and 112 of them may be gender dysphoric. It estimates the total cost of adding cross-sex hormone therapy, puberty-suppressing drugs and sex reassignment surgeries to the coverage will be no more than $150,000 per year.But HERC also believes the state will save money due to fewer suicide attempts. It estimates there will be one less suicide attempt per year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the average cost per suicide attempt in the U.S. is $7,234.But Dr. McHugh says a sex-change operation, especially for young people with gender dysphoria, is never appropriate. We can help them if we begin to explore with them and their families what they re fearing about development, what they re fearing about being a young boy, a young adolescent appropriate to themselves.

These lucky recipients also got themselves a  Make America Great Again  hat so their neighbors and friends know they have no problem wth racism and willful ignorance, Kleenex they can use when Hillary Clinton trounces Trump in November, and a fetus action figure. The fetus figure doesn t have kung-fu action grip, but it does come with a stupid little card that serves as a reminder that Republicans are entirely against women s rights. This card, which accompanies the disgusting fetus figures, is produced by the pro-life company, Heritage House:Bust reports that:The Heritage House site itself describes the models as  the most realistic fetal model ever developed. It s beautiful detail, softness and weight can really move hearts and change minds!  Well, I think if you re receiving one of these goodie bags as an RNC attendee, your mind is probably already made up.This is just another reminder that a Trump/Pence ticket is extremely dangerous. The Republican Party, at this point, has dedicated itself to radically dismantling Planned Parenthood, and they have worked hard to put as many roadblocks as possible between women and their legal right to choose to have an abortion (although, let s hope this soon changes due to a recent Supreme Court case).It may seem shocking that Trump would include this in a self-serving, self-promoting collection of products that celebrate himself, but let s remember that he thinks women should be  punished  for having an abortion. Pence has also signed a law that mandates funerals for aborted fetuses, so an item dedicated to making things harder on women during a time in which they are forced to make a difficult decision whether or not to terminate a pregnancy is absolutely something important enough to shove in a Trump gift bag.Watch Trump speak on the importance of punishing women for their health care choices below:Featured image via screengrab",

        "title": " Victorious Obama Schools GOP War-Mongers: Breakthrough With Iran Based On \u2018Smart\u2019 Diplomacy (VIDEO)",
        "text": "While Republicans continue to reveal their true colors by openly complaining about the release of American prisoners in Iran, President Obama is using his latest diplomatic success to teach his critics a lesson in what effective leadership really looks like.Obama had deliberately waited to talk about the hostage exchange until the American prisoners were out of Iran and safe, but upon news that the swap was a success and that the United Nations had certified that Iran was upholding its end of a landmark nuclear disarmament deal, the White House held a press conference that quickly turned into a  teachable moment  for those who had irresponsibly advocated for war over diplomacy. This is a good day, because once again we re seeing what s possible with strong American diplomacy,  Obama said at the White House. Yesterday marked a milestone in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,  he noted.  Most of important of all, we achieved this historic progress through diplomacy, without resorting to another war in the Middle East. And yet, somebody might want to tell the Republican Party that a victory like this without a single shot fired is considered a good thing. The friends at Fox and Friends were practically despondent when they had to tell their audience that the American prisoners in Iran were coming home.A good day for America is a bad one for Fox.Obama s negotiations were a massive blow to their narrative.For years, Republicans have insisted that the only way to get Iran to listen to the United States is through threats of war. Infamously, Republican Sen. John McCain ran for president on the platform of  bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran.  Even now, certain conservatives regret not being able to send troops into another Middle Eastern conflict. War is a tough addiction to kick.Nobody knows how much Republicans want war than President Obama. He s been boxing out the war-mongers for years. During his comments, he took a dig at those who say war is the only answer.Citing the cooling of tensions with Iran, Obama pointed out that his  smart, patient and disciplined approach to the world  has yielded results. America can do   and has done   big things when we work together,  Obama said.  We can lead this world and make it safer and more secure. But we can only do that if we stop listening to those who think threatening violence will make us look tough. America has tried that approach for decades and the situation with Iran had only been deteriorating. The change in recent months cannot be overstated.The nuclear talks have brought a sense of normalcy to relations with the U.S. and Iran, with top officials from each country in somewhat regular communication. While Obama emphasized that the U.S. continues to have deep concerns about Iran s destabilizing actions in the Middle East and its threats to Israel, he also opened up the prospect of Tehran working more cooperatively with the rest of the world.It s worth noting that those who want war with Iran represent a small minority of Americas   mostly Republican politicians and Fox News hosts. It s not a coincidence that McCain s  bomb Iran  campaign strategy contributed to his being absolutely smoked by Obama s  smart, patient and disciplined  one in the election. It s also not a big secret that Americans are tired of sending young kids off to die in intractable wars in the Middle East. With the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan finally winding down, it s only those in the GOP who seem eager to embark on a new one.If accomplishing America s goals of neutralizing Iran s nuclear program while avoiding war was the goal   and for most of the country, it was   then this deal represents a massive success for the country. For the bloodthirsty, it probably stings a little. Obama s clearly not sorry.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xABl2Aeaycc]Featured image via White House ",

James Proctor, who can be heard speaking in the recording, says he does live in the Acadiana area. Proctor says some of his comments were taken out of context as the published recording is only a portion of the hour and a half long meeting. He works with the group Indivisible Guide. The groups name can be heard on the recording of the meeting. Indivisible,  the George Soros spinoff outfit which is, along with Barack Obama s Organizing For America, collaborating to salt the town halls of Republican members of Congress with activists and agitators seeking to disrupt those town halls and make those members look bad on TV. This outfit scored a  win  of sorts on Bill Cassidy at his gathering in Metairie yesterday, packing the room with people who berated the senator with boos, uncivil questions and unhinged hectoring.Here s what Hillary had to say about Americans who were sickened by the organized protesters showing up at town hall meetings: If you can't stand the heat, get out of the Congress.https://t.co/TEAXDPEPrt  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 22, 2017Watch the shameful local news media giving these organized freaks media coverage, as though they were legitimate citizens who were just randomly attending Bill Cassidy s town hall meeting.

This reporter not only ignored both of those disgusting acts, she also goes to great lengths to discredit any idea that these people were organized. She even went as far as to attempt to make the viewers believe that some of these like minded people could have found out about this town hall meeting on a Facebook page:We, and other conservative media organizations in the state, received audio from someone   let s call him a concerned citizen   who sat in on an Indivisible meeting in Lafayette earlier this week wherein plans were being made to do the same thing to Cassidy tomorrow morning in Breaux Bridge.

Here s the leaked audio:What s not included in the Moon Griffon audio is this fun clip of the Indivisible people proposing to coordinate with Gov.

        "text": "Officially, history will record President-elect Donald Trump as having won the 2016 presidential race in Michigan by some 10,704 votes.But Dr. Jill Stein, the Green Party s presidential candidate in the 2016 election, believes that the numbers would be different if all 4.8 million votes cast in the Wolverine State were recounted.That won t happen, Stein conceded in a rally in downtown Detroit on Saturday, a day after the non-recused members of the Michigan Supreme Court ruled, by a 3-2 margin, against Stein s appeal, leaving the candidate with no recourse. We may be moving out of the court of law, but we re moving into the court of public opinion,  Stein said.The rally lasted about 40 minutes in freezing temperatures, and attracted dozens of the candidate s supporters. It took place near the foot of a street named ceremonially for Congressman John Conyers, Washington Boulevard. Bell, a Green Party member who helped supervise the vote-counting effort at Cobo, became emotional several times during her brief remarks, during which she called the election system in Michigan  a flaming hot mess,  a language Stein would herself adopt. Even if the results of the 2016 election won t change, and even if there won t be a full recount in Michigan, Stein said, the state needs election reform.Bell called out voting irregularities she d learned of, like how a polling place in Ionia County allegedly used a garbage can as a ballot box, or one in Gibraltar that sealed a ballot box with mere duct tape, or a precinct in Detroit that tabulated 300 votes but only 50 were found in the box. Hot mess! Hot mess!  Bell said before handing the microphone to Stein. Count every vote, and make sure every vote counts,  Stein said.  This dysfunction in our elections flows downhill. It flows to communities that do not have resources The equipment that s used is prone to break. And it s not just the 87 scanners that failed in Detroit on Election Day. What raised a  red flag  in Michigan, Stein said, was the 75,000 ballots cast without also making a choice in the presidential race. MLive",

        "text": "Shell admits to spilling 90,000 gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico on May 12, 2016. Footage of the spill, captured by Ecogig Scientist Dr. Ian MacDonald during a fly over of the site, shows that the company has vastly misrepresented the size and magnitude of the spill.According to MacDonald, the spill covers more than five square nautical miles, the equivalent of 20 square kilometers, or about 5,000 acres.Maps, flight logs and other documentation regarding the aerial survey of the May 12 Gulf oil spill can be found here.MacDonald s survey of the deepwater spill found that the extent of the damage is not consistent with the company s stated figures.As MacDonald reports here:Even if the average thickness of the visible oil were a mere 100 micron (0.1 millimeter, vastly smaller than the areas of emulsified oil that stretch across the area), the visible surface oil would represent about 500,000 gallons of oil.MacDonald is with the nonprofit organization On Wings Of Care. The group has conducted hundreds of aerial surveys and logged thousands of flight-tracking hours since 2004, working in the Gulf of Mexico, Pacific Ocean coast and many other areas.Referring to the recent Shell oil spill, which is located about 100 miles off the coast of Louisiana, MacDonald stressed the severity of what he observed, saying: We haven t seen images like this since the BP disaster of 2010.According to his report, which can be read here, the smell of oil was so strong that it was physically  uncomfortable  for the crew to fly closer than 1,000 feet above the spill.During the fly over MacDonald observed two small  clean-up  vessels.According to the report:There were two skimming vessels in the vicinity, but they appeared to be on the distant periphery of the slick, and the amount of oil that appeared to be within their booms was pitifully small compared to the size of the slick, which covered over 5 square nautical miles.On May 16, SkyTruth, a nonprofit environmental organization based in West-Virginia, blasted Shell s response to the spill calling it  a joke, but not a very funny joke,  writing:Thank you, Shell, for demonstrating quite convincingly over the past 4 days that oil spill cleanup is nothing more than a convenient fantasy.The organization also raised alarms about the shoddy monitoring of offshore drilling operations, noting that the recent spill was discovered entirely by accident.This spill was discovered accidentally by a helicopter pilot flying over the area who happened to spot the slick.  That s right: a modern pipeline at a high-tech deepwater development project leaked thousands of gallons of oil, and that leak was accidentally discovered.  Not because high-tech telemetry on the pipeline signaled an alarm due to a drop in pressure; not because flow metering detected a difference between what was going in one end of the pipe vs. what was coming out the other.  How long would this leak have continued, if not for the sheer luck of having a vigilant pilot happening by?Here s the disturbing footage from MacDonald s fly over of the spill.

        "text": "This is either really funny or a dangerous escalation. A group of armed  patriots  that have been showing up to mosques to terrorize Muslims going to pray were scared off by a larger group of armed African American counter-protesters:Racial tensions in South Dallas almost exploded at an anti-mosque protest Saturday afternoon before quickly dissolving when the protesters retreated.A few hundred South Dallas residents, mostly black, flooded Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to oppose a planned demonstration by a mostly white group that routinely protests outside mosques.Both sides were armed.The mosque in question was a predominately black one and the counter-protesters were chanting  Black Power  at the  Murikan protesters.Unfortunately, the counter-protesters included members of the New Black Panther Party. If that name doesn t ring a bell, it s a group of pretenders to the legacy of the Black Panthers that spread anti-white bigotry, something the Black Panthers did not do (much). This is why a counter-protest to protect a mosque became racialized. While I have no doubt most of the protesters were racist as well as anti-Muslim, shifting the focus away from the religious bigotry to racism doesn t help Muslims in the long run. It does, however, help the NBPP and their message of anti-white hate.But although I don t approve of the bigotry, I do approve of the counter-protest. Ammosexuals have been terrorizing people for far too long and it was nice to see them show their true colors when their victims have guns, too. Liberals have been not-exactly-joking that black people need to start carrying rifles to push back against the targeting of their communities and, unsurprisingly, it worked.The problem is that Fox News and right wing media is going to explode over this. Nothing gets ratings like scary black people threatening innocent whites just defending their country blablabla. The racism will flow thick and heavy and  some people  will ask if this is the beginning of Sharia Law in America and the ISIS takeover.The original protesters,  BAIR  (the Bureau of American Islamic Relations, a silly play on CAIR, a Muslim group) is going to scream  persecution  and beg for help  fighting  the evil Muslims/scary black people. The next protest will be far larger, with more guns and filled with people just aching for a gun fight to break out. The potential for bloodshed will be a nightmare for the police.Keep an eye on Texas, this could get real ugly, real quick.Here s the video:Featured image via screencap",

Colbert resurrected his former conservative Colbert Report character, playing devil s advocate by grilling  the senator on his polices, even suggesting that he was promoting  class warfare.  Colbert said that trying to take power away from the 1% was not going to be easy.  I ll tell you how I know, I am in the top 1 percent.  Colbert also warned of revolution which Sanders advocates by quoting John F. Kennedy. He said: Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. Sanders, however, rejected the idea that his revolution would go bad. He said: What the goal of this campaign is about is to look at the Civil Rights Movement, look at the women s movement, look at the gay movement, understand that when people come together we can accomplish enormous things. But I think what people are saying is enough is enough. We need fundamental changes in our political system and our economic system. Sanders is right. Thinking outside of the box is what creates both innovation and change and Sanders sums it up perfectly: We used to have a segregated society. African-Americans couldn t go to schools, couldn t drink at water fountains. Millions of people stood together and said,  Hey, enough is enough. That is not what America is supposed to be about. Americans are on board with Sanders  message. He s scored a resounding victory in New Hampshire, especially with America s youth, collecting 86% of the vote in the 18-24 age bracket.

        "text": "The race is heating up as New York heads into their primary this coming Tuesday. Currently, polls have Hillary Clinton ahead by ten to seventeen points. Clinton, who is ahead nationally by more than 200 pledged delegates and hundreds more superdelegates, will need to win her home state to continue momentum after Sanders  string of wins in the previous weeks.A New York win for Clinton will mean more delegates she desperately needs, and with that will come superdelegate support.But the superdelegates have continued to cause controversy within the Democratic primary. Supporters who back Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders have decried the system, feeling the individuals who make up the superdelegate system have been manifestly unfair as to how they allocate their support.Supporters within the Sanders camp have demanded that the superdelegates vote the same way as the pledged   at the will of the voters for that state.But that isn t how the superdelegate system is set up (another word for superdelegates is unpledged delegates).However, that hasn t stopped the demands. And it hasn t stopped the harsh criticism, either. While these delegates have been regarded as  shills,   bought-and-paid-for  and  establishment, one superdelegate wants to remind the nay-sayers of one thing: they are still human.Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Congress  first openly-lesbian senator, is also a superdelegate. And she s pretty fed up with the inquisitions. On MSNBC s Morning Joe, the progressive senator claimed if Sanders clinches the popular vote by the time the convention is held in July, she will cast her vote for him. However, as Clinton continues her popular vote lead, she s supporting the former Secretary of State. She added, nervously: I am a human being and a Superdelegate. To put it plainly, based on how the rules are set up, Baldwin is free to vote her conscience, and her conscience says Hillary Clinton for now. Those who back Senator Sanders point to the fact he beat Clinton by 13 points in Wisconsin, thus Baldwin is somehow obligated to back him.It is important to remember that these superdelegates are party leaders who, in their own right, have been elected within the Democratic Party   whether it be a position within the DNC, or a senatorial, gubernatorial or representative position. It s also important to remember these delegates have nothing but the best of intentions for their party and the future of the country.Baldwin hasn t reported any harassment, but other superdelegates have (one s 12 year old child received the brunt of hrrasment when they answered the phone).Here s Baldwin s appearance on MSNBC:  Featured image via Astrid Riecken/Getty Images",

But if the movement that has done such a good job in 2017 at protecting our institutions only protects our institutions, I think they are going to miss an opportunity. The plan for progressives, Giridharadas argues, should be to take the resistance movement to people who allegedly don t like them, tell those folks their way of thinking is wrong, and convince them to join forces against the president.

        "title": " White Hollywood Stars Say Black Actors Should Be \u2018Patient\u2019, And The Oscar Boycott Is \u2018Anti-White Racism\u2019",
        "text": "High profile back stars from Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith to Spike Lee will be boycotting this year s Oscar s ceremony in solidarity over the persistence of racism in Hollywood. But for one (white) nominee, this is all just a case of  racism against whites. First, veteran Hollywood star and Oscar-winner Michael Caine told black stars they must be  patient  and await the point where they are permitted full entry to the Academy.He was joined by actor Charlotte Rampling, who is nominated for Best Actress for her role in 45 Years, and will be competing against four other white actresses   Brie Larson, Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett and Saoirse Ronan.Not only will there be no black actor in this category, but there will be no black actor in any category of the Oscars in 2016. Not a single nomination.However, like Caine, Rampling believes that black stars of Hollywood are making a fuss about nothing. Worse, that their calls for greater representation in Hollywood amounts to racism against her and her fellow white actors. She said during a radio interview on Friday: It s racist to whites. One can never really know, but perhaps the black actors did not deserve to make the final list.  Then, in a final fit of white privilege she added: Why classify people? These days everyone is more or less accepted, People will always say  Him, he s not as handsome  or  Him, he s too black  or  He s too white. But does that necessarily mean there should be lots of minorities everywhere? What does it mean that [black actors] still think they are a minority? It would be a much better world if Rampling was right, if black actors were being judged on their merits and simply fell short. But if she truly believes this, her disconnect from reality is profound. As Variety points out:In 1956, Variety ran a series of articles asking why there aren t better roles for black actors. Three decades later, the situation hadn t improved. On Feb. 19, 1982, Variety carried the front-page banner NAACP faults film employment. Last year, the hopes for diversity were based on one film, Paramount s  Selma,  which earned two nominations, for best pic and song (winning the latter). This year, there were more opportunities, including  Creed, Straight Outta Compton  and  Chi-raq,  as well as  Beasts of No Nation. This year, it s even worse.Surprising omissions from the actor race this year included Idris Elba for  Beasts of No Nation,  Will Smith for  Concussion,  Michael B. Jordan from  Creed  and the many young actors in  Compton. To add insult to injury, despite the fact that Creed featured a black actor in the starring role, and was written by a black man   the only nominee was a white man.Not only is Hollywood failing to acknowledge the black actors who have delivered breathtaking performances throughout the year, but the industry is also decades behind television in providing leading roles for black actors in mainstream movies which make them household names. As The Guardian discovered when they crunched the numbers:A 2012 Los Angeles Times study found that nearly 94% of Oscar voters were white. Some 2% were black and 2% were Latino. More than three quarters of voters were male. The median age was 62.So, let s be clear, this is not about hurt feelings. This about a very real, systemic issue. And as these figures show, it s not just on race where Hollywood fails to reflect the diversity of our societies.It is far better that white stars stand in unity, like George Clooney and Michael Moore, to help transform Hollywood for the better   than they stick their head in the sands and continue to ignore an unjust status quo. But for some, the reality of racial prejudice is an ugliness they would rather pretend doesn t exist.Featured Image via Wikimedia Commons/Wikimedia Commons/Mod.Com",

Although none of the companies have publicly said why they are pulling out, Trump s continuous slamming of the Ford Corporation could explain why the motor company is calling it quits. Sources close with Wells Fargo say they will continue to sponsor the Democratic National Convention because of a large market outreach in Philadelphia.Coca-Cola has also pulled out of the RNC, citing bad publicity.Reports are surfacing that delegates for the RNC are gearing up to stage a coup against trump, thus brokering the convention and thwarting the billionaire s chances of taking on Hillary Clinton (who would mop the floor with him).Their decision to pull out comes as the RNC is close to reaching their goal of $64 million to fund the convention. With these companies now retracting their monetary support, the RNC will have to find new ways to make up for the lost funds. Maybe they could ask their nominee? He is a  billionaire,  after all.Several months ago, the New York Times reported Apple, Walmart, and Google are considering pulling out as well, as public pressure mounts against the presumptive nominee.Republican fundraising consultant Carla Eudy told the Times:I have talked to several people at companies who have said,  I ve always gone to the convention, I ve always participated at some level, but this year we re not putting it in our budget, we re not going, we re no going to sponsor any of the events going on.Things aren t looking good for the RNC, and yet Reince Priebus insists everything is O.K. when, in fact, nothing is O.K.

        "title": "WATCH: SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM DROPS BOMBSHELL\u2026 FINALLY Confirms The Fake Russian Dossier Was Used To Obtain FISA Warrant To Spy On Trump",
        "text": "Everyone suspected the sketchy Steele Dossier was what corrupt FBI and DOJ officials used to get the October 2016 FISA warrant against Trump. FBI and DOJ officials refuse to answer that question publicly.Rep Ron DeSantis (R-FL) said in a statement: We now know that the so-called Steele dossier was paid for by the Democratic Party in an effort to gin up negative information regarding then-candidate Trump. What the American people deserve to know is whether the information compiled by Steele on the Democrats  dime was used by the Obama administration to obtain approval to conduct surveillance against Trump associates. The FBI has stonewalled producing these documents for months and their production shouldn t be limited to closed door viewing by a small number of members of Congress. The Trump administration should immediately declassify all the documents used to obtain surveillance warrants against Trump or his associates. Immediately after his inauguration, President Trump came out swinging over the  fake  Russian dossier. He even went as far as to blame the intelligence community.  President Trump was immediately criticized for his comments, and the media behaved as though he was insane to even insinuate such a wild theory. As it turns out, he wasn t too far off the mark.CT   Despite a hundred different ways congressional investigators have asked the question, and despite numerous on-camera questions to FBI and DOJ officials about the 2016 FISA process, no-one had definitively confirmed the Christopher Steele  Russian Dossier  was the underlying evidence for the 2016 FISA application to gain wiretaps and electronic surveillance upon presidential candidate Donald Trump. UNTIL NOW.Senator Lindsey Graham just confirmed the sketchy Steele Dossier was used to get the wiretap and surveillance warrant from the FISA court. Brian Kilmeade understood what he was hearing was serious, but didn t quite catch the specific gravity of it. Watch at starting at the 04:10 mark: The back-story to the FISA warrant is the cornerstone. The back-story contains both the FBI and the DOJ scheme. Expose it, remove it, and the entire  muh Russia conspiracy  collapses under the weight of sunlight This is critical and important because the specific use of the Steele Dossier underpins the BIG UGLY and exposes the entire top-tier apparatus of the FBI Counterintelligence Division (Peter Strzok, Bill Priestap, James Baker, Andrew McCabe) and the DOJ National Security Division (John Carlin, Stuart Evans, Mary McCord and Sally Yates), as well as DOJ Bruce Ohr and FBI lawyer Lisa Page directly to  conspiracy  charges.The 2016 FBI counterintelligence operation was surveillance on the Trump Campaign and was thinly disguised under the fraudulent auspices of a FISA warrant, sold as a defense of U.S. democracy from Russia, which permitted the wiretaps and surveillance etc.The DOJ involvement surrounds legal arguments, processing of FISA applications, and use of the legal system to support the FBI operation with actionable legal framing (against Trump). The DOJ National Security Division carried out that collaboration with the FBI.Tablet Mag did a deep dive into the Fusion-GPS connection to the creation of the Steele Dossier; and more specifically how Fusion-GPS head Glenn Simpson and his wife Mary Jacoby were instrumental in getting the dossier assembled and into the hands of the White House prior to the DOJ and FBI applying for the FISA warrant   SEE HERE.Tablet Mag outlines how Mary Jacoby even bragged about getting the  Russiagate  narrative started:A Tablet investigation using public sources to trace the evolution of the now-famous dossier suggests that central elements of the Russiagate scandal emerged not from the British ex-spy Christopher Steele s top-secret  sources  in the Russian government which are unlikely to exist separate from Russian government control but from a series of stories that Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson and his wife Mary Jacoby co-wrote for TheWall Street Journal well before Fusion GPS existed, and Donald Trump was simply another loud-mouthed Manhattan real estate millionaire.Understanding the origins of the  Steele dossier  is especially important because of what it tells us about the nature and the workings of what its supporters would hopefully describe as an ongoing campaign to remove the elected president of the United States.[ ] In a Facebook post from June 24, 2017, that Tablet has seen in screenshots, Jacoby claimed that her husband deserves the lion s share of credit for Russiagate. (She has not replied to repeated requests for comment.)  It s come to my attention that some people still don t realize what Glenn s role was in exposing Putin s control of Donald Trump,  Jacoby wrote.  Let s be clear. Glenn conducted the investigation. Glenn hired Chris Steele. Chris Steele worked for Glenn. This assertion is hardly a simple assertion of family pride; it goes directly to the nature of what became known as the  Steele dossier,  on which the Russiagate narrative is founded. (read more)The Tablet-Mag outline shows the distinct trail of the finished Steele Dossier entering into the White House and how President Obama likely saw and reviewed the content.However, missing from this report is an origination angle even more nefarious.Remember, previous media reporting -in conjunction with Clinton campaign admissions- have confirmed the DNC and Clinton Campaign financed Fusion-GPS through their lawyers within Perkins Coie. Fusion then hired Nellie Ohr the wife of DOJ Deputy Bruce Ohr who thereafter sub-contracted with retired British MI6 agent Christopher Steele to write/research/provide credibility for  the dossier. The dates here are important because they tell a story.The origin of the Clinton effort with Fusion-GPS was April 2016. That s the same month Fusion hired Nellie Ohr, wife of DOJ Deputy Bruce Ohr, to gather opposition research on candidate Trump. It would be most likely that Nellie Ohr was in contact with Christopher Steele. DOJ Deputy Attorney Bruce Ohr was later demoted for his unreported contacts with Christopher Steele and Fusion-GPS founder Glenn Simpson in October 2016; the same month the FISA warrant was granted.However, there was another event in this April 2016 timeline which enhances the trail of the Dossier origination. [Hat Tip Katica] Check this out:In April 2016 Mary Jacoby shows up on White House visitor logs meeting with President Obama officials. In April 2016 the Clinton Campaign and DNC hired Fusion-GPS to organize the Russia research, that later became known as the  Steele Dossier .(link to White House Logs)The wife of Glenn Simpson (Fusion GPS), Mary B. Jacoby, with years of Russia-angled reporting  including Donald Trump  visits the White House in April 2016, at the same time as the DNC and Clinton hire Fusion GPS to conduct the opposition research on Donald Trump, surrounding Russia?This timeline is entirely too obvious to be coincidental.Expand slightly and consider:April: Mary Jacoby, wife of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, visits the White House. The Clinton Campaign and DNC then hire Fusion GPS to conduct  Opposition Research , with a Russian emphasis. Fusion GPS then hires Nellie Ohr who specializes in Russian-centric counterintelligence. Nellie Ohr then contacts MI6 agent Christopher Steele to write a Russian Dossier. A month later, May 2016: Nellie Ohr s husband inside the DOJ, Bruce Ohr, is then working with FBI counterintelligence head Peter Strzok. By June 2016: Peter Strzok, Bruce Ohr, and DOJ Attorney Lisa Page then apply for the first FISA warrant.[June 24th, 2017, Mary Jacoby appears on Facebook taking credit for the origination of the Russiagate narrative.]This timeline is so transparent it s deafening.[More from the Tablet] Simpson and Jacoby had ID d Manafort as a world-class sleazeball and they were right. A slick Georgetown Law grad running in GOP circles since the Reagan campaign, Manafort used his talents and connections to get paid by some very bad people. I would only add here that, in my personal experience, journalists are not in the habit of forgetting major stories they ve written, especially stories with a character like Manafort at the center.So when the Trump campaign named Paul Manafort as its campaign convention manager on March 28, 2016, you can bet that Simpson and Jacoby s eyes lit up. And as it happened, at the exact same time that Trump hired Manafort, Fusion GPS was in negotiations with Perkins Coie, the law firm representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, to see if there was interest in the firm continuing the opposition research on the Trump campaign they had started for the Washington Free Beacon. (more)Mary Jacoby and Glenn Simpson   Fusion GPSIf the counterintelligence FISA warrant was obtained through deception, misleading/manipulated information, or fraud; and that warrant is what led to the wiretapping and surveillance of candidate Donald Trump and General Flynn; and that warrant was authorized by FISA Court Judge Contreras  who was the judge in Flynn s case, and is now recused  the entire tenuous FBI and DOJ operation begins to collapse and the outline of a  conspiracy  becomes clearly evident.The back-story to the FISA warrant is the cornerstone.

        "text": "There is no reason to believe the welfare of our veterans would be a priority for Obama after he leaves office, considering they were never a priority for the 8 years he occupied the White House.A charity group that helps homeless military veterans on Chicago s South Side says the city is trying to take control of the meager facility to make way for the restaurants, shops and other commercial venues that would complement the proposed Obama presidential library and museum.Group leaders said the RTW Veterans Center is the last privately-owned property on a stretch of S. King Boulevard near the proposed Washington Park site for the Barack Obama Presidential Center and that city building inspectors unexpectedly arrived last April to find an overwhelming 32 code violations at the facility. We don t appreciate being muscled out and put in the situation of having to negotiate from a position of despair,  facility center Director Jah Ranu Menab told FoxNews.com on Saturday.Menab thinks the University of Chicago, which is working with the Obama Foundation to bring the presidential center to the South Side, is also part of an apparent effort to ultimately force the facility into receivership.The fate of the veterans  facility   which officials say serves more than 3,000 meals monthly   may well be decided Tuesday, when officials return to Cook County Circuit Court for a hearing on the efforts to fix the building s problems.Menab admits that the facility is in disrepair, with some violations related to a fire hazard, rats  nests and raw sewage flowing onto the basement floor.However, he says the situation, which includes fines of $16,000 daily, looks like an attempted  land grab  and that the prestigious university, where Obama was a law professor,  exerts a tremendous amount of influence  over the city and its future.The university strongly denies any involvement in the city s dealings with the center and its building and on Friday issued the following statement: The mission of providing support for veterans is extremely important, and numerous University of Chicago community members have volunteered their time at the RTW Veterans Center. The university is not engaged in discussions regarding the center s property and has no plans to purchase it. Veterans  center co-founder Daniel  Doc  Habeel, a Vietnam War veteran, acknowledged Saturday that people associated with the university have indeed volunteered time. But he also expressed uncertainty about the university s involvement. The not-for-profit facility, which receives no government funding, cited in a press release Wednesday a history of building inspectors in other places forcing a worn-out building into receivership so a prospective developer is  eventually able to acquire the property without having to negotiate. The city says the fines are not being enforced and that the case landed in court because numerous 311 calls led inspectors to visit the facility, where they learned about the severity of the problems, including a structurally unsafe porch.

        "text": "Obama is clearly attempting to strip Americans of our right to express our opinions on social issues based on our religion or morals. Americans have found themselves in a scary place, where we are remaining silent when we know we should be speaking out, because we re afraid of being shamed by the progressive Left. Meanwhile the Left continues to blur the lines of morality, hoping that they will erase all individual thought and speech.In a communist society, the individual s best interests are indistinguishable from the society s best interest. Thus, the idea of an individual freedom is incompatible with a communist ideology. The only reason to hold individual speech and information rights would be to better the society. Some of us care little about the debate over public bathrooms. We do, however, care about the ongoing destruction of federalism, individual choice, and good-faith debate.One reliable way to quash dissent and force moral codes on others is to liken your cause to that of the civil rights fight. Every liberal issue is situated somewhere on the great historical arc of  equality  and  justice.  If a person stands against even one of these causes which were once great but are increasingly trivial they have, according to the cultural imperialists of the Obama administration, aligned themselves with the Klan. Literally.After U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Department of Justice had filed a federal lawsuit to stop North Carolina from passing a  controversial law this is the go-to characterization of conservative bills that pass with healthy majorities requiring transgender people to use public bathrooms matching their birth certificate, she had this to say:This is not the first time that we have seen discriminatory responses to historic moments of progress for our nation. We saw it in the Jim Crow laws that followed the Emancipation Proclamation; we saw it in the fierce and widespread resistance to Brown v. Board of Education; and we saw it in the proliferation of state bans on same-sex unions that were intended to stifle any hope that gay and lesbian Americans might one day be afforded the right to marry.Likening a spat over biologically segregated boy/girl bathrooms to the genuine, violent, systematic, state-sponsored, society-wide bigotry that took place in this country for a century is both intellectually and morally corrupt. It s not all a continuum. Yet this administration peddles these kinds of risible comparisons in the cause of self-aggrandizement all the time. Hans Fiene has coined it Selma envy.The present situation is significantly different, and in every possible sense less dire. It is the sort of social problem generally worked out amongst people in this country without unelected civil rights commissions punishing business owners for thought crimes. Under North Carolina s law no one was stopping a private company or coffee shop or big box store from having any kind of bathroom set-up they desire. I m pretty sure most voters don t comprehend this fact when they hear the distorted coverage of these laws in the news.North Carolina and other states have preemptively moved forward with these kinds to bills to head off the state redefining gender. Too late. The fact is that the federal government can simply announce that a man can be a woman and vice versa if they choose. It then compels everyone in country to accept this reality. Yet there is no government definition of what transgendered means, other self-identification, which can mean anything.  Civil Rights  Division Chief Vanita Gupta says:  Transgender men are men.   Transgender women are women.  So sayeth Vanita Gupta, so sayeth we all. Or else. And now 300 million people have adhere to the Obama administration s relativistic notions about nature and gender.Now, from what I can gather the central anxiety of many people is not that the transgendered will take advantage of their children, but that any man can simply declare himself a woman, put on a wig, and go into a public bathroom. Maybe it s an irrational fear, maybe it s not. As a father who s had to send young daughters into busy public bathrooms, I know one thing for sure: I could not care less what Vanita Gupta has to say on the topic.In a broader sense, the suit is symbolic of the federal government s eight-year crusade to decimate any semblance of federalism and streamline progressive morality. The administration ignores state laws that conflict with federal policy when it approves and it sues states when it does not. States that pass law enforcement bills President Obama finds unsatisfactory will see the full force of the Justice Department come down on them. Those with drug legalization laws and immigration laws he does like, even if they conflict with federal law, have nothing to worry about. Whether one agrees in theory with these moves and I am liberal on drug legalization and immigration allowing Washington to selectively enforce law conflicts with the kind of republicanism that allows us to be diverse and deal with unique problems locally.For entire story: The Federalist",

        "text": "DANIEL GREENFIELD NAILS IT! This is one of the best resourced and stated takes on what America s going through that I ve ever read. Thank you Mr. Greenfield! Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam.The Congressional Black Caucus is the most ridiculously corrupt part of an already corrupt Congress. A study two years ago found that a third of black congressmen had been named in an ethics probe during their careers. 5 of the 6 members under review by the House Ethics Committee that year were CBCers. In 2009, every single member of Congress under investigation was from the same old gang.Like the Clinton Foundation, the CBC exists to trade money for influence. The Caucus takes in tens of millions from major corporations and spends it on parties for its members and funnels the rest into fake non-profits. Even the minority scholarships endowed with great ceremony as a way of providing opportunity to their underprivileged constituents have a way of going to their own children and friends.The Congressional Black Caucus claims that it s  the conscience of the Congress  when it s actually the tip of a corrupt urban political machine that keeps black people in chains. Its members are lying idiots whose only response to criticism (including the ethics charges leveled against them) is to shout racism because that is the job they were chosen for by their real backers and masters.Consider Representative Sheila Jackson Lee; the dumbest member of the CBC notorious for believing that we won the Vietnam War and that our astronauts had planted a flag on Mars.Back in 2002, Sheila Jackson Lee announced on CNN,  I happen to represent Enron here in Houston.  That was an accurate summary. Her campaign had been funded by Enron. After Enron disappeared, other companies came along eager to funnel money to Sheila Jackson Lee and the CBC.Attempted major mergers between AT&T and T-Mobile and between Time Warner and Comcast were financed with major donations from the participants to the CBC. CBC members enthusiastically signed on to the AT&T merger claiming that it would help black people.It wouldn t have, but it certainly helped CBC members.Cell phone companies, dirty banks and drug companies all benefit from CBC intervention at the expense of their constituents. Like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, the CBC is an example of the merger between corporate corruption and urban political corruption masquerading as civil rights. That s why CBC members are not only noted for being ridiculously corrupt, but also for being ridiculously stupid.In addition to Sheila Jackson Lee, there s Hank Johnson who claimed that an added Marine presence might cause the island of Guam to tip over, Maxine Waters who accused the CIA of selling crack in black neighborhoods or Frederica Wilson who claimed that the term  illegal alien  is offensive because  To me an alien is somebody who is from another planet . Much like the brain of the average CBC member.And who could forget Marcia Fudge s stirring condemnation of the Tea Party.  These same people believe if you do not work, you are lazy. These same people believe that if your children don t get a good education, something is wrong with you. These are the craziest people I have seen in my life. Just absolute nuts. They don t understand that the government s job is to take care of its people. Like Sheila Jackson Lee, their stupidity was not an accident.The best corrupt politicians are too stupid to understand the consequences and too shameless to care about ethics. CBC members are carefully selected for their worst qualities. They are national examples of the corrupt urban political machine that has crippled black communities around the country.The next wave of CBC members who sought statewide and national office appeared to be made of better stuff. The wave hit its peak with Obama, who campaigned as a modern non-tribal politician striving for national excellence. Unlike Jesse Jackson, Obama appeared to be a fundamentally different type of urban politician. Their mutual hostility only reinforced that.But the CBC s next wave of smooth-talking Ivy League pragmatists who were supposed to save black communities proved to be just as rotten. After all the publicity, Cory Booker not only didn t turn Newark around, he turned out to be using it as a springboard for higher political office. Once in office, Obama proved to be every bit as tribally racist as any CBC member and twice as corrupt as the worst of them.As he presides over national race riots that he helped fuel, the whole country is getting a taste of what living under the governance of the urban political machine in the inner city looks like.In Baltimore, the latest flash point of Obama s race riots, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, an Oberlin grad and the daughter of an important politician, was supposed to be a step up from the incompetence and corruption of her predecessor who had been convicted of stealing gift cards meant for the poor. Instead she promised that casinos would fix everything and when they didn t, she went on spending.Even without the #BlackLivesMatter riots, Baltimore was on the road to financial ruin just like Chicago and Detroit. The urban political machine found the riots convenient because while it destroyed businesses, it let them blame the city s economic disaster on racism instead of corruption.State s Attorney Marilyn Mosby s already botched prosecution of the police officers is just more political theater to distract the people of the city from what their political establishment has done to them. Like Rawlings-Blake, Mosby and her husband have shown us that the next generation of the political machine is slicker, but no cleaner or more competent than its predecessors.The Baltimore political establishment panders to criminals because it s run by criminals. This is a city whose mayor only has her job because her predecessor was convicted and whose NAACP boss tried to claim that her son s heroin was really insulin which he was using to kill mice in the NAACP offices. Meanwhile Mosby is claiming that someone hacked her Twitter account to favorite racist tweets.When Obama moved into the White House, the corruption of the urban political machine joined him there. His attorney general had been slammed by Congress over Pardongate s paid pardons for fugitives. Holder set the tone for an administration that casually traded cash for political favors. It lied about the economy and terrorism, and when the lies were exposed, it touched off race riots to distract everyone.America is now being run just like Baltimore.Read more: Front Page",

        "text": "While Bernie Sanders has pitched himself as the presidential candidate for the little guy   tapping into the wallets of voters angry over Wall Street s influence in politics   a deeper dive shows Sanders has enlisted an arsenal of millionaire and billionaire backers who have backed his political career since his early Senate runs a decade ago.That big-money support stands in sharp contrast to Sanders  calls for corporate fat-cats and the uber-wealthy to pay their  fair share  in taxes by closing loopholes and removing breaks that benefit the mega-rich.At a rally last Sunday at The Ohio State University, Sanders told a cheering crowd,  You can tell a lot about a candidate based on how he or she raises money for his or her campaign. The comment goes hand-in-hand with the theme Sanders has been hammering for months. I am not raising money from millionaires and billionaires,  Sanders said during the CNN Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas on Oct. 13.  In fact, tonight, in terms of what a political revolution is about, there are 4,000 house parties   100,000 people in this country   watching this debate tonight who want real change in this country. Sanders war chest has been driven by smaller donations   he raised $26 million in small increments in the third fund-raising quarter.Jeff Weaver, Sanders  campaign manager, insists the fancy fundraisers and big-name donors are few and far between and that there is no contradiction in what the Vermont Democrat and self-described socialist practices and what he preaches. We don t have a super PAC,  Weaver told FoxNews.com.  We rely on small contributions. Average contribution is $27. Are there some, a few people in there who have more money, personal money who give larger contributions? Yeah, of course they do, but within the federal $2700 limit. No, you know, no 50, 100, 2 million contributions. But for years Sanders has enjoyed donations from a handful of wealthy donors including media moguls Leo J. Hindery and Steven C. Markoff.Markoff, who donated to Sanders  2012 Senate campaign, began trading rare coins when he was 11. By 2004, his company A-Mark Entertainment was listed as the 65th largest privately held company in the U.S., and the second largest in Los Angeles.Hindrey, managing partner of the private equity fund InterMedia Partners and former chief executive of AT & T Broadband and of the YES Network, also maxed out on contributions to Sanders. Hindrey, while advocating for fewer tax breaks for the wealthy, is among the biggest Democratic fundraisers in the country.Another big money donor to Sanders  campaign is David Geffen, co-founder of DreamWorks Animation and worth a cool $6.9 billion. According to campaign finance records, Geffen donated the max at the time   $2,500   to Sanders Senate campaign on Jan. 27, 2012.But Lara Brown, director of George Washington University s political management program, told FoxNews.com that she doesn t see a big push-back from Sanders supporters. By and large, Democrats tend to believe these individuals are giving because they have a strong progressive/liberal orientation in their politics and they are doing this because it equates to them giving to a cause,  she said, adding that the same would be true for big-money donors in Silicon Valley and the tech industry.Via: FOX News ",

The suspect, who has not been confirmed as a Muslim but is named after the religion s prophet and is said to be of North African descent, was wearing camouflage when he was arrested. Belgian security forces found a rifle as well as bladed weapons in a car driven by a Frenchman who tried to ram a crowd on Thursday in the port city of Antwerp.

One of those celebrities was U2 s lead singer, Bono.For many, Bono s part in the video was even more controversial because he attempted to link the death of 9 black church members in South Carolina, who died while conducting a bible study at the hands of a young racist man, Dylann Roof, (who has since been sentenced to death for his heinous crime) with white cops who have killed blacks and have been found not guilty of intentional murder.The video doesn t just shine a light on injustices by white police officers, it promotes an atmosphere of hate and distrust for white people in America.It seems rather unusual that after U2 s Bono would cancel his concert in St. Louis that was scheduled for tonight, following a night of violent protests that led to the breaking of windows in the St. Louis Mayor s home (who supports BLM) and the shutting down of traffic for  safety  reasons.

Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Pat Roberts of Kansas are up in arms about reports that the Pentagon is scouting sites in their home states to house terrorist prisoners currently detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We have received reports of President Obama s attempt to shut down Guantanamo Bay, which once again reflects another egregious overstep by this administration,  Roberts said in a statement on Friday, referring to the law preventing transferring any of the inmates to a U.S. prison. Congress has consistently stopped Obama by law from moving a single detainee to the U.S.,  Roberts said in reaction to reports that Kansas s Fort Leavenworth is being considered as the terrorist suspects  new home. I shut down this administration s nominee for secretary of the Army in 2009 to prevent moving any detainees to Kansas and will do it again if necessary,  he said.  Not on my watch will any terrorist be placed in Kansas. Graham was equally emphatic upon learning that Defense Secretary Ash Carter is also considering Charleston for the new high-risk installation. If the detainees need to be moved, they must be moved to a maximum security location in a remote area far from heavily populated areas with vital infrastructure,  Graham told the Washington Post earlier this week.  Charleston does not meet that criteria.

        "text": "Yeah, because taking Trump down is more important to these flame throwers on the left (and right) than exposing the truth about Obama s  overt allegiance to Muslims living in America and the actual Muslim training camps that are taking place across America right now.Donald Trump pulled out of a Republican gathering in South Carolina Friday as he took hits from members of both parties for failing to correct a questioner who said President Obama is a Muslim. Mr. Trump has a significant business transaction that was expected to close Thursday. Due to the delay he is unable to attend today s Heritage Action Presidential Forum,  Trump s campaign announced in a release Friday.Trump had been scheduled to join most of the Republican field at the meeting of the influential conservative group.Trump drew condemnation Friday from some of his rivals for his failure to confront the questioner at a New Hampshire town hall who had labeled the president a Muslim, asked what he would do to  get rid  of Muslims and mentioned Islamic  training camps. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told NBC Friday,  I wouldn t have permitted that. If someone brought that up at a town hall meeting of mine, I would ve said,  No, listen. Before we answer, let s clear some things up for the rest of the audience. And I think you have an obligation as a leader to do that. If that person had been in my event I would have called him out in it,  Hillary Clinton said at a press conference after a campaign event in New Hampshire. Not only is it out of place and wrong it is totally factually untrue.  Sen. Bernie Sanders demanded that Trump apologize for  continuing the lie that the president is not an American and not a Christian. FOX News   Hidden in a remote area off a primitive dirt road lies a mysterious 70-acre compound in which more than 100 Muslims live in seclusion, following the teachings of its founder, a radical cleric with alleged ties to terrorism.It s neither a Taliban stronghold outside Jalalabad, nor an extremist madrassa on the outskirts of Karachi.It s a place called Islamberg, a closed and seemingly quiet community at the foot of the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York, about three hours north of Manhattan.It s also a compound shrouded in local rumors, mystery   and fear   sitting near the huge reservoir system that provides New York City with most of its drinking water.Quietly nestled in the woods, Islamberg remained unnoticed for the two decades leading up to Sept. 11, 2001, when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked by a determined band of Islamic extremists.That s when people started questioning the community s ties to a Pakistani cleric allegedly connected to worldwide terrorism. They also started talking about the unusual sounds of gunfire and explosions some said they heard emanating from the compound.But before you leap to conclusions and head to the Catskills to personally fight the war on terror   you need to know the entire story. The truth, as is often the case, is a lot more complicated than the headlines suggest.Islamberg got its start about 20 years ago, when   inspired by the words of the Sufi cleric Sheikh Syed Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani   a group of primarily black Muslims from Brooklyn left New York City to escape crime, poverty and racism. Aiming to lead what they believed was a peaceful and holy Muslim life, they built a community of some 40 family houses, their own grocery store and a bookstore.And they weren t alone. Other groups, also inspired by Gilani, have set up similiar communities in 19 other states. According to the group s own Web site, the Islamberg community is still  struggling,  and is asking for donations to complete its mosque.According to locals, the land previously belonged to a Deposit, N.Y., woman who opened up her home in the in the late 1970s or early  80s to disadvantaged youths from the city so that they could avoid being led astray by a financially and morally bankrupt urban environment.Those boys, according to locals who were friendly with some of the group, eventually went on to form Islamberg, and at some point they were joined by another group of more militant Muslims, who created something of a rival faction within the community.The group lived quietly there for years with little interaction with the local communities except for forays into town for supplies or to sell baked goods at the weekly flea market. Some of the men had jobs at a local credit-processing center or working for the Port Authority in New York City (where they are said to maintain a residence near a bridge that runs between two boroughs).In the few instances when they did have relationships with the locals, they were almost always friendly, many said. Sometimes local children would visit their friends in the compound. There was a sense of camaraderie with them,  one woman said.Watch video here:There was a notable exception, a situation involving the local schools in the late 1990s when some of the Islamberg boys got into a scuffle with local boys. They broke my nephew s nose,  said a Hancock, N.Y., woman, who asked that her name not be used.Another man said the Muslim boys  trashed  the school in Deposit.Locals variously blamed the fighting on an angry attitude on the part of the Muslim boys, racism on the part of the local boys or the  usual  relatively trivial events that lead almost all teenage boys into a confrontation at one point or another in their lives.According to Joy Felber, 62, a retired taxidermist who s lived in Deposit for 19 years, the cause lay with a group of local boys who picked a fight with the Muslims. We had some young boys in town who were causing trouble   not from the Muslim community   but they were antagonizing the boys in the Muslim community,  Felber said.  It was lack of knowledge. When people don t know other people, they have a tendency to lash out. And you put two teenage boys together and sparks fly. After a further controversy about whether the Islamberg boys should have been going to public school in Deposit or Hancock (the compound lies on the border between the two towns, and even longtime residents differ on whether it s technically in Deposit, Hancock or nearby Tompkins), the boys were pulled from the schools and the Muslim community drew away from town life.All Islamberg children are now schooled on the compound in a school that, according to one report, has a total of 62 students.",

        "title": " Foreign Diplomats Scared Sh*tless Over The Idea Of A President Trump",
        "text": "As we know, the final United Nations General Assembly of President Obama s presidency is occurring in New York City this week. That gave diplomats from around the world to weigh in on this year s very strange presidential election. Many seem rather rattled about the idea of a Donald Trump presidency, while others merely poked fun at Trump s buffoonery.One diplomat mocked Trump, saying,  he s a clown.  Another said,  He s nuts.  Yet another said that Trump is an  untrustworthy egomaniacal equivocator. Well, it s too bad so many American citizens can t see these traits in Trump. An Ipsos poll that polled foreign ambassadors who are currently working in America has 60 percent of these people saying they would vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton if they were citizens, while only 7 percent would hop on the Trump Train. That in and of itself is very telling.Dennis Jett, who spent much of his career being a diplomat himself and now works for Pennsylvania State University School of International Affairs, says that Trump s behavior has made many diplomats nervous and worried about American leadership, America s role in the world. Also curious is the fact that the American people have succumbed to the belief that Hillary is untrustworthy, while 93 percent of those surveyed in the Ipsos poll say that they find Hillary to be  somewhat  or  very much  in the realm of someone who they feel they can trust. On the other hand, just two in five of those surveyed say that they trust Trump  a little  while the rest said they don t trust him as far as they can throw him.German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier says that Trump is a  hate preacher  and alluded to the idea that the billionaire tycoon reminds him of demagogues from past times in his own homeland. French President Fran ois Hollande says that the GOP nominee s excesses make you want to retch. One lobbyist familiar with the diplomatic community says that there are deepening fears around the world regarding the idea of Trump making it to the White House. Speaking anonymously, the lobbyist said: Foreign clients are very concerned about what they perceive as a tipping point in this election. This is less about Democrat versus Republican, and more about open versus closed economy, vis- -vis the rest of the world. With a wave of nationalism and protectionism sweeping the West, there is a real concern it will take hold in the United States and in what form it might show itself post-election.Whether it s immigration reform or trade policy, it feels as if much of the world is opening while the U.S. is teetering on closing. Even more alarming, the diplomats say, is Trump s  America First  and isolationist demagoguery. Stephen Walt, who works as a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, says of the situation among diplomats: First and most obviously, most foreign governments would like a relatively predictable post-November situation, and I think they regard Trump correctly as a giant leap in the dark.Whatever Hillary Clinton s strengths or weaknesses might be, she has been a very conventional politician, at least when it comes to foreign policy. Therefore, people don t anticipate any kind of radical turn if she s elected. Of course, another source of more than a little concern is Trump s penchant for starting public feuds with longtime allies of the United States, as well as his public musings that he might not honor alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)   which is the single most important military alliance that we have developed since the horrors of World War II.In other words, the entire world is afraid of Donald Trump. Why aren t the American people able to see how dangerous this demagogue is? Donald Trump could single-handedly destroy the world with the power of the presidency.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",

        "text": "According to the NRA,  good guys with guns  across the nation are the last line of defense between some unspecified threat that could occur anywhere at any time, and something else. But who will protect the world from the  responsible gun owners  who prove themselves to be anything BUT responsible?In the latest instance of  responsible gun ownerness,  a Utah man found himself beaten to a pulp by people who were leaving a party at his home after he shot his girlfriend. According to ABC4 Utah, everyone was enjoying the all-night party until the unnamed man began fighting with his significant other. Overcome by emotion, he  responsibly  pulled out a handgun and demanded that partygoers leave his home.Obviously, confronted by a presumably drunk individual who thinks a gun is the best way to get people to leave a party, those present quickly left   but as they were in the driveway, they heard gunshots. Unified Police Department spokesperson Lex Bell says that the heroic individuals rushed back inside and pummeled the shooter, who left his victim with gunshot wounds to her ankle and hand, until he was unconscious.In an apparent effort to protect the shooter, the girlfriend told police that she  accidentally  shot herself while cleaning the gun   but law enforcement says that she was likely shot while trying to wrestle the gun away from her violent and crazy significant other. A friend who drove her to the hospital confirmed that her story was false. Fortunately, her injuries are not serious, though she may need surgery on her hand.According to area residents, the couple recently moved into the neighborhood   and after learning about their new neighbors, they are a bit concerned. One man, identified as  Dan,  called the incident  troublesome  because he has a family whose safety is placed at risk by the new  responsible gun owners  in the neighborhood.No charges have yet been filed, but Bell says that those who rushed in and heroically beat the living hell out of the shooter were likely, legally, justified.Watch a report on the attack below:Featured image via screengrab",

We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism, to a policy of globalism   focusing on how to make money for large corporations. She believes she is entitled to the office. She gets rich making you poor. It s not just our economy that s been corrupted, but our foreign policy too. The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives, trillions of dollars, and unleashed ISIS across the world. Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world. Libya was cooperating, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence, Syria was under control, ISIS wasn t even on the map. https://youtu.be/xUW2-MUonbo?t=35m6s .

Anderson posted the note on Twitter.@flotus Dear Melania, Thank you for your sweet note. It is heartwarming to see you manage your position with such beauty and grace. Pamela pic.twitter.com/h9mmdqxp0h  Pamela Anderson (@pamfoundation) May 3, 2017By contrast, here is Trump s signature.Image via Quartz Media.While the two signatures aren t identical, they both share some pretty striking similarities.As handwriting expert Sheila Kurtz told Yahoo,  Hers looks just like his, which is absolutely amazing. Both signatures have been described as spiky with thick black lines.There has been speculation about the unusual likeness, with Uproxx s Kimberly Ricci writing,  Is President Trump answering his wife s letters? Did he sign this letter and keep the coat as a fancy bathrobe? Is he a fan of Baywatch? Lots of questions need to be answered here. Source: AOLTwitter didn t miss the similarities either:@pamfoundation @FLOTUS You ve been duped. It appears Donald Trump signed it for Melania.

Now he s posing as his wife?  kendal unruh (@unruhkendal) May 5, 2017There are several possible explanations, and all but one should send chills down the spines of feminists:1. He is signing her name   That would either indicate that Melania is completely illiterate, and even I don t believe that, or that she married a complete control freak. Either way, doesn t he have something better to do than micromanage his wife s communications?2. It s a stamp or a computer simulation   While this is the most likely scenario, it s only slightly less disturbing. If so, he clearly instructed someone to create a signature that was just.like.his. so his wife would only be seen as an extension of him and his gawdawful style. He s like one of those husbands who insists on a joint Facebook page.3. She has been trained to have a signature that looks just like his   Gross.4. She actually has a signature that looks just like his.

        "text": "Things didn t go as well as Nicholle had hoped and now, she s lashing out at the owner of the billboard company who was inundated with calls from angry residents.Rouse & Revolt owner Nicholle Lewis told Newsweek that she didn t sleep much last night. Her phone wouldn t stop going off with the persistent buzzing of death threats for her sign, which stylizes the number 45 into a swastika and features Trump posed in a Hitler-esque stance. I m living in a small, podunk red town and I m already getting death threats,  said Lewis, whose store is in right-leaning Chico, population 90,000.  My business has completely floundered. Overnight I had more one-star reviews than all the reviews I ve received in a year. The sign was up for less than 24 hours before Stott Outdoor Advertising took it down amid a backlash that featured online attacks.But Lewis said she s standing behind her beliefs. I don t necessarily think that just because I m a business doesn t mean I can t mix my beliefs,  Lewis said.  That s a common misconception that you can t mix politics and business.   I have a platform and I m going to use it. Lewis has used the billboard at the corner of Third Avenue and Mangrove Avenue all year, though this is the first time she s made it political. He is not presidential, he is not a president,  Lewis said.  He is a celebrity who was born into money. And he s a Nazi sympathizer. I am going to stand behind my beliefs regardless. Lewis said she has been getting some support, too.Lewis got slammed by bad reviews on her store, Rouse and Revolt Facebook page, as well as her personal Facebook page, where she posted this video. In the video, Lewis pleas with liberals to make false claims against the sign company, as a payback because she s been hit with bad reviews. That s called liberal logic, in case you re not familiar with how liberal operate.Watch, as angry liberal Nicholle Haber Lewis threatens the sign company with a lawsuit while simultaneously asking libs to help her destroy his business.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.10\";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Posted by Nicholle Haber Lewis on Friday, October 6, 2017The general manager of Stott Outdoor Advertising replied to Newsweek:Jim Moravec, the general manager of Stott Outdoor Advertising, told Newsweek that the company took it down because  a lot of people misinterpreted the billboard and who the speaker was.

        "text": "As the Democratic Primary wraps up and tensions continue to flare, Capitol Hill Democrats are quietly discussing a possible coup to oust DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.Wasserman-Schultz, who has been seen as wildly divisive in the primary, is facing a mountain of criticism and uphill battles as she braces for a tough primary fight in Florida.According to an exclusive, in depth report from The Hill, Democratic Senators have been meeting together to draw up a plan to force the Florida Congresswoman to resign. One Democratic Senator, who is pro-Clinton and who remained anonymous, told The Hill: There have been a lot of meetings over the past 48 hours about what color plate do we deliver Debbie Wasserman-Schultz s head on. I don t see how she can continue to the election. How can she open the convention? Sanders supporters would go nuts. It s worth noting that these Democratic lawmakers couldn t actually oust Wasserman-Schultz; only the National Committee could do that, and would rely on talks between Clinton and Sanders.Another Democratic Senator echoed these sentiments, saying if the party hopes to attract young people, Wasserman-Schultz must go: We need to get this figured out and come together. Hillary s got the nomination. She needs Bernie s energy. It s time for her to accommodate. It s time to pick hard-nosed people to cut through things and figure out a deal. They [young people] need to know this is their party. However, not all Democratic Senators are cooling to Wasserman-Schultz. Senator Barbara Mikulski, who is retiring at the end of this term, said the Congresswoman has done a good job,  and said,  If you look at her platform committee appointments, she really gave a lot of room to Bernie supporters. Senators Bill Nelson, Tim Kaine, Kirsten Gillibrand, Jeanne Shaheen, and others have gone on record with The Hill vehemently denying the attempted coup and pledging their support. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and House Democratic Chair Xavier Baccara have also expressed their support for the DNC Chairwoman.The only member of he Senate to endorse Sanders, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, has remained neutral, but chastised Wasserman-Schultz for  adding gasoline to the fire  after the contentious and disastrous Nevada convention.An aide to Joe Biden told The Hill that the Vice President supports her.The issue surrounding Debbie Wasserman-Schultz continues to divide Democrats with roughly two months to go until the national convention in Philadelphia.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",

        "text": "Since 1945, the United States has been a crucial member of the United Nations, and a leader on the world stage. If Republicans have their way, however, that will end.Republicans in Congress have been whining about the United Nations for decades, and now that Donald Trump has taken over the White House, they are starting the process to force American withdrawal from the peacekeeping organization.Why?Because Trump and Republicans are mad that the United Nations condemned Israel for building illegal settlements on Palestinian land. In other words, Republicans are whining because they think the United Nations works for the United States instead of the entire world. Just as Trump thinks everything is about him, Republicans think international relations should be all about the United States.So, GOP Rep. Michael Rogers has filed The American Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2017 to formally withdraw the United States from the United Nations, which would effectively create a power vacuum within the international body that the Russians and Chinese will seek to fill.Without American influence, which we have had since the organization s founding, we will be left behind as the world moves on without us. Either that, or international cooperation will collapse entirely and throw the world into chaos as nations follow the United States and adopt isolationist policies that will ultimately lead to global wars. The United Nations was created to prevent such large scale conflicts in the first place, which is why we have avoided a World War III.The bill specifically directs Trump to  terminate all membership by the United States in the United Nations, and in any organ, specialized agency, commission, or other formally affiliated body of the United Nations. And that means the United States would also be withdrawing from the World Bank, the International Court of Justice, the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the International Atomic Energy Agency, among many others.Not only would America be going it alone, withdrawal would affect our ability to keep wannabe nuclear powers like Iran in check without starting a war. Our withdrawal from international financial institutions could have a devastating effect on the world economy, including our own.The United Nations would also have to move headquarters out of the United States, which would be a humiliating loss of international prestige.For decades, the world has looked to the United States for leadership and cooperation. But Republicans apparently want America to withdraw from the world stage   a move that would erase all the progress made over the last seven decades, and tarnish our reputation forever.This cannot be allowed to happen. This country has worked too hard to bring democracy and peace to the world to quit now. We should be leaders on the world stage, not isolationists.Featured image via Wikimedia",

        "title": "GUT WRENCHING: OBAMA Meets With Rappers To Discuss Criminal Justice Reform\u2026Doublespeak For Pardoning Criminals, Investigating Cops",
        "text": "Is there any question what Obama s priorities are in his final 8 1/2 months in office? His legacy will most certainly be that of the most divisive President (and First Lady) to ever occupy the White House. Every law enforcement officer in America should be concerned about his obsession with taking them down a few notches.President Obama is meeting with a group of music stars on Friday to discuss his push for criminal justice reform and his initiaitve dedicated to helping young men and boys of color.Rappers Busta Rhymes, Common, J. Cole, Wale, Ludacris and Chance the Rapper are all attending the meeting, according to a senior administration official.The meeting comes as Obama is trying to beef up support for the My Brother s Keeper Initiative, which is designed to help young African-Americans get an education, college degree and job training.Obama and his supporters launched a nonprofit group last May that will allow the president to continue the work once he leaves office.The president has also tried to keep momentum behind a bipartisan coalition looking to pass legislation in Congress that would reduce prison sentences for many non-violent drug offenders. Senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and My Brother s Keeper task force chairman Broderick Johnson also attended the meeting.War On Cops: President Obama says his  criminal justice reform    doublespeak for pardoning criminals and investigating cops   is gaining bipartisan support. New FBI crime data should stop the movement in its tracks.Last fall, we argued that Obama s war on police, prosecuted with the help of his Black Lives Matter goons, sparked a  national crime wave.   Violent criminals are getting the upper hand as the  Ferguson effect  takes hold in cities across the country,  we noted.  Less-aggressive policing has emboldened the bad guys, leading to a nationwide spike in murder. Officers fear violating softer new use-of-force and arrest policies, pushed on cities by the Obama Justice Department, will open them up to civil-rights prosecution. Many have backed off patrols and stops in dangerous urban areas as a result. The result: Year-over-year homicide rates are up 76% in Milwaukee; 60% in St. Louis; 56% in Baltimore; 44% in Washington, D.C.; 22% in New Orleans; 20% in Chicago; 20% in Kansas City; and 17% in Dallas. Single-digit rises have been seen in New York and other cities. Soon after, FBI Director James Comey indicated that spiking murder rates may be partly due to the  Ferguson effect    police reluctance to carry out their duties over fear of being investigated for abuse or discrimination, or shot by angry thugs in the line of duty.Police chiefs echoed his concerns, prompting the attorney general to gather major police chiefs and mayors together in Washington for a crime summit. It was supposed to be a closed meeting, no press allowed.But a Washington Post reporter snuck in and recorded Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel complaining that all the vitriol thrown at cops had put them in a  fetal  position. Obama s former chief of staff said they were backing off crime in gang-infested areas of his city.Obama pooh-poohed the city-by-city reports of climbing murder rates, arguing that there wasn t any aggregate data to show a national trend. But now we have the national data from the FBI. It confirms that the U.S. murder rate shot up 6.2% in the first half of 2015 from a year earlier. The spike reverses a three-year downtrend.Overall violent crime   murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault   rose almost 2%, in contrast to a nearly 5% drop in the comparable period of 2014. Violent crime rose in all but one of the nation s four regions, the FBI said, and all but two city groupings.If liberal pundits and politicians want to stop soaring crime rates, they should stop vilifying cops. And they should start speaking out against the Black Lives Matter race-mongers and their  criminal-justice reforming  patrons in the White House. ",

Who wants to support anything this snarky woman promotes? The rude comments go on and on First Lady Melania Trump wasted no time in responding. We give her credit she called it exactly what it was:  attention-seeking and self-serving noise Ivana Trump said she should be considered the  first lady  because she was President Trump s first wife, prompting a stinging rebuke from third wife and current first lady Melania Trump that the remark was  attention-seeking and self-serving noise. Ivana, the mother of Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric, said she has a line to the White House but tries not to call Trump too often because it makes Melania Trump jealous Ouch!Ivana Trump to @arobach: I don't like to call POTUS at the White House: \"I don't want to cause any kind of jealousy\" https://t.co/SiTlUUDX2S pic.twitter.com/nyvSj3Wk9O  Good Morning America (@GMA) October 9, 2017THE FACT THAT IVANA THINKS SHE WOULD CAUSE ANY JEALOUSY IS LAUGHABLE! I have the direct number to White House, but I no really want to call him there because Melania is there,  Ivana told ABC s  Good Morning America  during an interview on Monday.  I don t want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that because I m basically first Trump wife. MELANIA WASTED NO TIME RESPONDING: Mrs. Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the President. She loves living in Washington, DC, and is honored by her role as first lady of the United States. She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books,  spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement to CNN.  There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex, this is unfortunately only attention-seeking and self-serving noise. Ivana Trump, 68, who married Donald Trump in 1977 and divorced him in 1992, has been making the rounds of talk shows to promote her memoir,  Raising Trump,  which was published on Tuesday.WHAT A B*TCH! IVANA THINKS IT MUST BE  TERRIBLE  FOR MELANIA TO BE IN WASHINGTONDespite her comment that she should could carry the mantle of  first lady,  Ivana Trump said she really wouldn t be happy in the White House and wouldn t be willing to change places with Melania. I think for her to be in Washington must be terrible,  Ivana Trump said.  It s better her than me. I would hate Washington. IVANA TAKES A SHOT AT MELANIA!But then she took a veiled shot at the first lady s White House role. Would I straighten up the White House in 14 days? Absolutely. Can I give the speech for 45 minutes without [a] teleprompter? Absolutely. Can I read a contract? Can I negotiate? Can I entertain? Absolutely. But I would not really like to be there. I like my freedom,  she said.Ivana also takes  full credit  for raising their three children because he was  on the telephone making the deals. He was a loving father, don t get me wrong, and he was a good provider, but he was not the father which would take a stroll and go to the Central Park or go play to baseball with them or something,  she said,  It was only until they were about 18 years old [that] he could communicate with them, because he could start to talk business with them.

        "text": "For more than 30 years, Donald Trump has built himself up as being a great negotiator and a great leader. Unfortunately, as Special Investigator Robert Mueller is likely to prove soon, Trump is the emperor with no clothes. He wields almost no power, even as president. He is 100 percent on the pocket of Russian President Vladimir Putin and if you aren t convinced yet, this should do it for you.Putin is punishing the United States for the sanctions against him by cutting 755 embassy workers. Instead of retaliating (as he would with pretty much anyone from Rosie O Donnell to Kim Jong Un), Trump instead thanked Putin.A week ago, Congress voted nearly unanimously to send Russia a message by passing a bill enacting strict sanctions against them. The sanctions are about the country s interference in our 2016 election and for its brutal aggression against the Ukraine and Syria and they hit Putin where it hurts.The Russian sanctions will target people and entities that:   undermine US cybersecurity on behalf of the Russia government   invest certain amounts in Russia s energy export pipelines   conduct  significant  transactions with Russian defense and intelligence agencies (though this will come into effect six months from now)   commit, or assist in, serious human rights abuses   commit acts of  significant  corruption   provide support to the Syrian government to acquire arms   invest, or facilitate the investment of, $10 million or more in the Russian government s privatization of any state-owned asset in a one-year period that could unfairly benefit government officials or their associates.Source: CNNIn other words, the sanctions directly target the people who are holding and even laundering Putin s money.Sanctions were also handed to North Korea and Iran.Russia s hands are somewhat publicly tied, but after expelling 755 diplomats, Trump s reaction was beyond strange. He looked up mid-felatio and thanked the dictator. I want to thank him because we re trying to cut down our payroll   I m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll,  Trump told reporters Thursday at his New Jersey golf club.Source: CNBCEven that is a lie.

        "title": " 50 Top Republicans Pen BRUTAL Letter Warning Trump Would Be A National Security Disaster",
        "text": "Donald Trump is nigh-universally recognized as a walking, talking, national security disaster. From The Donald s promise to our allies that we can t be trusted if he becomes President, to his threat to essentially throw out the Iran nuclear deal by modifying it until it is meaningless, to his almost salivating over the thought of pushing the  big red button  and unleashing our nuclear arsenal on, presumably, the first world leader to make him angry on Twitter, The Donald has succeeded in getting himself ranked as one of the top 10 global security risks.It s gotten to the point that fifty top Republican officials have now signed a letter acknowledging that Trump would put at risk our country s national security and well-being.  According to these Republicans, many of whom were top aides or cabinet members for George W. Bush (so they are well aware that a President can be a top national security risk), Trump lacks the character, values and experience  to be President and that he would be the most reckless president in American history.  The NY Times reports:The letter says Mr. Trump would weaken the United States  moral authority and questions his knowledge of and belief in the Constitution. It says he has  demonstrated repeatedly that he has little understanding  of the nation s  vital national interests, its complex diplomatic challenges, its indispensable alliances and the democratic values  on which American policy should be based. And it laments that  Mr. Trump has shown no interest in educating himself. None of us will vote for Donald Trump,  the letter states, though it notes later that many Americans  have doubts about Hillary Clinton, as do many of us. Among the most prominent signatories are Michael V. Hayden, a former director of both the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency; John D. Negroponte, who served as the first director of national intelligence and then deputy secretary of state; and Robert B. Zoellick, another former deputy secretary of state, United States trade representive and, until 2012, president of the World Bank. Two former secretaries of homeland security, Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, also signed, as did Eric S. Edelman, who served as Vice President Dick Cheney s national security adviser and as a top aide to Robert M. Gates when he was secretary of defense.Robert Blackwill and James Jeffrey, two key strategists in Mr. Bush s National Security Council, and William H. Taft IV, a former deputy secretary of defense and ambassador to NATO, also signed. He is unable or unwilling to separate truth from falsehood,  the letter says.  He does not encourage conflicting views. He lacks self-control and acts impetuously. He cannot tolerate personal criticism. He has alarmed our closest allies with his erratic behavior. All of these are dangerous qualities in an individual who aspires to be president and commander in chief, with command of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Many of the signatories declined to add their names to a similar letter in March, but say Trump s promise that Russia would be  rewarded  for hacking his political enemies and his vow to be selective with which allies we defend caused many to change their minds.John B. Bellinger III, who served as Ms. Rice s legal adviser at the National Security Council and the State Department and who drafted the letter, says that  some  of the signers  will vote for  Clinton, and some will not vote, but all agree Trump is not qualified and would be dangerous. Trump indeed would be dangerous, not just to our allies but to average Americans thanks to his proposed Muslim ban and his unabashed attempts to prop up the Ku Klux Klan by warmly embracing their support   among, of course, other things.You can read the full letter below:  Donald Trump National Security Letter by German Lopez on ScribdFeatured image via Getty Images/Scott Eisen",

        "text": "Stories like these shine a light on how early our educators are indoctrinating our students. A third-grader said he s standing up for his First Amendment rights after he left school early Thursday because administrators ordered him to remove his pro-Donald Trump hat.Logan Autry s family took him out of Powers-Ginsburg Elementary School early Thursday amid controversy over his red  Make America Great Again  hat   signed by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee himself, a local ABC News affiliate reported. Logan had worn the hat several days in a row during recess and more and more classmates started picking on him. I still want to keep my hat. It s not the hat that draws attention, it s just my personality that the other children do not like,  Logan told ABC News in a tearful interview.School administrators determined the hat was causing a safety concern on campus and instructed Logan to take it off, which he refused. The vice principal came up to me and told me to take my hat off because it brings negative attention from other students. And I said no a few times and then the principal told me again and I still said no and refused,  he said.Logan said he loves politics, American history and Donald Trump. He likes to wear a shirt and tie to school and he practices speeches about Mr. Trump on the playground. I ve told them his policies on illegal immigration, and our Second Amendment, and our First Amendment and all of our amendments that need to be protected which are not going to be an amendment at all if Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders gets elected,  Logan said.  [Mr. Trump] doesn t speak like a politician. He speaks like a normal person. He knows what this country needs. Logan got the hat signed when he skipped school to attend a Trump rally last week, ABC News reported. I got to shake his hand and I felt his hair too, and it s actually real,  the boy told the station.  On the TV it looks not real, but it like, has a blur but when you see it in real life it looks a lot different. The Fresno Unified School District said in a statement that administrators acted appropriately. Our job as educators is to facilitate a safe learning environment where we encourage robust conversations of diverse and thoughts,  the statement said.  We are proud that in this case, our school achieved that goal by allowing the student to wear his hat for several days. However, it is also our responsibility to take precautions when the discourse begins to impact our school climate and interrupt school operations.  Via: Washington Times",

The magazine quotes him writing:  I gave immigration officials at the time in Cuneo (in Northern Italy) a fake date of birth. Instead of 31 December 1996 I was born on 14th of November 1987. His parent club Eintracht Frankfurt have posted a 100,000 EUR (75,000 GBP) bail for the player which meant he only spent one night in investigative custody before he was freed pending a trial over the rape allegation.The revelation means that instead of being treated by the juvenile court, his paperwork will now be handed over to the regular court where he will be considered an adult, and could face a much higher sentence if convicted. As a teenager he would have probably expected a suspended sentence, but as an adult he is likely to get three years if convicted. Via: UK ExpressHe ll receive a much higher sentence as an adult? Three years? That s the punishment for raping in Germany? Wow! No wonder rape is such a common occurrence with these  refugees. ",

He doesn t even have to spend money on advertising because huge networks give it away for free.And instead of trying to rein in the absurd status quo, MSNBC has shown signs that it will only get worse. Already the network tossed one of their fiercest liberal hosts, Melissa Harris-Perry, because they needed more time for Trump live feeds. They ve recently begun hinting that they will be expanding their conservative morning show, Morning Joe, in an effort to entice both Trump and his fans to check out the network. Host Joe Scarborough is a well known Trump fan making the relationship between the Republican candidate and the network even more inexcusable.Did the media  create  Donald Trump? The answer is complicated. Certainly, Trump s racist and sexist fans were already around, just waiting for a candidate to say all the right things to them. But there can be no question that the media has enabled Trump. Every phone interview. Every campaign rally. Every panel discussion about Trump s  viability  makes Trump s star rise. There is no such thing as bad publicity, and nobody gets publicity   good and bad   like Trump.Kudos to O Donnell for taking a stand against this betrayal of integrity.Featured image via screengrab",

        "text": "President Trump s deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka appeared on Anderson Cooper s 360 show, where he admonished the network for making up news about the Trump administration being  in crisis  and that they were in  bunker mentality  following the news story that broke about a June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian Lawyer who promised dirt on Hillary, but instead wanted to talk about Russian adoptions. Gorka told Cooper, It s laughable. Your chyron talked about a bunker mentality. I actually work in the West Wing, I work in the White House. It is absolutely nothing of the kind, Trump s Deputy Assistant continued,  We are pushing the  Make America Great Again  agenda, the president is a steam locomotive that cannot be stopped, it s just fake news. I m sad to see CNN fall to this. Gorka continued with his tongue-lashing of CNN s stone-faced host Cooper Anderson:  I know you want salacious, sensational coverage for your ratings, so your corporate sponsors and owners will have more money but that s not media, that s not reportage, it s just fake news. Cooper, remained surprisingly stoic as Gorka outed CNN s real agenda, which is clearly not reporting actual news, but instead, chasing ratings and ultimately money from advertisers. When Gorka appeared to be finished, Cooper replied,  Okay, I m just going to ignore the insults because I don t think it gets us anywhere.  Gorka quickly replied saying,  It s not about you, its about actually having journalism back on TV. Where are the Walter Cronkite s of yesteryear? This is just about ratings and money.

Instead of standing up our flag, or for his fellow veterans and the country he once fought so valiantly for, McCain took the cowardly way out and made a statement supporting the NFL player s right to disrespect our flag.

Tonight, libs went nuts over a picture that was taken of Kellyanne Conway in the Oval Office as she positioned herself on a couch (gasp with her shoes still on) while taking a group picture, as President Trump met with the leaders of the nation s historically black colleges and universities. Hmmm .maybe the anger wasn t really about Conway s shoes after all. Maybe the outrage is really more about the idea that President Trump met with a large group of prominent black leaders in the oval office. They couldn t attack the black leaders, so why not attack one of the most accomplished women in America?Things must be slow at the liberal rag Buzzfeed, as their DEPUTY NEWS DIRECTOR took to Twitter over his concern for Kellyanne Conway wearing her shoes while kneeling on the couch in the Oval Office:Shoes on the couch in the Oval Office pic.twitter.com/h2MXUocEar  Jon Passantino (@passantino) February 28, 2017And this from a Chicago Tribune columnist:I have so many questions about this photo, but chief among them is why nobody is telling Kellyanne Conway to get her damn feet off the couch pic.twitter.com/tU0CBS36Fe  Rex Huppke (@RexHuppke) February 28, 2017Here s our response to this clever tweeter who attempted to  imagine  if Hillary Clinton actually put her shoes up on the couch in the Oval Office.

        "text": "After ESPN fired washed-up MLB pitcher Curt Schilling, and rightfully so, for posting an extremely transphobic image on his Facebook page, he decided that wasn t enough hate, so now he s added some racism to the mix.Clearly pissed that he lost his job, Schilling decided to repost an image put out by conservative blogger and wannabe comedian Steven Crowder. In the image it throws noted writer and activist Shaun King under the bus in its pathetic attempt to be funny. Which, I m sure to the myopic, racist and transphobic crowd Crowder plays to, is hilarious.The image says: Liberal Logic:Shaun King: Fakes being a black man.

Here s the image: via FacebookNow anyone with half a brain knows that Shaun King, who has time and time again been accused of lying about his race, and has struggled through his own past to appease those who don t understand things that aren t as simple as black and white, is indeed a man of color speaking his own unique truth.But clearly, many conservatives, especially those like Crowder and Schilling who like to make fun of and are clearly afraid of anyone different from themselves, can t wrap their head around this sort of thing.And not only is Schilling not apologizing for his transphobic hatred that got him fired, he s now doubling down on it.As a diehard Boston Red Sox fan, who was proud during the bloody sock moments, I couldn t be more disgusted at this pathetic little scrap of a man who can t bring himself to basic human decency and recognize there are people on this planet who are, indeed, transgender.Schilling, at this point, delete your account.

        "title": " Obama Shamelessly Mocks Trump: \u2018Orange Is NOT The New Black\u2019 (VIDEO)",
        "text": "It s no secret that President Obama has a quick wit and a great sense of humor. Both were on full display on Thursday s edition of Jimmy Fallon s The Tonight Show, and the target of said wit and humor was GOP presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump. First, Fallon asked Obama his opinion on how the GOP felt about Trump being their nominee, and he said that the Democrats are happy about it, for sure. Then on a more serious note, the president went on to say: The truth is, actually I am worried about the Republican Party. I know that sounds   you know what it sounds like.The main role I m going to be playing in this process is to remind the American people that this is a serious job. This is not reality TV. Then the mockery resumed, this time aimed at the astoundingly stupid Republicans sitting in Congress who have made Trump their standard bearer. Obama said: Thank you, Congress, for spending eight years wishing you could replace me with a Republican. Or, to put it another way, how do you like me now? After that, the president reminded America just how much he has managed to do, how far he has pushed America in all the right directions, despite constant GOP obstruction during the entire tenure of his presidency: I m proud of the many progressive steps our country has taken in recent years, both socially and environmentally. The United States has been a leader in developing clean energy to ensure the health of our planet for future generations. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, an additional 20 million Americans now have access to quality health care, and same-sex couples across the country now have a constitutional right to marry. In short, climate change is real, health care is affordable and love is love. After that, the president got serious again for a second, and reminded us all what is at stake should Donald Trump take the White House: The American people face an important decision this fall. The entire world is watching, and they look to us for stability and leadership. I know some of the candidates have been critical of my foreign policy. I don t want to name any names, but I believe it is of the utmost importance to work alongside other world leaders. That s why I signed the Iran nuclear deal. That s why we reopened diplomatic ties with Cuba. And that s why I negotiated the new trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. That is when Jimmy Fallon asked President Obama his feelings on TPP, and the Commander-in-Chief did not mince words: Yeah, you know me. Look, Jimmy, the TPP allows American businesses to sell their products both at home and abroad. The more we sell abroad, the more higher paying jobs we have here at home. It s that simple. After that, things got funny again as the segment drew to a close, where Fallon asked what Obama thought of the Trump media circus. The president took a real shot at the GOP s incessant racist attacks against him, and, of course, Trump s own racism, when asked if he had been tuning in: No, but I have been watching my new favorite show,  Orange Is Not The New Black. Once again, President Obama shows himself to be a warm, down to earth, classy and adorably hilarious human being, despite being near the end of what is arguably the most difficult presidency in the history of America. He is right about Trump, and he is right to endorse Hillary Clinton in an effort to stop Trump. Most of all, though, he has not allowed anything that has been slung his way to make him lose his humanity and his sense of humor.Well done, Mr. President!

        "title": " Seth Meyers Takes Aim At GOP Voter Suppression Tactics (VIDEO)",
        "text": "Millions of Americans are at risk of not being allowed to vote in this year s presidential election because of voter suppression efforts by Republicans, and that did not sit well with Seth Meyers at all.During Wednesday night s edition of Late Night, Meyers took aim at restrictive voter ID laws that have caused absolute chaos during primaries in several states, in particularly Wisconsin and Arizona, where Republicans have enacted such laws in an effort to prevent Democratic voters from exercising their right and civic duty.On Tuesday, Wisconsin GOP state Rep. Glenn Grothman openly bragged that the voter ID he helped pass in his state would hurt Hillary Clinton in the general election. Hillary Clinton is about the weakest candidate the Democrats have ever put up and now we have voter ID and I think voter ID is going to make a little bit of a difference as well,  he said on national television as the law caused long delays and forced voters to wait in long lines. You re not supposed to say that out loud,  Meyers responded.  That s like a dude rolling up in a Corvette and saying,  You know, I bought this to compensate for my tiny penis. Meyers then moved on to North Carolina, where a sweeping GOP-passed anti-voting law has caused poll workers to make voting difficult for people who aren t white. During the North Carolina primary in March, poll workers forced an Asian couple to spell their names and made them wait to exercise their voting rights as white voters were allowed to breeze through the lines without a problem. Critics had warned in 2013 that the voter ID law would bring back Jim Crow era tactics, and it looks like they were right. That s terrible news for the nation s Kaileys,  Meyers quipped.  So many ways you can go, Kayleigh. This is America   the only time you should have to spell your own name is when you re screaming it on a call with Time Warner Cable. Then Meyers took aim at Arizona, where the worst voting fiasco has taken place thus far this year.Arizona Republicans slashed the number of polling places from 400 to 200 in 2012, which led to thousands of citizens waiting in line to vote for hours. Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell went ahead and cut that down to 60 just this year, resulting in an even longer wait to cast votes in a county with a population of four million. But that s not all. Misinformation was spread via the Secretary of State s website and hundreds of voters, mostly Democrats, had their party affiliation altered prior to the primary. Even Secretary of States Michele Reagan testified that election fraud occurred and Arizonans are calling for a federal investigation. If you ve been waiting in line so long the pizza place is willing to deliver to you, you re going to be frustrated,  Meyers remarked.  Is that a house or an apartment?   It s a line   I live in a line. Meyers ended the segment by pointing out that these voter ID laws could end up repeating the 2000 Election. You know, the nightmare election that forced George W. Bush upon America because the conservative-leaning Supreme Court stepped in to halt a recount that could have resulted in an Al Gore victory. And we all know what happened over the next eight years.Yeah, let s not do that again.Here s the video via YouTube: Featured Image: Screenshot",

        "text": "A desperate Jeb Bush held a campaign rally at a South Carolina golf course on Wednesday, and all his supporters wanted to do was give him advice on how to fix his struggling campaign.Bush was probably hoping to come out swinging as the South Carolina primary approaches, but his worried fans had different concerns.Like a child being advised on how to deal with being bullied, one Bush supporter named Edward Scott told Bush that he should  raise the bar  and rise above the bullying by Trump because his message is being lost the more Bush gets frazzled by the billionaire mogul. Your message doesn t resonate with the national community.   I was wondering because of your civility if you could raise the bar in the next session and try to be beyond the bully because I think that s who you are and I think they try to knock you off center. It appears you do get knocked off center, like anyone would, because of the insults to your family. I don t think I feel shaken up by the bully,  Bush replied.  I m the only guy going after the guy who I believe is hijacking the party. David Villinger also voiced concern about Trump taking over the race while Bush desperately focuses on attacking him instead of focusing on delivering his own message. I think the campaign has been co-opted by the P.T. Barnum of our time. And I think he is getting you off your good message and all the times that you ve shared with us today. But I think I would encourage you to emphasize those things. Indeed, Jeb Bush is currently polling in a distant fourth place behind Trump, who leads the field with 34 percent while Bush only has under 10 percent.Cruz clocks in at second place with 17 percent and Rubio is a close third place with 16 percent. Clearly, nobody is really all that excited about Jeb.In the end, Jeb Bush not only received advice, he got bad news because South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley endorsed Marco Rubio even after Jeb sent his brother to meet with her. Jeb could only give reporters some parting sarcasm. It s all been decided, apparently. The pundits have already figured it out. We don t have to go vote. I should stop campaigning maybe. And that s probably the best idea Jeb Bush has had throughout his entire campaign. Featured image from Flickr",

So sad  pic.twitter.com/GvTCs9fL7w  Subvert Trump (@_Robespierre__) January 6, 2017Trump may be tweeting about ratings, but he surely has a lot on his mind with the intelligence briefing. After all, he has maintained for months that he had secret information that proves Vladimir Putin s gang didn t hack his political enemies for him. He has repeatedly attacked our intelligence agencies for bringing it to light. As ABC reports, the proof that Trump was lying to the American people is quite strong:Overnight   just hours after President Barack Obama received the report   new details emerged of just what is contained in the secret document.A senior official briefed on the intelligence sources, methods and assessments in the report that Trump will receive this morning told ABC News that the findings are clear: the evidence points directly to the Kremlin and to Russian President Vladimir Putin in what one official described as  multiple streams and types of intelligence collection, not just forensic examinations of the hacked systems.  Those various streams of information gathered by U.S. spy agencies include signals intelligence such as intercepts of communications between Russian officials in which they implicated the Kremlin s own espionage, as ABC News reported last month.The Washington Post reported late on Thursday that the eavesdropping caught senior Russian officials actually cheering Trump s surprise victory in November as a success of the Kremlin s intelligence program.And Vice President Joe Biden   who was privy to the classified briefing that Trump will receive today   told the PBS NewsHour that,  there s overwhelming consensus in the community and overwhelming evidence supplied by the community that Russia did engage in an effort to impact on the elections. There is clear evidence that they in fact were engaged in activities designed to try and impact in the outcome of the election,  Biden said, while noting there was  no evidence that they actually tampered with voting booths or tampered with voting rolls. Referring to parts of the report which will be made public next week, Biden said:  It will state clearly that the Russians did as a matter of policy  attempt to  discredit the US electoral process  and  attempt to hurt Mrs. Clinton. Contrary to Trump s public bloviations Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, says that the attacks were approved at the highest level of government in Russia    and by that, he means that  the highest is President Putin. Recently, Barack Obama expelled more than 30 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the country. Vladimir Putin responded by saying he would wait to respond until his puppet   sorry, Trump   was officially President.Featured image via Getty Images (Andrew Renneisen)/screengrab",

        "text": " US paratrooper on security duty during a mission to train Iraqi forces (Photo: US Department of Defense. Source: Wikicommons)21st Century Wire says In southeastern Syria, the region around al-Tanf has quickly become a focal point for the ongoing conflict in the region. Near to both the Iraqi and Jordanian borders, al-Tanf is currently the location of a contingent of US-led coalition forces, supposedly there for the purpose of providing training to  anti-ISIS  militias, but also anti-Assad militias too   the fabled  moderate rebels . Not surprisingly, the US-led coalition has unilaterally imposed a self-styled  deconfliction zone  around their camp in al-Tanf and claim to be defending their position from  pro-Syrian forces , otherwise known as the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) and allied militias. It has been reported by mainstream media outlets that coalition members represented at al-Tanf include not only the United States but also the British SAS, and also possibly Norway too.Although coalition forces are also present in other parts of Syria, including the area around Raqqa, an ISIS stronghold, the last few weeks have seen coalition forces striking Syrian military targets on at least three occasions near the coalition training camp close to al-Tanf  including incidents on May 18th, June 6th and June 8th. It is now being reported that the US is supplying  truck-mounted long range missiles  to its forces near al-Tanf, in a move that risks immediate escalation in the already-tense situation, and despite diplomatic efforts by Russia to calm the situation. All this comes as the US and its Kurdish proxy militia, the SDF, mount their attack on the ISIS stronghold Raqqa in Northeast Syria. The US has also seized the opportunity to invade more Syrian territory after an alleged sarin gas attack on April 4th that prompted President Trump to launch a missile strike on a Syrian airbase in retaliation.In the following segment filmed two weeks ago, 21WIRE editor Patrick Henningsen speaks to RT International about the recent US strike on Syrian forces near al-Tanf. Henningsen explains how the US are taking advantage of the tension to secure its own territory inside of Syria:. US and Britain: A Policy of DeceptionOne could easily be confused by the narrative that is being spun by the US, Britain, and compliant mainstream media in both countries. Less than two years ago, in 2015, then British Prime Minister David Cameron ruled out sending British ground troops into Syria. In mid-2016, however, it emerged that British special forces were engaged in combat in the country. Between 2013 and 2015, former US President Barack Obama said on at least 16 occasions that there would be no boots on the ground  in Syria, but then changed his mind in late 2015 when US Special Forces were deployed into Syria.President Trump s statements are no less contradictory. On April 11th 2017, soon after his initial missile strikes on the Syrian airbase, Trump said that the US was  not going into Syria ; the current situation at al-Tanf simply contradicts that statement.Since that time, both Britain and the US have been slowly ramping up their presence in Syria, ostensibly to fight ISIS. But by repeatedly striking at Syrian government forces    the single most effective fighting force against ISIS    the US and Britain are actually helping ISIS to achieve its objectives.Note the mismatch between the US-led coalition s presence in Syria and how it s presented to the public. Not only do they claim to be fighting ISIS while at the same time indirectly helping them, but they also call their attacks on Syrian army targets  defensive   even though the Syrian military has never attempted to attack any coalition forces. And it is similarly ironic that these strikes against the Syrian military have occurred in what the coalition calls a  deconfliction zone , where supposedly no conflict is allowed. According to security analyst Charles Shoebridge: These are self-declared [US occupied] zones of  deconfliction.  What they really mean there is that they are not allowing other people to enter these zones, notwithstanding that this is part of a sovereign country, Syria  What they mean is that actually conflict is allowed, and military forces, as long as they are American, British and their  rebel  allies. They are not agreed deconfliction zones. Syria doesn t agree to them. Russia, which of course has established de-escalation zones elsewhere in the country, hasn t agreed to this. Consequently they really are, as [Russian Foreign Minister] Lavrov or his spokesman said, effectively unilateral zones. And not only is the narrative confusing, it is also not given the highest priority among mainstream headlines, with many other prominent stories conveniently serving to occupy the public while the situation in al-Tanf escalates. In a week that saw Congressmen shot at and injured at a baseball practice, a massive tower block fire in London taking at least 17 lives, and the UK election aftermath continuing to be unresolved, one could easily remain unaware of the escalating situation around al-Tanf in Syria. With the US-led coalition now directly and deliberately attacking Syrian forces, what has been a proxy war is suddenly growing more dangerous, and the prospect of a direct conflict between nuclear-armed powers looms ever closer.As former British Ambassador to Syria Peter Ford remarked during a recent conversation with 21WIRE, the British military has neither Syrian approval to be in Syria, nor international approval from the UN, nor even legislative approval from its own Parliament. The same applies to the United States; although the US Constitution gives the power to declare war exclusively to Congress, the US now has quite a long history of entering wars or using deadly military force without Congressional approval under the flexible guise of an  Authorization of Force. More on this story from Newsweek  Two Syrian army tanks destroyed in a battle against  moderate rebels , Azaz, Syria (Photo: Christiaan Triebert. Source: Wikicommons)Tom O Connor NewsweekRussia has demanded that the U.S. stop attacking forces that support the Syrian government as they overtake positions held by the Islamic State militant group (ISIS) on the country s border with Iraq.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reportedly made the comments Saturday on a phone call with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, responding to three U.S. air strikes in the past few weeks against forces battling ISIS and other insurgent groups on behalf of Russian-backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Pentagon has argued that the pro-Syrian government coalition, which it describes as Iran-backed militias, has breached a  deconfliction zone  declared by the U.S.-led international coalition in southern Syria but not recognized by Moscow or Damascus. Lavrov criticized the U.S. s moves, and the pair reportedly agreed to cooperate more closely in the future. Lavrov expressed his categorical disagreement with the U.S. strikes on pro-government forces and called on him to take concrete measures to prevent similar incidents in future,  Russia s Foreign Ministry said in a statement, according to Reuters.While the Syrian army and its allies, which include Russia, Iran and various pro-government militias, advance toward the besieged eastern city of Deir Al-Zour, held by ISIS since 2014, the U.S. has deployed Special Forces to train anti-Assad rebels near the southern region of al-Tanf. Both factions are involved in the battle against ISIS but differ on Syria s political future, with the former insisting that Assad remains in power and the latter mostly advocating for his removal.Continue this story at NewsweekREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire SYRIA FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",

        "text": "21st Century Wire says President Obama is once again appearing on  info-tainment  programming on Comedy Central but his appearance is clearly not to entertain or inform the viewer. In the final days of the President s time in office he is going on comedy shows to push the  Russian hack  effect on the U.S. Presidential election outcome. He does so without a shred of evidence nor a mention of the Podesta emails, the collusion of the media with the Clinton campaign or the questionable practices of the Clinton Foundation.The Duran asks some good questions and provides further analysis  Alex Christoforou The DuranObama has gone all in to blame Russia for Hillary Clinton s loss and the DNC hack that exposed Hillary Clinton for the corrupt cheat that we all knew, deep down inside, she truly was.Notice how Obama talks only about the DNC hack and not the Wikileaks Podesta email leak. Also notice how Obama tries to justify his conveniently timed call for an investigation, by throwing it back onto Donald Trump.Obama never states that he has irrefutable evidence that Russia hacked the DNC emails, and never even mentions once the Podesta emails We determined and announced in October that it was the consensus of all the Intelligence agencies in law enforcement that organizations affiliated with Russian intelligence were responsible for the hacking of the DNC materials that were being leaked. FYI China, Israel, Germany, etc  also hack US institutions. US intelligence agencies hack governments all over the world.Obama s above assertions are based on James Clapper s statement that The Duran reported on in October consider the statement US intelligence published last week on the subject of alleged Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and of other US agencies involved in the election. It reads as follows: The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there.We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. (bold italics added)The statement is an implicit admission that US intelligence has no evidence to back its allegations of Russian hacking.It is merely  confident    not  sure    that it is the Russians who are behind the hacking, and it is clear from the statement that it arrived at this conclusion purely through inference: because the hacks supposedly were  consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts .US intelligence assumes the Russians were behind the hack not because it knows this to be so but in part because of what it believes Russian motives to be.The statement backs its claim with a textual trick.  It says  the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia .  It then immediately follows these words with the words  for example .These lead to the expectation that an actual example of such Russian  tactics and techniques  is about to follow. Instead what is provided are the fact free words  to influence public opinion there .The words  for example  lend nothing to the meaning of the statement, which would be exactly the same without them.  These two words as used in the statement are actually meaningless.   That is a sure sign that their presence in the statement is intended to confuse the casual reader, and that this is true of the statement as a whole.The words are designed to create a subliminal impression to a casual reader that the Russians have been caught doing this sort of thing before, without however providing a single actual example when this was the case.Demonstrating how thin the case of Russian government actually is, the statement then goes on to say: Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government. (bold italics added)In other words US intelligence admits the mere fact servers operated by a Russian company may have been used for  scanning and probing    and presumably also for hacking   is not in itself proof of the involvement of the Russian government.The Daily Show s Trevor Noah, who is not a journalist, and not even American, is the perfect useful idiot to conduct this interview and help spread Obama s political spin.No tough question, no follow up questions just giggly gushing glances of admiration and awe from Noah.Remember when Obama told Trump to  stop whining  about a rigged election and focus on  getting votes. This was when Obama, and the entire Hillary liberal elite establishment, were certain that Trump had no chance to win the US Presidency.How things change, and how Obama is now changing his tune doing everything in his power to undermine Trump and undermine US Democracy, while risking escalating, already high tensions with Russia.Continue reading this story at The DuranREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",

        "title": "\u201cPROPHECY\u201d PROPAGANDA: Zionist Millennialism Refuted",
        "text": " Jay Dyer 21st Century WireDemonstrating where bad hermeneutics and theology lead, plus evidence of a continued conspiracy against historic Orthodox Christianity.Pastor John Hagee of the the large Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas has recently published a book,  In Defense of Israel,  in which he outlines in detail his own total apostasy from the most basic of Christian beliefs that Christ was the Messiah! See our posted video where he states it plain as day. But what is the root of this problem? I say several things. Aside from his own dubious character and obvious bad will, the cause can be found in bad hermeneutics. Hermeneutics is the science of interpretation how we interpret he texts of Sacred Scripture.SEE ALSO: The Holy Business: End-Times Buffoonery in a Modern WorldWhen I saw Hagee on the Glenn Beck Show a couple weeks ago talking about Israel non-stop, I knew something was going on. I used to use John Hagee s  Prophecy Study Bible as an idiot evangelical when I was 18 (several years ago), so I can speak from experience concerning Hagee (also having read some of his books and watched his  prophecy  lectures). END TIMES 2.0: Pastor John Hagee attempting to rapture his flock  (donor base) to the promise land after a possible nuclear Armageddon.  Let s examine some errors of the false hermeneutic of the premillennialists and evangelicals. The first error this entire system is built upon is the idea that Israel is still God s chosen covenant nation. God s promises to Abraham s descendants were purely literal and never able to be revoked, this view holds. God is bound in his eternal love to the literal nation of Israel, even though they have rejected Christ for the most part for the past 2000 years. However, historic Orthodox Christianity has always taught that the Church of Christ is the New Israel, the true bride of Christ, that faithfully keeps the testimony of Christ (Apoc. 12:17). Let s look at some texts that show this point:1. When we examine Christ s parable of the wicked vinedressers, we see an explicit statement from our Lord concerning the possession of the kingdom of God. Keep in mind, Hagee and all his evangelical &liberal friends think God has never, in any sense, revoked the old covenant with Israel, and that they are still the possessors or future possessors of His kingdom:Matt. 21:33:  Hear another parable: There was a certain landowner who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a winepress in it and built a tower. And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country. 34 Now when vintage-time drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive its fruit. 35 And the vinedressers took his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another. 36 Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did likewise to them. 37 Then last of all he sent his son to them, saying, They will respect my son. 38 But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves,  This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance. 39 So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.40 Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?  41 They said to Him, He will destroy those wicked men miserably, and lease his vineyard to other vinedressers who will render to him the fruits in their seasons. 42 Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures:The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone. This was the LORD s doing, And it is marvelous in our eyes.43 Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it. 44 And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.  45 Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking of them. 46 But when they sought to lay hands on Him, they feared the multitudes, because they took Him for a prophet. The parable is quite clear, and is explained by our Lord Himself. This was fulfilled when the Romans sacked Jerusalem in 70 A.D., and destroyed the Temple and its administration. This was the definitive end of the Old Testament dispensation, and fulfilled also the predictions of Luke 21. In response to the Jews, Christ says the kingdom of God will be taken from them because of the fact that they are going to murder him. Christ states unequivocally that the kingdom will be transferred to the Gentiles because of the rejection of Christ by the Jews.2. Our Lord commissioned the 12 Apostles to be the foundation stones of the New Israel, replacing what St. Paul calls  flesh Israel  or  Israel after the flesh. Luke 22:  28 But you [Apostles] are those who have continued with Me in My trials. 29 And I bestow upon you a kingdom, just as My Father bestowed one upon Me, 30 that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.So, our Lord has conferred upon the 12 the possession of the kingdom, and it is they and their successors (Luke 10:16, 1 Tim. 1:3-4), who will sit on thrones judging in this spiritual kingdom. Those who sit on these thrones are also their successors, the Bishops of the Church. This is why St. Paul can write in Eph. 2: 19 Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, 20 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone, 21 in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, 22 in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit. 3. Isn t it ironic that Hagee s church is named  cornerstone. It makes one wonder whether he meant Christ, the true cornerstone, or the Masonic  cornerstone  ceremony performed by masons at the erecting of a new lodge. And in case you think this is far fetched, consider what wikipedia states about Hagee in the entry under his name: Hagee was awarded the  Humanitarian of the Year  award by the San Antonio B nai B rith Council. It was the first time in the history of San Antonio that this award has been given to a Gentile. Dr. Hagee was presented the ZOA Israel Award by U.N. Ambassador Jean Kirkpatrick. This award was given by the Jewish Community of Dallas, Texas. He was presented the ZOA Service Award by Texas Governor Mark White. Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire issued a special proclamation in his honor declaring Pastor John C. Hagee Day. Hagee has received numerous honors and accolades from national Jewish organizations for his support of Israel. For those that don t know, B nai B rith equates with Jewish Freemasonry. Could Hagee be a Zionist agent? It seems so.4. In response, it is the Catholic Church, and she alone, that is the building of God, the temple of God, the New Jerusalem, that is the kingdom of God built upon the foundation stones of all the Apostles, and it is this kingdom which can never fall. She alone has lasted 2000 years without changing her doctrines and without committing massive apostasy. This is why we see the name of an Apostle and the name of a tribe on each of the 12 foundation stones of the New Jerusalem in St. John s Apocalypse (Apoc. 21). The Cathoic Church has never repealed, though it has qualified the meaning of the inspired words of St. Paul in 1 Thess. 2: 14 For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, just as they did from the Judeans, 15 who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they do not please God and are contrary to all men, 16 forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, so as always to fill up the measure of their sins; but wrath has come upon them to the uttermost. And Christ Himself has no fear of being labelled  anti-semitic  (though He was, of course a semite!) when he calls Judaism a  synagogue of Satan,  in Apoc. 2:9 & 3:9).5. Is this racism? Anti-semitism? Absolutely not. Arabs are  semites  as much as Jews, and there are and have been millions of Arab Christians. What we are concerned with opposing here is an occult, racist philosophy Zionism, which is just as bad as  white supremacy  or the Black Panthers  ideology. Only by being incorporated into the God-man and His Body, the Church, can these petty, fleshly divisions be overcome, as St. Paul writes in Galatians 3:28-29. There we learn that the true descendants of Abraham are those who operate with the faith of Abraham, not racist pride. John Hagee is, in fact, the racist, who now worships the nation of Israel. Without Christ, there is no salvation. The flesh nation of Israel is cut off from the covenant and cannot attain to heaven without faith in Jesus. Let us look at an important allegory from St. Paul on this matter.Galatians 4:21 Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? 22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman. 23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise, 24 which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar  25 for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children 26 but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. 27 For it is written:Rejoice, O barren, You who do not bear! Break forth and shout, You who are not in labor! For the desolate has many more children Than she who has a husband. 28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise. 29 But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now. 30 Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the forewoman. 31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free. 6. So, you see, there are only two covenants, and there have only ever been two covenants. One, symbolized by Mt. Sinai, which represents Judaism, and which cannot give life to those who seek to externally fulfill its precepts, and the New Covenant, which is the eternal covenant (Heb. 13:20), confirmed in the counsels of the Persons of the Trinity before the foundation of the world (Apoc. 13:8). This New Covenant is the covenant confirmed in Christ s Blood, which is the Eucharist celebrated at every Mass and Divine Liturgy throughout the world (Luke 22:20 with Jer. 31:31). The Old Testament saints themselves put their faith Christ not in Judaistic observances, as Jesus states in John 5:45-46, 8:56. Thus, He is the only way for Jew and Gentile alike (Acts 4:12). And, He only has one Church on earth that has faithfully maintained the traditions of the Apostles, both in Word and in Epistle (2 Thess. 2:15). Unfortunately, Hagee, like those who for a time believed in Christ in the first century and fell away as the writer of Hebrews mentions, Hagee has also has apostatized into Judaism because he is blind to the Spirit of Christ operative in the Old Testament. In other words, in this bad hermeneutic, one fails to understand typology. This is why St. Paul writes: 7 But if the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones, was glorious [the Old Covenant], so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, which glory was passing away, 8 how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious? 9 For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, the ministry of righteousness exceeds much more in glory. 10 For even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the glory that excels. 11 For if what is passing away was glorious, what remains is much more glorious. 12 Therefore, since we have such hope, we use great boldness of speech 13 unlike Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the end of what was passing away. 14 But their minds were blinded. For until this day the same veil remains uplifted in the reading of the Old Testament, because the veil is taken away in Christ. 15 But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart. 16 Nevertheless when one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. 17 Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. 18 But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord. What could be clearer? The Old Covenant has been brought to fulfillment and fruition by the New. It (the Law alone) cannot save (and never could), and those who still adhere to it as the proper way to approach God are unfortunately blind to the types of Christ which are found throughout the Law (Luke 24:44). Christ is the true High Priest; Christ is the true Moses; Christ is the true inheritor of the Abrahamic promises; Christ is the fulfillment of the promise to David concerning a kingdom, and on and on. And, all of this is actualized at Christ s First Advent not at some fictitious, literal millennial kingdom in Jerusalem or Illinois. Thus, the kingdom is now (Col. 1:13), and it is the Church, and is ruled by His faithful Bishops abnd priests (Matt. 16:18 with 18:18).7. Consider the First Century writer, St. Clement of Rome, who was ordained by St. Peter wrote: Through countryside and city [the apostles] preached, and they appointed their earliest converts, testing them by the Spirit, to be the bishops and deacons of future believers. Nor was this a novelty, for bishops and deacons had been written about a long time earlier. . . . Our apostles knew through our Lord Jesus Christ that there would be strife for the office of bishop. For this reason, therefore, having received perfect foreknowledge, they appointed those who have already been mentioned and afterwards added the further provision that, if they should die, other approved men should succeed to their ministry  (Letter to the Corinthians 42:4 5, 44:1 3 [A.D. 80]). That s  apostolic succession. Or consider what St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, wrote in his Letter to the Smyrneans (ca 100 A.D.): CHAPTER VIII. LET NOTHING BE DONE WITHOUT THE BISHOP.See that ye all follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the presbytery as ye would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being the institution of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. It is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a love-feast; but whatsoever he shall approve of, that is also pleasing to God, so that everything that is done may be secure and valid. St. Cyril of Jerusalem, in his Catechtical Lectures, Lectures 4 and 18, warns: Fall not away either into the sect of the Samaritans, or into Judaism: for Jesus Christ henceforth has ransomed you. Stand aloof from all observance of Sabbaths, and from calling any indifferent meats common or unclean. But especially abhor all the assemblies of wicked heretics; and in every way make your own soul safe, by fastings, prayers, almsgivings, and reading the oracles of God; that having lived the rest of your life in the flesh in soberness and godly doctrine, you may enjoy the one salvation which flows from Baptism; and thus enrolled in the armies of heaven by God and the Father, may also be deemed worthy of the heavenly crowns, in Christ Jesus our Lord, to Whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen. 25. Of old the Psalmist sang, Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, (ye that are) from the fountains of Israel. But after the Jews for the plots which they made against the Saviour were cast away from His grace, the Saviour built out of the Gentiles a second Holy Church, the Church of us Christians, concerning which he said to Peter, And upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it Matthew 16:18 . And David prophesying of both these, said plainly of the first which was rejected, I have hated the Congregation of evil doers; but of the second which is built up he says in the same Psalm, Lord, I have loved the beauty of Your house; and immediately afterwards, In the Congregations will I bless you, O Lord. For now that the one Church in Judea is cast off, the Churches of Christ are increased over all the world; and of them it is said in the Psalms, Sing unto the Lord a new song, His praise in the Congregation of Saints. Agreeably to which the prophet also said to the Jews, I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord Almighty Malachi 1:10; and immediately afterwards, For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, My name is glorified among the Gentiles. Concerning this Holy Catholic Church Paul writes to Timothy, That you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the House of God, which is the Church of the Living God, the pillar and ground of the truth 1 Timothy 3:15 . St. Athanasius, in his First Festal Letter, Sec. 8, writes: 8. Now observe; that city, since the coming of our Savior, has had an end, and all the land of the Jews has been laid waste; so that from the testimony of these things (and we need no further proof, being assured by our own eyes of the fact) there must, of necessity, be an end of the shadow. And not from me should these things be learned, but the sacred voice of the prophet foretold, crying;  Behold upon the mountains the feet of Him that brings good tidings, and publishes peace Nahum 1:15;  and what is the message he published, but that which he goes on to say to them,  Keep your feasts, O Judah; pay to the Lord your vows. For they shall no more go to that which is old; it is finished; it is taken away: He is gone up who breathed upon the face, and delivered you from affliction.  Now who is he that went up? a man may say to the Jews, in order that even the boast of the shadow may be done away; neither is it an idle thing to listen to the expression,  It is finished; he is gone up who breathed.  For nothing was finished before he went up who breathed. But as soon as he went up, it was finished. Who was he then, O Jews, as I said before? If Moses, the assertion would be false; for the people were not yet come to the land in which alone they were commanded to perform these rites. But if Samuel, or any other of the prophets, even in that case there would be a perversion of the truth; for hitherto these things were done in Judea, and the city was standing. For it was necessary that while that stood, these things should be performed. So that it was none of these, my beloved, who went up. But if you would hear the true matter, and be kept from Jewish fables, behold our Savior who went up, and  breathed upon the face, and said to His disciples, Receive the Holy Ghost John 20:22.  For as soon as these things were done, everything was finished, for the altar was broken, and the veil of the temple was rent; and although the city was not yet laid waste, the abomination was ready to sit in the midst of the temple, and the city and those ancient ordinances to receive their final consummation. Similarly, the 8th Canon of the Seventh Ecumenical Council (787 A.D.) states: Since certain, erring in the superstitions of the Hebrews, have thought to mock at Christ our God, and feigning to be converted to the religion of Christ do deny him, and in private and secretly keep the Sabbath and observe other Jewish customs, we decree that such persons be not received to communion, nor to prayers, nor into the Church; but let them be openly Hebrews according to their religion, and let them not bring their children to baptism, nor purchase or possess a slave. But if any of them, out of a sincere heart and in faith, is converted and makes profession with his whole heart, setting at naught their customs and observances, and so that others may be convinced and converted, such an one is to be received and baptized, and his children likewise; and let them be taught to take care to hold aloof from the ordinances of the Hebrews. But if they will not do this, let them in no wise be received. In conclusion, bad theology leads to worse theology, and often this is based in a faulty hermeneutic with false presuppositions. With Hagee, its a serious failure to recognize Christ in the Old Testament and typology. Both he and the Zionists are united in rejecting the teaching of the historic Orthodox Fathers. Heresy is like a virus that compounds itself. Premillennialism, dispensationalism, and its offshoot, the virtual worship of Israel, are serious errors that, when worked out to their illogical conclusions, end up denying Christ s divinity and/or necessity of faith in Him for salvation. Hagee demonstrates that.READ MORE SHADOW GOVERNMENT NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Shadow Government FilesTo hear Jay s full podcasts, see more information and learn how you can become a subscriber to JaysAnalysis.Jay Dyer is the author of the forthcoming title, Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film from Trine Day.

        "text": "To say people aren t happy is an understatement. People are extremely angry about state Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon shelving the single-payer healthcare bill in California.Huffington Post reports that Rendon has received death threats since making this decision.It is a shame that the bill got shelved as we all wanted to see how California would fare, but nobody should be threatening another life over it. We, as people, are meant to be better than that. Especially those of us with progressive outlooks.Rendon opted to pull the bill last week despite his support for a single-payer system. He called the plan  woefully incomplete.  He urged the state Senate to  fill the holes  and send the Assembly a  workable  bill next year. Even senators who voted for SB 562 noted there are potentially fatal flaws in the bill,  he said in a statement on Friday. These include its failure to address  many serious issues, such as financing, delivery of care, cost controls, or the realities of needed action by the Trump administration and voters  to make the bill  a genuine piece of legislation,  he said.That sounds fair, does it not? If we re going to do something progressive, we need to do it as correctly as possible, not half-baked. Rendon does not sound like he s against the plan.Yet, the death threats poured in. Supporters organized protests at Rendon s district office in Los Angeles County, as well as outside the state capitol in Sacramento. Some single-payer supporters held signs depicting the California state flag s grizzly bear stabbed in the back with a knife that reads  Rendon.  Social media got ugly, as always.I get it. We re all frustrated over the current healthcare situation in America. We all wanted to see how California would do with a single-payer system. It could pave the way for other states and do amazing things for everyone. But I think we should all step back and be rational about things. Rome wasn t built in a day.You have a right to be angry, but people need to stop sending death threats when things don t work out.Featured image via ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images",

        "title": " ICE Agent Spills: We\u2019re Targeting Children For Detention \u2018Because We Can\u2019",
        "text": "Trumpers are rejoicing over the escalating activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of their wholly misguided belief that undocumented immigrants do nothing but sit here, in the U.S., illegally soaking up every dollar that should go to actual Americans. That mentality has spawned five squillion allegations about the behavior of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has gotten increasingly brazen, and even abusive, since Trump s election.One ICE agent has apparently had enough, and he s speaking out. Jonathan Blitzer, a contributing writer to The New Yorker, got in touch with this agent (who would only allow these details to be published under condition of anonymity) who finds himself increasingly alarmed by the culture shift at the agency.He s particularly angry about ICE s specific targeting of children who entered the country as unaccompanied minors years ago. Those children were placed with families and allowed to attend school here, hopefully so they could make themselves into contributing members of society. He told Blitzer something shocking: That they re going after these children literally because they can, even though there s no real policy for what to do with them after they re rounded up. The plan is to take them back into custody, and then figure it out. I don t understand it. We re doing it because we can, and it bothers the hell out of me.The whole idea is targeting kids. I know that technically they meet the legal definition of being adults. Fine. But if they were my kids travelling in a foreign country, I wouldn t be O.K. with this. We re not doing what we tell people we do. If you look [at] next month, or at the end of this month, at the people in custody, it s people who ve been here for years. They re supposed to be in high school. This isn t some rookie who s only been with the agency for a few months or a year, and probably hasn t fully assimilated into the culture and become a cold-hearted, contemptuous, power-drunk officer. This is veteran officer who has been in federal immigration enforcement since the Clinton administration.He talks about what things were like before Trump: ICE used to look at the full circumstances of a deportation case before making decisions. He feels that the job of the agency is not to judge the people they re detaining, and yet, many ICE agents are doing just that now, and that s part of the problem. Their contempt is growing by leaps and bounds and it s affecting how the agency runs as a whole (which Trump fans no doubt love).While this particular agent was heavily critical of Obama and what he saw as micromanaging from Obama s administration, there s so much now that s gone that it s really no wonder individual agents seem hungry to arrest and remove as many people as possible   even if those people are children. It sounds like they re becoming single-minded about it.And this agent is also upset about the use of resources. Our immigration system is already badly clogged, and has been for a long time. ICE is pretty much intentionally making that worse. We still have to make decisions based on a responsible use of the government s resources you can t lock everybody up, We re putting more people into that overburdened system just because we can. There s just this school of thought that, well, we can do what we want. This is Trump s America. This is what the Trumpers want   they want  the other  gone and they don t care how it happens or who that  other  is, let alone what it s going to cost us. The fact that ICE is targeting children who were specifically placed with families here, and who should be attending high school now, is just flat-out vile. This is not America.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",

        "text": "Republicans were just given a leg up over Democrats in this fall s presidential election in the battleground state of North Carolina, and they have a judge put in place by George W. Bush to thank for it.Federal judge Thomas D. Schroeder decided in favor of Republican legislators in court on Monday, letting a controversial voter ID law stay in place despite strong objections from civil rights groups.Research on Voter ID laws have shown that these laws are often a reliable way for Republican conservatives to cut down on voters that often vote for Democrats, especially minorities and young voters.The judge, Thomas D. Schroeder of Federal District Court in Winston-Salem, wrote near the end of his 485-page opinion that  North Carolina has provided legitimate state interests for its voter ID requirement and electoral system. North Carolina s voter identification law requires people to display one of six credentials, such as a driver s license or passport, before casting a ballot. Those who cannot may complete a  reasonable impediment declaration  and cast a provisional ballot.Schroeder was officially put in place on January 8, 2008, at the beginning of George W. Bush s last year in office.The North Carolina law also banned same-day registration, cut down on the amount of days available for early voting, and stops 16 and 17-year-olds from preregistering to vote.An expert testified at the trial that the law was designed in a way to put extra burden on black and Latino voters. Republican legislators and the state s GOP governor Pat McCrory deny the claim.In 2012, a Republican Pennsylvania State House leader bragged that that state s voter ID laws would  allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania  (he didn t), while recently a Republican congressman from Wisconsin said voter ID would make the state   which has recently voted for Democrats   competitive in the fall for Republicans.President Obama won North Carolina in 2008 by 0.32% then lost it in 2012 by 2.04%. Polling in March showed the race in North Carolina effectively a toss-up between the Democratic and Republican presidential front runners.Featured image via Flickr",

        "text": "Right after Ted Cruz suspended his presidential campaign, evangelical Christians went nuts, pouring sadness and fear all over social media about their own fate now that their personal government crusader was not going to make it to the White House. Now, it seems they ve gone into complete, total and utter despair, crying that there s nobody left to represent them and their dominionist ideals.According to the Washington Post, Nebraska Pastor Gary Fuller had a Sunday service planned around Ted Cruz remaining in the race. Instead, he had to tell his congregation to vote according to their convictions because he didn t know what else to say. He also said: In a sense, we feel abandoned by our party. There s nobody left. Honestly, B-O-O H-O-O. Religion needs to be left out of government, and if they have to learn that lesson the hard way, tough bananas.The Post notes that evangelicals tend to vote according to social and moral issues, and Ted Cruz ran his campaign on those issues. Candidates that run on social issues tend not to do well, though, because there are far more pressing issues on which to vote than who s screwing whom, who s marrying whom, and what women are having done in their doctors  offices.These people have a problem with Trump s being married three times to three different women, and the fact that he doesn t have much interest in fighting for their ideals on social issues. He s a hardliner on immigration, and his main focus has been on that, plus jobs and the economy, however crazy and unworkable his ideas actually are. Social issues are non-issues to Trump right now, which, if the GOP unifies behind him, makes them non-issues for the entire party.Russell Moore, of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, whined to the Post: This year the Republican Party has not just surrendered on the culture wars, they ve joined the other side. And that s a unique situation. Many evangelical Christians don t seem to believe in the 1st Amendment   some, like disgraced Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore, even think religious protection only applies to Christianity. Anything else is infringement on their beliefs, even if it doesn t directly affect them.Ted Cruz was their savior, and now he s out.To this, we say our hearts bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for them and their dashed hopes for turning us into a Christian nation this year.Featured image by Richardlwelsh.

        "text": "The average American makes $52,250* per year. The extra $25K Obama stole from working Americans didn t include free college or the redistribution of your income to people who would rather not work. It didn t include support for people who came here illegally and need to be taken care of either.  Over the course of the 86 full months that President Barack Obama has completed serving in the White House from February 2009 through March 2016 the U.S. Treasury has collected approximately $18,764,164,000,000 in tax revenues (in non-inflation-adjusted dollars), according to the Monthly Treasury Statements issued during that period. (President Obama was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2009.)That equals approximately $124,003 for each of the 151,320,000 persons who, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, had either a full- or part-time job during March 2016.During the same 86-month stretch of the Obama presidency, the total debt of the federal government increased from $10,632,005,246,736.97 to $19,264,938,619,643.07, according to the Treasury.That is an increase in the debt of $8,632,933,372,906.10 or approximately $57,051 for each of the 151,320,000 people with jobs as of March.If the Treasury succeeds in collecting the full $3,335,502,000,000 in reveneus that the White House Office of Management and Budget estimates it will collect in fiscal 2016 (which will end on Sept. 30), Obama will become the first American president whose Treasury collected more than $20,000,000,000,000 in taxes (in non-inflation adjusted dollars) during his time in office.As of the end of fiscal 2015 (on Sept. 30, 2015), the Treasury had collected a total of approximately $17,287,946,000,000 during the 80 full months Obama had at that point served as president.By the end of this September if the Treasury collects the estimated $3,335,502,000,000 in revenues for this year the Treasury will have collected $20,623,448,000,000 in taxes during the 92 full months Obama will by then have served in the White House.During the first 86 full months that George W. Bush was president (February 2001 through March 2008), according to the Monthly Treasury Statements, the Treasury collected approximately $15,099,826,000,000 in taxes. (From February 2001 through January 2009, the Treasury collected $17,251,191,000,000 in taxes. Bush was inaugurated on Jan, 20, 2001 and left office on Jan. 20, 2009, when Obama was sworn in.)The $15,099,826,000,000 in taxes that the Treasury collected during Bush s first 86 full months in office equaled approximately $103,363 for each of the 146,086,000 persons who had a full- or part-time job in March 2008.During the first 86 full months of George W. Bush s presidency, the debt increased from $5,716,070,587,057.36 to $9,437,594,138,091.39.That is a debt increase of $3,721,523,551,034.03 or approximately $25,475 for each of the 146,086,000 persons who had a job in March 2008.For entire story: CNS News*US Census ",

The border directives come immediately on the heals of Trump s recent statements and executive move to renegotiate, or cancel Washington s position in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the TransPacific Partnership (TPP).Once again, Trump is wasting no time putting his signature campaign issues into play   something many of his critics have doubted he would be doing.READ MORE MEXICO NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Mexico FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",

        "text": "Rick Scott is an absolutely horrible governor and literally gives zero f*cks about the people of Florida   even babies. Governor Scott is being accused of eliminating health standards for children s heart surgery after a hospital donated $200,000 to Republicans, including his own political action committee.In 2015, CNN revealed that St. Mary s Medical Center in West Palm Beach had an extremely high mortality rate in their pediatric cardiology program. Between 2011 and 2013, the hospital had a 12.5 percent death rate for open heart surgeries on babies and children; by comparison, the national average was 3.3 percent. So many children were dying at the hospital that in 2014 five independent pediatric heart doctors arrived at the hospital to review the program. The doctors were horrified by what they found, and recommended that the hospital stop performing surgery on babies under six months old and not perform any complicated procedures on older children.The hospital ignored their advice and more children and babies died. The state of Florida was warned by multiple highly respected cardiologists that the hospital had problems, but the state did nothing. Actually, that s not true, they did something far worse than nothing.Two moths after CNN s investigation was published, the state eliminated standards that have been in place for nearly forty years to protect pediatric heart patients. Why? Because during the same period of time that all of the children were dying in St. Mary s, the owners of the hospital, Tenet Healthcare, donated $200,000 to Rick Scott s PAC and the Republican Party of Florida.David Nykanen, co-director of the Heart Center at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, called the move to eliminate the standards AFTER the donations  too much  of a coincidence: The coincidence is just a little too much. It s just a little hard to swallow. Tenet s Shelly Weiss Friedberg told CNN that they had nothing to do with the state s decision: At no time have we discussed the pediatric cardiac standards with the governor or his office, or with any elected official or anyone on their staff. Our opinion was not sought on the standards nor have we expressed a position on the possible repeal of the standards or the role of the Cardiac Technical Advisory Panel. Nyakanen was not convinced, saying, If someone is contributing at that level, obviously they have to have some influence. If Tenet Healthcare contributed so much money, you d think they have the ear of the governor and the politicians. Last month Administrative Law Judge John Van Laningham agreed that the state should do away with the standards, claiming that suggesting the quality of healthcare would diminish is a little insulting to the health care professionals who personally deliver those services.  But at St. Mary s the quality was never there to begin with and if anything the state should have stepped in and prevented the hospital from ever operating on tiny humans again. Of course, this is Rick Scott s Florida that we are talking about and he cares little about the people of the state he was elected to serve.This is not the first time Rick Scott has screwed over the people of Florida when it comes to healthcare. The former hospital CEO/Medicare thief and House Republicans brought the government to a grinding halt when they refused to expand Medicaid to nearly a million of the state s working poor. Now that they have done this, it is absolutely crystal clear that Florida s GOP-led government will stop at nothing to help their donors   even if that means killing your children.Featured image via Facebook",

        "text": "A couple of artists purchased the bus that Donald Trump used while campaigning in Iowa. The artists have turned the bus into a spectacle of political satire. They have made many changes to the bus, including changing Trump s campaign slogan from,  Make America Great Again  to  Make Fruit Punch Great Again. One of the funniest things about the bus wasn t even added by the artists. The bus was initially rented from a party bus rental company, so it features a stripper pole. The artists left it in, as they saw it as a perfect metaphor for Trump and his campaign. The bus used to be used as a party bus and the Trump campaign leased it from them, but they never removed the stripper pole. So we re kind of using that as kind of a metaphor for Trump. Like all good satire, the bus is only changed slightly. The artists added elements that fictionalize reality, in order to better examine it. The small changes lead people to come look at the bus, with them not initially realizing what the bus actually is. People come over and they re all excited and they don t even read that it says Make Fruit Punch Great Again,  said Mary Mihelic, an artist who is part of the anti-Trump bus project according to the  The Guardian.  And they re just totally taking pictures and then you ll hear someone say,  Honey, it s a gag! It s a gag!  And we just crack up. The artists explain their intentions behind the installation in a video that is embedded below. They claim that their work is meant to be non-partisan.

        "text": "Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz seemingly planned to pay cyber-probe suspect and IT aide Imran Awan even while he was living in Pakistan, if the FBI hadn t stopped him from leaving the U.S. Monday. Public statements and congressional payroll records suggest she also appears to have known that his wife, a fellow IT staffer, left the country for good months ago   while she was also a criminal suspect.In all, six months of actions reveal a decision to continue paying a man who seemingly could not have been providing services to her, and who a mountain of evidence suggests was a liability. The man long had access to all of Wasserman Schultz s computer files, work emails and personal emails, and he was recently accused by a relative in court documents of wiretapping and extortion.Imran Awan is seen here with Bill Clinton in February of 2017:Imran Awan and Bill Clinton Feb '17 pic.twitter.com/ZdWJvt9H2q  archiebird (@archiebird) May 27, 2017Records also raise questions about whether the Florida Democrat permitted Awan to continue to access computers after House-wide authorities banned him from the network Feb. 2. Not only did she keep him on staff after the ban, but she also did not have any other IT person to perform necessary work that presumably would have arisen during a months-long period, according to payroll records.Wasserman Schultz employed Pakistani-born Awan and his wife Hina Alvi, and refused to fire either of them even after U.S. Capitol Police said in February 2017 that they were targets of the criminal investigation. She said police wouldn t show her evidence against the couple and, without it, she assumed they might be victims of anti-Muslim profiling.Heavy   Awan, 37, was at Dulles International Airport trying to leave the country when he was arraigned and surrendered his passport, Chad Pergram of Fox News reported. Awan was charged with bank fraud, according to Fox. The U.S. Capitol Police, FBI, and Customs and Border Protection were all involved in the arrest. According to the complain, he had bought a ticket to fly to Doha, Qatar and then Lahore, Pakistan, and had a return flight booked for January.Awan pleaded not guilty to one count of bank fraud on Tuesday, and he was ordered to turn over his passports. A hearing is scheduled for August 21 at 1:45 p.m.Awan, his wife Hina Alvi, along with several other related IT staffers had been under investigation since February, Politico reported. Officials accused them of stealing equipment from House members  offices, along with committing other possible violations. Details about the investigation were vague at first. Politico described the investigation in this way:  The employees allegedly stole equipment from members  offices without their knowledge and committed serious, potentially illegal, violations of House IT policies. In March, Fox News went into a little more detail, saying that at least five contractors, including Awan and his brothers Jamal and Abid Awan, were being investigated for possibly removing equipment from offices, including computers and servers. Fox News reported in March that the allegations included running a procurement scheme that involved buying equipment, then double-billing the House administrative office, and possibly having unauthorized access to the House computer system. Items that may have been double-billed included computers, iPads, monitors, keyboards, and routers.According to Politico, Awan earned nearly $2 million since 2004 as an IT support staffer for House Democrats. Alvi began working for House Democrats in 2007 and earned more than $1.3 million since then. Their salaries were split among multiple lawmakers  offices. None of the staffers under investigation had access to classified information, Politico reported.Awan booked a round-trip ticket to Pakistan in July and planned to depart Monday, July 24 with a return ticket in six months. He was arrested at Dulles Airport during his attempt to leave.The Associated Press reported that Awan s lawyer, Chris Gowen, said Awan  had informed the House of his plans to visit his family. Wasserman Schultz s spokesman cited Awan s Monday arrest as the reason for ending his employment on Tuesday:  Upon learning of his arrest, he was terminated. The office s insistence that his termination was prompted by the Monday arrest   and not the House Sergeant at Arms banning him and his wife from touching congressional computers or his six months in Pakistan   suggests that had he boarded the flight without incident he would still be on payroll.Awan s wife, Hina, left the country under similar circumstances March 5, after withdrawing the couple s three kids from school without telling Virginia education officials, packing up all of her possessions, and hiding $12,000 in cash, according to an FBI affidavit. She allegedly had hundreds of thousands of dollars waiting in Pakistan for her   money the FBI says Awan had obtained partly through mortgage fraud and had wired overseas using a false explanation.Two days later, on March 7, House records show Hina was cut from Wasserman Schultz s payroll.Though Hina bought a round trip ticket with a return in six months, the FBI said it  does not believe that Alvi has any intention to return to the United States. Wasserman Schultz spokesman David Darmrom did not respond to a DCNF IG request to explain why Hina had been terminated two days into a trip she claimed was temporary, while her husband had not been terminated for a six-month move. Between the part-time nature of her work and the ban, her absence was unlikely to have been noticed in two days without someone telling the office her plans.Wasserman Schultz s office also didn t answer if the office knew Hina s  round trip  was a permanent move.Hina and Awan were both IT aides whose jobs required access to the network, but the House Sergeant-At-Arms banned them from accessing it beginning Feb. 2. Awan and Hina were her only IT staffers, and payroll records through the latest available period, March 31, indicate that no other IT staffer or vendor was added to the payroll after their ban.A House source said Awan was seen in the House office building multiple times after the network ban.  Imran Awan is working in an  advisory  role for Wasserman Schultz, her spokesman said,  providing advice on technology issues. The spokesman wouldn t say who did the office s computer work after the ban, if not Awan.As IT administrators, the suspects could read all emails sent and received by the lawmaker and see all files on the staff members  computers, numerous House IT aides said. Wikileaks shows that Awan also had the password to Wasserman Schultz s iPad.In public court documents filed in Fairfax, Va., Awan s stepmother accused him of wiretapping and extortion.  Imran Awan did admit to me that my phone is tapped and there are devices installed in my house  and  Imran Awan threatened that he is very powerful and if I ever call the police again, [he] will   kidnap my family members back in Pakistan,  his stepmother, Samina Gilani, claimed in the documents (p. 21) filed April 14.Despite her professed concern of stereotyping, all other colleagues who employed Awan, Hina or their other relatives on House payrolls fired them, including Rep. Andre Carson of Indiana, who is Muslim and has criticized Wasserman Schultz for blocking police from examining a laptop tied to Imran.That laptop was found in an unused crevice of a House office building and seized as evidence by the Capitol Police, but Wasserman Schultz appeared determined to not let police see its contents, threatening  consequences  for the police chief if he didn t release it. The exchange was captured on video.  Daily Caller",

        "text": "MSNBC  the cable  news  station who hired tax cheat, FBI snitch and paid race baiter, Al Sharpton as a mouthpiece to spew hate for the sniveling leftists who run the pathetic low ratings network After being called out by The Gateway Pundit, MSNBC took down a video mocking a police officer being dragged from a car by a suspect fleeing the officer.MSNBC deleted their report but not before The Gateway Pundit saved a screengrab of it The video, which was posted Friday night, was removed Saturday afternoon from MSNBC s Facebook and Twitter accounts within an hour of publication of The Gateway Pundit report.The video was titled,  Does it count as a police chase if you take the cop along for the ride? MSNBC subsequently posted an apology to Twitter, but the statement did not state what precisely was being apologized for, nor was there an apology to the law enforcement community.A video tweeted from @msnbc Friday evening has been removed. The material was inappropriate. It should not have been posted and we're sorry.  MSNBC (@MSNBC) May 16, 2015 A video tweeted from @msnbc Friday evening has been removed. The material was inappropriate. It should not have been posted and we re sorry. The takedown of the videos and apology by MSNBC came within one hour and twenty minutes of the 2:57 p.m. CDT posting of the article at TGP.The MSNBC video was posted in conjunction with NowThisNews and was also deleted from the Twitter account of NowThisNews Saturday after The Gateway Pundit report.Commenters at the Facebook page slammed MSNBC:Erick Delumeau:  MSNBC you have shown your true colors again. Irresponsible reporting. A family member just had this happen to his partner and his partner suffered a head injury. So everyone who allowed this to air with circus music, deserves to be fired. Walter Daniel Bosak:  You re network is disgusting. This officer could have been killed all because this individual thinks it s ok to resist a lawful investigation partly because networks like yours have advocated violence against police. Tiffany Eve:  You should be ashamed of yourselves MSNBC!!! These men and women in uniform serve and protect us all, and this is how you treat them? An apology to all law enforcement officers and their families should be in order. Kyle Bodenhorn:  Way to go MSNBC. You once again proved why cops around the world have a great disdain for media. This officer is lucky to be alive and you made jokes about his being dragged. Surely you feel that adding fuel to the fire of the hatred for police is a better news story than the thousands of police who have spent the week in D.C. honoring slain police as it is Police memorial week. Estela Ramirez:  Msnbc how is this comical with this head line and music like this is a joke. The cop could have or was probably injured because of this. If it was a black man being dragged by a cop this head line would be different. This is tasteless and just shows how the media works to its own benefits. Via: Gateway PUndit",

        "text": "The Republican National Convention was already shaping up to be a nightmare, and for Donald Trump and the very few GOPers that are going to be in attendance, it s about to get a lot worse.Pro-LGBT group Planting Peace found the perfect way to troll bigoted Republicans, and they unveiled it earlier today. Directly outside where the RNC in Cleveland will be held next week is a new billboard showing Trump and Ted Cruz, who was once smeared by the business mogul but is now speaking at his convention, seconds away from the grossest make-out fest you ll ever imagine. The caption on the billboard is also perfect: Love Trumps Hate. End Homophobia. Planting PeaceThe timing is perfect   Planting Peace erected the billboard right as the Republican platform committee approved what is being referred to as the GOP s most homophobic party platform yet. To encourage Republicans attending the RNC to actually consider how the party s bigotry might be affecting America s youth, Planting Peace said: We challenge the GOP to think about how many times their children could hear messages like these and not be impacted or question their value and worth? These messages sink our young people into a spiral of depression and directly correlate to queer youth attempting or actually committing suicide. The blood of these children is on the hands of the anti-LGBT platform of the republican party. Planting Peace is the same non-profit that brought The Equality House, a rainbow-colored house sitting across the street from Westboro Baptist Church, into existence   so it was only appropriate that this equally troll-like statement like this would come from them. Aaron Jackson, the President of Planting Peace, said the sign was meant to attack the GOP s anti-gay agenda: What Donald, Ted and the Republican Party either fail to realize, or realize and just don t seem to care about, is that their words and actions toward our LGBT family especially LGBT children have meaning and impact. LGBT children hear these messages telling them they are nothing but second-class citizens and are left feeling broken or  less than. When children are dying because of negative messages, then it s time to change the message. Planting Peace calls for the immediate change in the Republican party platform with regard to our LGBT family and LGBT rights. Never again shall a negative, hateful message be uttered in the name of  religious freedom.  We are calling for action that brings full, fundamental rights to the LGBT community, and a narrative that empowers LGBT people to live and love freely. This billboard is going to have Trump and his brainless supporters going insane. We can only hope that someone will be able to take a picture of Trump s face when he sees it.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",

        "text": "Well, this came back to bite Allen West on the ass.The former Republican congressman from Florida apparently wants to be part of Donald Trump s cabinet. So he had to scrub and make up a pathetic excuse to explain a very racist post on his Facebook page.In celebration of Trump s choice of former General James Mattis to be Secretary of Defense, West posted a meme of Mattis with the caption,  Fired by Obama to please the Muslims. Hired by Trump to exterminate them. Here s the now-deleted post via Twitter.Once in a while, the mask slips down   and people like Allen West reveal their true thoughts. pic.twitter.com/zaREZ34VdF  Imraan Siddiqi (@imraansiddiqi) December 11, 2016That s right. West literally cheered for Mattis because he expects him to commit genocide against 1.6 billion people who practice Islam.It s despicable and West should be automatically taken out of consideration for any spot on Trump s team.But in an effort to cover his ass, West has the editor-in-chief of his website take responsibility for the post and apologized for it. You know, because West is too cowardly to do it himself. As editor in chief, I must take full responsibility for this, although I was not the one who posted it, and it was posted without my knowledge,  Michele Hickford claimed.  I neither condone nor support the message included in the meme. This meme was not created by me or any of our writers. It was reposted from another source. The image has been removed. Its message was despicable, offensive to many, and a terrible error in judgment by the person who posted it. Furthermore, it does not reflect Col. West s beliefs, principles and values. Clearly, West is still incapable of taking responsibility for things himself, just like Donald Trump. And it s not like there isn t any proof that West hates Muslims and has no problem committing war crimes against them.Four of the men under his command in Iraq beat an Iraqi policeman in an effort to get information. West then threatened to kill the man by firing his pistol near the man s head. This is torture and to make it stop, the man gave meaningless information to his tormentors. West should have faced a court-martial but he was allowed to retire instead will full benefits.So Allen West has no business being put in charge of a government department nor should he be placed in any position of authority in our government at all. His hatred of Muslims disqualifies him and it would be an insult to humanity to appoint him.Featured Image: Wikimedia",

Some of his former staffers, like his onetime press secretary Matt Higgins, have endorsed Clinton.It seems like Rudy is really off his rocker when everyone around him, including his own family, are voting for the other candidate.One has to wonder what Trump promised or paid Giuliani for his ardent (and downright insane) support.Featured image via Matt Millis McKnight/Getty Images",

        "text": "When The Newsroom was canceled almost at the height of its popularity, a hole was left in the world that none have yet filled. Will McAVoy, the lead character on the show, was fictional   but that didn t stop him from becoming one of the most popular  news  figures in the country. Clips from the show have repeatedly gone viral, with one video from the first episode of the show going viral repeatedly because of Jeff Daniels  character s blunt and honest statements about whether or not America is the  greatest country in the world. People are drawn to McAvoy because he represents something that is missing from American media: someone who is willing to tell the truth no matter what anyone else thinks about it. The world has missed Will McAVoy, but Daniels resurrected the character so that his beloved character could give his take on the 2016 election. While Trump is sure to respond by calling Daniels a  loser,  he tells it like it is. Bloomberg Television hosts Mark Halperin and John Heilemann ask  McAvoy  what makes Trump the  best-case scenario  for Hillary Clinton, but the fictional newscaster (drawing on the energy from the widely-shared  greatest country  segment) dropped a truth bomb   he s not: He s not the best-case scenario, John, that s my answer. Donald Trump is a fact-bending loose cannon who alienates mainstream voters with everything he says. But he gets constant media attention for free. There won t be a day from now until November when Trump isn t on every TV channel. Sure, she beats Trump in some categories: like millennials, who don t even show up to vote. She also leads in number of messages deleted on her personal email server,  McAvoy continues.  But that aside, when you ask what makes Trump the best-case scenario for Hillary, I don t know what the f*ck you re talking about. His tiny hands?

On his church website, he bragged about his military experience in the Army and claimed that he graduated from North Greenville University with a Bachelor of Science.The only problem is that neither of those claims are even remotely true, which means Burns has been lying to his congregation and the American people.During an interview with CNN host Victor Blackwell, Burns was taken by surprise when called out for posting false information about himself.When asked if he attended the university, Burns said that he had, but then Blackwell confronted Burns about the claim on his website that he actually graduated. As it turns out, Burns only attended for one semester.Burns whined and claimed that the interview was supposed to be  off the record,  but Blackwell made it clear that he  didn t agree to that. Burns continuing complaining and accused Blackwell of character assassination. This is not fair at all,  Burns whined.  I thought we were doing a profile and all of a sudden you re here to try to destroy my character. I m not here to destroy your character,  Blackwell said before getting back to the results of CNN s investigation.Blackwell proceeded to grill Burns and revealed that not only did Burns not graduate from North Greenville University, he didn t serve six years in the Army either. He only briefly served in the National Guard.Here s the video via YouTube.Burns later released a statement claiming that he only lied in his biography because he wanted to be taken seriously as a pastor. As a young man starting my church in Greenville, South Carolina, I overstated several details of my biography because I was worried I wouldn t be taken seriously as a new pastor. This was wrong. I wasn t truthful then and I have to take full responsibility for my actions. Burns, who has raked in the money as a televangelist, has built his empire on a foundation of lies that automatically disqualifies him from serving as a so-called  man of God. This man lied to become a pastor and he has been lying to his congregation ever since.But Burns could not even take full responsibility for his sins as he blamed the media and claimed that he is only being outed because he is a black man who supports Donald Trump. I do also want to set the record straight about why this attack is happening   because I am a black man supporting Donald Trump for president. For too long, African-American votes have been taken for granted by Democratic politicians, and enough is enough. So Burns literally played the race card, which something conservatives hypocritically often claim that liberals do.So not only is Burns a liar, he s a hypocrite and one has to wonder what else he is hiding.Featured Image: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images",

After the GOP abruptly pulled their healthcare bill from consideration Friday, spirits among the worst among us were pretty dim. We just pulled it,  Donald Trump told the Washington Post after the decision to nix the embarrassing disaster of a bill, noting that he doesn t  blame  Ryan for this huge loss. Moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains. We re feeling those growing pains today,  Ryan told reporters, noting that  this is a disappointing day  for those whose biggest dream is stripping healthcare from millions and that  doing big things is hard. All of us, all of us   myself included   will need to time to reflect on how we got to this moment,  he added.How we got to this moment is that the Affordable Care Act is immensely popular. While it could use some improvements   like a move toward universal healthcare   the GOP s effort to  repeal and replace  is not as popular with voters as it may have seemed on the campaign trail.But they won t actually reflect on that, will blame Obama, and will present Americans with something equally horrible somewhere down the line.Ryan was forced to utter one of the most beautiful 22 words we have heard since Donald Trump was kinda-sorta elected by less than half of the population: ObamaCare will remain the law of the land until it s replaced. We re going to be living with ObamaCare for the foreseeable future. The president gave his all in this effort. He did everything he possibly could to help people see the opportunity we have with this bill. He really has been fantastic,  Ryan said. Still, we have to do better and we will. This battle is won. The Affordable Care Act is safe for now. But the war is far from over, and all of us must fight each day to oppose the GOP s hateful agenda.The only thing standing between them and the destruction of all we hold dear is us.Watch Ryan s shamed admission below:\"Obamacare is the law of the land and it will remain the law of the land until it's replaced,\" Speaker Ryan says: https://t.co/Okz2bwUl4f pic.twitter.com/9F3MnW7oMR  CBS News (@CBSNews) March 24, 2017Featured image via screengrab",

        "text": "Note to conservatives who want to pretend to be journalists: be sure that where you get your information is not a satirical site, or you ll be humiliated like this idiot.This is especially true if you decide to attack a professional scientist, because if you haven t done your research properly you can rest assured they will discover that fact when they research your claims.In this case, that s exactly what popular scientist Neil deGrasse Tyson did to right-wing radio host Neal Larson this week after the conservative mouthpiece repeated the charge that Tyson  mocked  a little girl for wanting to live on Jupiter, a planet where no human could survive.The alleged  mocking  supposedly took place in front of a crowd and on Twitter, Larson crowed in the vicious hit job on Tyson and his character in an op-ed criticizing Tyson for simply inserting math into the Olympic medal count. The scientist pointed out that while America earned more medals than Hungary, Hungary is actually beating us when we adjust to account for total population. Then the victory for medals to population ratio goes to Hungary.Larson believes this is Tyson attacking America when in reality he was only stating a mathematical fact that also happenes to be interesting.Larson went on to whine about Tyson because he constantly calls out conservatives for getting science wrong. He also attempted to assassinate Tyson s character by using the following tale as an example. I ve listened to Neil deGrasse Tyson before. And what I observe is a smart guy who consistently enjoys asserting his intellectual supremacy over others more than he actually likes educating. In one of his worse moments, Tyson mocked a 12-year-old girl who suggested she d like to live on Jupiter. He ridiculed her in the midst of a crowd, then later, several times, on Twitter. That told me everything I needed to know about Neil deGrasse Tyson.For that moment he was just a horse s astrophysicist. The only problem is that the story never actually happened, and Tyson schooled Larson for it. The  incident  with a 9yr old girl never happened,  Tyson responded.And he s right. As it turns out, the story relayed by Larson is complete satire. It looks to be a hoax,  Tyson continued.  No such tweets ever existed on November 29th, 2015, or on any other day. So you abrogated your journalistic integrity by not verifying what you read in somebody else s article, before using it as a foundational pillar in yours. In short, Larson just got lit up by Tyson and those pesky things called facts that conservatives are allergic to for some reason.Featured image via screen capture",

Although India is not one of the seven countries that were part of the initial travel ban, Hussain and Khan had alleged they were victims of it when their first attempt at procuring visas to travel to the United States was turned down in late January, the first business day after Trump s travel ban was put in place.Khan told the BBC that an employee at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi told them they were being rejected because of  current policy. U.S. officials said at the time that the denial was not connected to the travel ban. An embassy spokesman said they were preparing a statement for release later in the day.  National PostThe reckless and irresponsible acts of Democrat legislators like Senator Chuck Schumer, perfectly illustrates why Trump was right about demanding that we put additional vetting measures in place for immigrants. Hussain and team manager Abid Khan arrived Feb. 23 in the bucolic Adirondacks town, which had been following their visa ordeal and extended them a hero s welcome. Locals offered congratulations and free lodgings at an inn that in the snow looked like a  fairy tale scene from a movie,  Khan said in a Facebook post.The  fairy tale  was shattered Wednesday, when Hussain, 24, was arrested and charged with felony sexual abuse and child welfare endangerment, police said.The parents of the 12-year-old girl allegedly involved said the incident happened Monday, after the end of the three-day snowshoe competition, and reported it to local authorities.Chief Charles A. Potthast Jr. of the Saranac Lake Village police force said the girl was playing pool Monday afternoon with other young people at the inn where Hussain was staying. There was a moment when the two were alone, and that s when the incident occurred,  Potthast said. The girl told police there was a  passionate kiss  and that Hussain touched her in an intimate area on top of her clothing.Hussain remains jailed on $10,000 bond. Khan said the athlete told him he had done nothing wrong.A spokesman for Schumer said the senator helped with the visa process at the request of Saranac Lake and described the charges against Hussain as  extremely troubling. A spokesman for Gillibrand said the senator thinks the charges are  extremely serious. During their time in Saranac Lake, Hussein and his coach were honored with a special reception by the mayor and gave a talk about Kashmir at Saranac Lake Middle School, where students had waged a letter-writing campaign on their behalf.  Pack your bags. Next year you are coming to Kashmir,  Hussain told them, according to one of Khan s Facebook posts. Washington PostThe athlete s coach said he is innocent. Mir had said that the visa would not have been issued without the  personal efforts  of Schumer and New York s other Democratic senator, Kirsten Gillibrand. On Saturday, Schumer celebrated Hussain s  rock star  welcome in a Facebook post, saying that the United States is  still a country that welcome athletes from across the globe to compete in our stadiums, our snow-covered fields and everywhere in between.

        "title": "MEDIA IGNORES Time That Bill Clinton FIRED His FBI Director On Day Before Vince Foster Was Found Dead",
        "text": "In its 109-year history, only one F.B.I. director had been fired   until Tuesday, when President Trump fired James B. Comey. In July 1993, President Bill Clinton fired William S. Sessions, who had been nominated to the post by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Mr. Clinton said his attorney general, Janet Reno, reviewed Mr. Sessions s leadership and concluded  in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau. Mr. Sessions had been cited for ethical lapses, including taking free trips on F.B.I. aircraft and using government money to build a $10,000 fence at his home. Mr. Sessions was asked to resign, and was fired when he refused to do so.  Despite the president s severe tone, he seemed to regret having to force Mr. Sessions from his post,  The New York Times wrote about his dismissal:WASHINGTON, July 19  President Clinton today dismissed William S. Sessions, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who had stubbornly rejected an Administration ultimatum to resign six months after a harsh internal ethics report on his conduct.Mr. Clinton said he would announce his nominee to replace Mr. Sessions on Tuesday. He was expected to pick Judge Louis J. Freeh of Federal District Court in Manhattan; officials said Judge Freeh had impressed Mr. Clinton favorably on Friday at their first meeting.Mr. Clinton, explaining his reasons for removing Mr. Sessions, effective immediately, said,  We cannot have a leadership vacuum at an agency as important to the United States as the F.B.I. It is time that this difficult chapter in the agency s history is brought to a close.  Defiant to the EndBut in a parting news conference at F.B.I. headquarters after Mr. Clinton s announcement, a defiant Mr. Sessions   his right arm in a sling as a result of a weekend fall   railed at what he called the unfairness of his removal, which comes nearly six years into his 10-year term. Because of the scurrilous attacks on me and my wife of 42 years, it has been decided by others that I can no longer be as forceful as I need to be in leading the F.B.I. and carrying out my responsibilities to the bureau and the nation,  he said.  It is because I believe in the principle of an independent F.B.I. that I have refused to voluntarily resign. Mr. Clinton said that after reviewing Mr. Sessions s performance, Attorney General Janet Reno had advised him that Mr. Sessions should go.  After a thorough review by the Attorney General of Mr. Sessions s leadership of the F.B.I., she has reported to me in no uncertain terms that he can no longer effectively lead the bureau. Similarly, Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey on the recommendation of his attorney general, Jeff Sessions. (No relation to William S. Sessions.) There are no United States statutes that discuss the president s authority to remove the F.B.I. director.   NYT s Vince Foster: What the Media Won t Tell You Major media outlets reported Wednesday on the Supreme Court hearing of California lawyer Allan Favish s case that government photographs of Vincent Foster s death scene be released for public viewing. The media report that no fewer than five investigations have found that Foster committed suicide because he was depressed. But despite 10 years of denial by the major media, the Foster case has not  closed    as the Supreme Court hearing Wednesday demonstrated. The case won t close because of the failure of authorities to make full disclosure   and to conduct a full investigation into the case, including a complete autopsy.Vince Foster was not only deputy White House counsel but also the personal attorney to Bill and Hillary Clinton.On the night of Foster s death, top Clinton aides made a frantic effort to enter and remove documents from his West Wing office. In the days that followed, federal investigators were stymied in their investigation of Foster s office and strange death.Since Foster s July 1993 death, the facts of his death have been obfuscated by friends of Bill and Hillary in the major media, but here s the undeniable truth:There weren t  five  investigations into Foster s death, as the media report. The Park Police, best known for their meter and horse patrols around Washington, were put in charge of the initial death inquiry of the most important federal official to die suspiciously since President Kennedy. The Park Police, contradicting standard procedure, declared the death a suicide before launching their inquiry.Later, Robert Fiske, selected by Clinton s counsel Bernie Nussbaum and Janet Reno, quickly confirmed the Park Police probe as a suicide.But when Ken Starr entered the investigation, he reopened the case. His chief prosecutor in the case, Miquel Rodriguez, later quit the Starr investigation, claiming that Starr s staff was engaging in a cover-up of Foster s death.Rodriguez, a Harvard-educated federal prosecutor, argued that one of the Polaroid photos taken of Foster at the crime scene indicated an additional wound on Foster s neck   never noted on the autopsy report. Favish s suit before the Supreme Court is seeking to release this photo, among others.No fewer than three of the paramedics on the scene indicated in reports or testimony that the crime scene was consistent with a murder scene, not a suicide.A careful FBI microscopic investigation of Foster s shoes found not a trace of soil or grass stains on them, though he supposedly walked several hundred yards through wooded Fort Marcy Park to where his body was found. [Years later, Starr s investigation found plenty of soil and grass stains. Rodriguez charged that the shoes were tampered with to produce such  evidence. ]According to the FBI report on Vince Foster s death (below) blonde hairs were found on the body of Vince Foster, but were never investigated:Foster was found with little blood around his body   and despite claims that he fired the gun into his mouth, practically no blood was found on the front of his shirt.Foster was found with a 1913 revolver no one in his family could claim, with two serial numbers, made from the parts of three or more guns. None of Foster s fingerprints were found on the gun.For years, detail after detail emerged questioning the official ruling.Significant questions were raised about the unusual gun   a .38 Colt revolver made from the parts of three guns with two serial numbers   found conveniently in Vince s hand.The Park Police said one of the serial numbers indicated the gun was vintage 1913   and had no pedigree.Foster family members insisted neither Foster nor his father ever owned the old revolver.The NCIC keeps records of all law enforcment inquiries of serial numbers.On March 23, 2001, the FBI responded to requests made by a man names Craig Brinkley:Serial number 356555, one of the numbers on the gun, was never searched, not by the FBI, the Park Police or by that  investigation  by Ken Starr.Serial number 355055 was found on the frame of the gun. Brinkley believes that was the gun s real nnumber.That number was indeed searched by the Park Police, on the evening of Foster s death, more exactly at 22:45 EDT on July 20, 1993.Interestingly, searches were conducted on the same serial number no fewer than three times earlier that year, before Foster s death, on March 3, March 7 and April 29.Was someone checking to see that this gun had a  clean  predigree and was untraceable?The bullet from the gun that supposedly killed Foster was never found, despite intensive searches.Despite claims to the contrary, no one who knew Foster, including Hillary, Web Hubbell and his own wife, saw signs of depression.A so-called suicide note was found in an office briefcase that had been searched and found to be empty after Foster s death. The note was torn into 27 pieces. Yet an FBI examination found no trace of Foster s fingerprints on the note and a top Oxford handwriting expert found the note to be an  obvious  forgery.Despite the enormity of the case, Foster s autopsy lasted an astounding 45 minutes. The coroner in the case had previously been overruled in other cases he declared  suicides  that were later found to be murders.All of the X-rays taken during the autopsy are missing.Complete crime scene photos don t exist. The Park Police said all the photos were  accidentally  overexposed. A series of close-up Polaroids, which Favish is suing for, remain. This is just a brief summary of the dozens of inconsistencies in the case. Two New York homicide investigators who looked into the case concluded that Foster s body had been moved to the crime scene and that murder could not be ruled out.Despite overwhelming evidence of a cover-up, the media won t question the official ruling.Ken Starr, who could find no criminal wrongdoing on the part of the Clintons during his  intensive  probe, confirmed a ruling of suicide. Starr even hired O.J. Simpson s defense expert to prove his case.On August 23, 2016, The Daily Mail revealed that FBI agents  reported interviews documenting that Hillary Clinton s stinging humiliation of her friend and mentor Vince Foster in front of White House aides triggered the suicide of Vince Foster were missing from where they should be filed at the National Archives.On the first visit, archivist David Paynter provided the box of records that he said contained the FBI reports of interviews conducted by FBI agents on Foster s death. On a second visit, archivist James Mathis provided what he said were those same documents.While the box contained dozens of FBI reports concerning Foster s death   including interviews with the medical examiner, U.S. Park Police officers, and White House aides about the contents of Foster s office    the reports on Hillary Clinton s role in his death were absent.After filing a Freedom of Information request with the National Archives, Martha Murphy, the archives  public liaison, reported that she directed a senior archivist to conduct a more thorough review of the relevant FBI files, including those that had not been previously made public in response to FOIA requests. He examined all eight boxes but found no interviews by any investigator that detail either a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster or the effects of a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster on Vince Foster s state of mind,  Murphy reported in an email.After firing Republican FBI Director William S. Session, President Bill Clinton temporarily replaced him with Floyd I. Clarke and then on September 1, 1993 he Louis Freeh became the FBI Director. Right from the start, the Freeh FBI was drenched in controversy. The  screw-ups  were legion from the exposure of fraudulent FBI crime lab results to the wrongful blaming of an innocent man for the bombings at the Atlanta Olympics to the bloody standoff and shootout at Ruby Ridge.

        "text": "On Monday, Donald Trump fulfilled his duty as a presidential candidate by praising law enforcement for catching Ahmad Khan Rahami, who was responsible for the Saturday bombing in New York City.TwitterThis would have normally been a nice gesture, if it hadn t been a contradiction of something Trump had said just a few minutes before. Fortunately, whenever Trump flip-flops or lies, Americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh*t via social media   and they didn t hesitate to remind Trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for Rahami s capture, he d dissed the NYPD for allowing  political correctness  to interfere with catching terrorists. Among the first to point this out was MSNBC s Christopher Hayes, who tweeted: Twitter Hayes was referring to a disrespectful comment Trump had made on Fox and Friends shortly before he congratulated the police officers, in which he said: You know, our police are amazing, our local police. They know who a lot of these people are, they are afraid to do anything about it, because they don t want to be accused of profiling, and they don t want to be accused of all sorts of things. Yup   Trump had accused the NYPD of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are, yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame. Other people recognized this epic fail as well, and blasted the Republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and two-faced:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterThis tweet was particularly funny, and I m sure there will be some backlash for Trump to deal with:TwitterThroughout his presidential campaign, Trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than African American police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is a  law and order  candidate. But thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcement having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists, Trump has probably just ruined a year of pro-law enforcement campaigning.Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images",

        "text": "John Oliver, of HBO s Last Week Tonight, dove into the deeply shady world of debt buying and collection on his Sunday segment. But Last Week Tonight isn t just about giving out information. The show often does surprising things well in advance of an air date so they can make the biggest impact possible, and Sunday s episode was no exception. What they did will impact 9,000 people in the U.S.So what happened? Oliver started a debt buying/collection agency in Mississippi called Central Asset Recovery Professionals, Inc., or CARP, for short. He used it to show just how easy and cheap it is to get into this business: Debt buying is a grimy business and badly needs more oversight, because as it stands any idiot can get into it. And I can prove that to you because I am an idiot and we started a debt-buying company. And it was disturbingly easy. Not long after CARP incorporated, they were offered a portfolio of medical debt worth nearly $15 million, and given the names, addresses and Social Security numbers of the 9,000 people who owed that debt: We bought it, which is absolutely terrifying because it means if I wanted to, I could legally have CARP take possession of that list and have employees start calling people, turning their lives upside down over medical debt. The portfolio cost CARP $60,0000   they got it for pennies on the dollar. That s the norm for this business.CARP didn t start sending employees after these people like a regular agency, though. Instead, Oliver and Last Week Tonight got together with a charity called RIP Medical Debt, and forgave all $15 million of it. Those 9,000 people don t have to worry about what they owe to hospitals, clinics, and individual practitioners anymore. They might not even have to worry about whether they ll have to file for bankruptcy anymore.John Oliver just wiped out the medical debt of nine thousand people. Let that sink in while you watch the entire segment, which details out just how disgusting and grisly the debt-buying business is, below:We re the only industrialized nation in the world that doesn t have some form of nationalized healthcare available to everyone, and medical debt is the number one reason people file for bankruptcy here. In fact, more than 60 percent of bankruptcies in the U.S. have to do with medical debt. It can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for one necessary procedure. Cutting-edge cancer treatments can run into the millions.In English, our system is f*cked all to hell because of profit.This move technically cost less than the famous Oprah Winfrey show where she gave her entire audience a new car, spending roughly $8 million. But the impact, and the message, are far greater. Hats off to John Oliver for this.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",

        "text": "A Congressman decided to come clean about what really goes on in DC and it s not pretty. For one thing, he never read anything he voted on A new book threatens to blow the lid off of Congress as a federal legislator s tell-all book lays out the worst parts of serving in the House of Representatives   saying that his main job is to raise money for re-election and that leaves little time for reading the bills he votes on.Mill City Press, a small Minnesota-based  vanity press  publisher describes  The Confessions of Congressman X  as  a devastating inside look at the dark side of Congress as revealed by one of its own.   No wonder Congressman X wants to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. His admissions are deeply disturbing.  The 84-page expos  is due in bookstores in two weeks, and Washington is abuzz with speculation about who may be behind it. The book, a copy of which DailyMail.com has seen, discloses that the congressman is a Democrat   but not much else. The anonymous spleen-venter has had a lot to say about his constituents, however. Robert Atkinson, a former chief of staff and press secretary for two congressional Democrats, took notes on a series of informal talks with him   whoever he is   and is now publishing them with his permission. Voters claim they want substance and detailed position papers, but what they really crave are cutesy cat videos, celebrity gossip, top 10 lists, reality TV shows, tabloid tripe, and the next f***ing Twitter message,  the congressman gripes in the book. I worry about our country s future when critical issues take a backseat to the inane utterings of illiterate athletes and celebrity twits. Much of what s in the book will come as little surprise to Americans who are cynical about the political process.  Fundraising is so time-consuming I seldom read any bills I vote on,  the anonymous legislator admits.  I don t even know how they ll be implemented or what they ll cost.   My staff gives me a last-minute briefing before I go to the floor and tells me whether to vote yea or nay. How bad is that?  And on controversial bills, he says,  I sometimes vote  yes  on a motion and  no  on an amendment so I can claim I m on either side of an issue.

Jeb Bush repeatedly hammered Trump for not being a serious candidate. Enter his top strategist, Paul Manafort, who spoke to Chris Matthews on MSBNC Tuesday night, where he directly reinforced the serious joke that is Donald Trump and his campaign.Manafort and Matthews were discussing just how exciting the GOP convention will be. Manafort insisted that, since Trump is already a TV star, he understands the media, and he can make the convention and everything else very entertaining.

        "text": "If there is one thing that s immediately clear by attending a Republican presidential rally or looking at the demographics of Fox News it s that the modern Republican Party is not so  modern  after all. They are old. And each year, they lose more of their supporters to Father Time, while being replaced by a far more progressive youth.Understanding the basic math of this problem can sends shivers down the spine of a Republican political operative. How can they expect to compete with the Democratic Party with their supporters entering their 70s? Sadly, the most obvious answer   update your archaic policy positions, stupid!   never occurs to them. Instead, they are going to try to  fake it.  They ll pretend to be cool.One shot at this sad new attempt to cling onto relevancy comes in the form of  Millennials Rising,  a conservative Super PAC that aims to show the youth that the Republican Party can be  hip  and  dope  and  on fleek.  Their ads are pathetic as they sound.Here s one supporting Jeb Bush:Seems like it was made by an old guy desperately trying to figure out what is cool, right? That s because it kind of was.In an investigation by The Intercept, reporters found that  Millinnials Rising  is 95 percent funded by old rich guys. The principle backer is a 72-year-old billionaire who  earned  his fortune by being the grandson of an oil baron.Of the $54,960 total raised by the Super PAC, $50,000, or 91 percent, comes from the snowy-haired, 72-year-old billionaire Robert A. Day. He is the grandson of Superior Oil founder William Myron Keck and a former investment manager. Day has also given $1 million to the pro-Bush Super PAC Right to Rise.The rest of the Super PAC s backers are all about equally far into their golden years.Zooming out, the silliness of a bunch of rich old guys funding a Super PAC intended for 18-year-olds is exactly why the Republican Party is such a mess. Rather than come to accept that things like homophobia and regressive social safety net positions are out of sync with where America   especially its young people   are at, they try to throw money at the problem. Unfortunately, all the Instagram filters and Vine loops in the world can t convince young people that Republicans aren t the party of backwards policies.To give us a sense of what is coming, Mitt Romney desperately tried to win the  Millennial  vote in 2012 by throwing a fortune into ads at them   he still lost them 2 to 1.Obama easily won the youth vote nationally, 67 percent to 30 percent, with young voters proving the decisive difference in Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, according to an analysis by the Center for Research and Information on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University.It wasn t even close.Feature image via YouTube",

        "text": "As Trump prepares to kick off his 2020 campaign so he can avoid doing real work in the White House, a new poll has devastating news for him: If the 2020 election were held tomorrow, a generic, unnamed Democrat would beat him. That means that more people would vote for pretty much any Democrat in order to keep Trump from being re-elected.The Politico/Morning Consult poll has 43 percent of respondents saying they would probably pick the Democrat even without a name right now. Only 35 percent said they would vote for Trump.Worse, the number of Trump voters who would vote for him again is slipping. 71 percent of Trump voters said they d vote for him again, compared to 87 percent of Hillary s voters who would vote for the generic Democrat.And perhaps even worse than that is the fact that 26 percent of people who answered this poll believe Trump is the worst president we ve had since WWII. 25 percent hold that same opinion of Obama, but Trump s presidency is all of one month old. Obama served his eight years and has a legacy for people to look at.It s really not often that people believe history will view a president that badly just thirty days into his first term.For Trump, where his image and ego are everything, the idea that people would rather support a generic someone over him has got to be horrifying. This is a poll he would probably call  fake news,  because of the people who line the streets outside Mar a Lago (who are protesters), and all the electoral votes he won, and so on.Add all of this to the fact that he really is planning a campaign event in Florida for this weekend, and has declared himself eligible for candidacy for 2020 already, and what it shows right now is that people believe he can t do the job. Presidents often enjoy a certain  honeymoon  period with both the press and the populace following their election. Trump has been screwing up so badly so quickly that his honeymoon didn t even happen.The only people who still think he s doing a good job are his most ardent supporters. But those people would support him even if he nuked the U.S. back into the Stone Age.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",

        "text": "As the fallout from Gretchen Carlson s sexual harassment lawsuit continues, people are stepping forward and offering their two cents (or less) on the issue. It s only natural that former employees would want to weigh in on this as well, and some who are weighing in are really disgusting about it. Former Fox Business executive Ray Hennessey, for instance, threw his totally worthless cents into the ring when he decided to tweet this absolutely sexist crap:There will be lots of piling on Roger Ailes today, but I find the charges hard to believe, except in the context of his sense of humor. 1/2  Ray Hennessey (@Hennesseyedit) July 6, 2016 I can t see Ailes, who is overall a great manager of people, demanding a sexual relationship from any employee. Lawsuit distorts reality 2/2  Ray Hennessey (@Hennesseyedit) July 6, 2016Except Ailes has a history of this that goes back decades. We suppose all those allegations were distortions too, because Ailes was just joking and why can t women take a joke? Or a compliment? Or or or or This is really disgusting. Carlson not only has to endure the strain of the suit itself, but she gets to deal with having her name publicly dragged through the mud as a man-hating feminazi who wants to destroy Ailes  career and life because he fired her.Or anything else along those lines.Hennesey could stand to do a little Googling on the issue before going off. Several sources from Fox News have come forward confirming Carlson s allegations and saying sexual harassment was a regular thing for him. One woman said he d ask her to  turn around so he can see my ass.  Another said Ailes told her she could only wear dresses on the air. That source also dropped this bomb: He always brags to people about how he doesn t do polling or testing when he chooses his on-air talent. He told me that if he was thinking of hiring a woman, he d ask himself if he would fuck her, and if he would, then he d hire her to be on-camera. Ailes also hated Carlson and called her a  crazy, vindictive bitch,  according to these sources. It s very telling that they requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.In other words, there are a lot of people at Fox News who know he s a disgusting, dirty little old man who can t keep his pants zipped. Hennessey made a fool of himself, along with putting himself into that same, sexist  women are all vindictive bitches looking to ruin men s lives  corner.Featured image by Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images",

This undercover expose on the explosion of  homeless  people on just about every corner in suburban Detroit shines a light on the  business  of panhandling. Should panhandling be protected by the First Amendment?Panhandlers standing on the corners has become an increasing issue. Men, women, old and young, all begging for your money.The problem has moved from the city to the suburbs, but why? And, should you give?It seems to have happened in recent months. Panhandlers, everywhere, including American s first highway, Woodward Avenue.They hold signs and pull at your heart strings. Some claim to be homeless, to have cancer, or be a veteran who is hungry. But, are we being conned?We spotted a young guy at the corner of Woodward Avenue and Maple on a recent Friday afternoon panhandling. Moments later, we watched as he folded up his sign and walked to a nearby parking lot where he got into a dark colored SUV.We spotted the same SUV on different occasions at a house in a nice neighborhood in West Bloomfield. When confronted, the young guy first closed the door without answering if he considered what he was doing fraud.Moments later, after being exposed, he came out, profanities flying   upset he was going to be on TV.To some, panhandling has become a job. Honest Abe  and his crew work the corner at 8 Mile and Woodward daily. He even accepts credit cards, but says he is truly homeless and panhandling frauds are becoming more frequent.The problem is growing. Corners that were once off limits are now prime real estate and a recent court ruling involving the Michigan Chapter of the ACLU allows it to happen. Court said conduct of asking for money in public is a form of free speech, it must be protected by the First Amendment.  Attorney Ryan Berman told 7 Action News.We discovered many panhandlers work in teams, sharing signs and corners. Some use your money to buy food, others trade the cash for drugs, booze or cigarettes.Elizabeth Kelly with Hope Shelter in Pontiac says if you want to really help, there are other ways to give.

Horace Frank with the Los Angeles Police Department stated in a press conference in October 2016: The male caller threatened to kill the person who answered the phone along with other members of the center because of the caller s hatred for Muslims and his belief that Muslims will destroy the United States. The Rebel has obtained new documents and evidence through police disclosure surrounding the case which proves that the first phone call made to the Islamic Center came from the phone of a different California man, Michael Slawson.Michael Slawson is the son of Democratically appointed Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Slawson.In other words, Slawson s father is a judge in the same justice system under which Feigin was charged.",

On Saturday, during the Democrats of Massachusetts state convention, Warren did the best thing that you can do to a bully like Trump   gave him a taste of his own medicine.Warren has blasted Trump multiple times over the past few months, yet nothing she has said compares to the no-holds barred verbal punches she threw out during her speech at the convention.Speaking about the giant predatory scheme that was Trump University, Warren likened the presumptive Republican presidential candidate to a sleazy car salesman: It was like a used car dealership except that s not fair to used car dealerships,  Warren told the audience.  His playbook said to look for people with problems; they make good targets. Trump even encouraged his sales force to go after elderly people who were trying to build a little financial security, Warren continued.  Now, Trump University failed and that s no surprise. Think Trump Airlines, Trump Steaks, Trump Magazines, Trump Vodka, Trump Casinos, Trump Mortgage, Trump Games, Trump Travel, Trump Ice, Trump Network, Trump Radio, and Trump New Media Company. These were ordinary folks who were targeted because they had problems and Trump saw they were vulnerable and he could make a buck. Here s a man who builds a business to profit off other peoples  pain. He wants to be Commander-in-Chief, but he s only qualified to be Fraudster-in-Chief. Warren s evisceration of Trump is both thorough and rooted in factual evidence. The speech is a glorious indictment of Trump s fraudulent schemes and should serve as a reminder of just how terrible a Trump administration would be for the United States. Trump s campaign, much like his business schemes, is nothing more the exploitation of those who are desperate enough to believe that a has been reality TV star has anything to offer in the way of being a true leader.You can watch the speech below.Featured image via  video screenshot",

Penny s precinct, Detroit Precinct #152 had an unbroken seal and everything looked proper. The tag on the box said 306 and the book said 306 and the ticket said 306, so there should be 306 paper ballots on the box, right.

        "text": "Comedy Central s roasts of various celebrities are well known by this point, and it s just as well known is that the roasts almost never focus exclusively on the person being roasted. This year s roast is all about Rob Lowe, and the roasters do go after him quite heartily and gleefully. However, it seems that Ann Coulter is also inexplicably a roaster this year, and the other roasters decided to burn her about as bad as they did Rob Lowe.Coulter is a Trump fangirl. She s also just about the most racist and hateful public figure in all of existence. She takes all of Trump s bizarre rhetoric 700 steps farther than it needs to go, while calling him out for not going far enough. These comedians don t really seem to like her all that much, and neither did the audience. They actually booed her for using her appearance there to promote her most recent book,  In Trump We Trust.  Oh, please.Variety did us all a favor and captured the following zingers delivered at Coulter s expense:Nikki Glaser:  The only person you will ever make happy is the Mexican who digs your grave. Peyton Manning:  I m not the only athlete up here. As you know, earlier this year, Ann Coulter won the Kentucky Derby. Davidson:  If you are here, Ann, who is scaring the crows away from our crops? Lowe:  After seeing your set tonight, we ve seen the first bombing you can t blame on a Muslim. Jeff Ross:  Ann is against gay marriage. What is your thinking on that? If I can t get a husband, they can t either? Jewel:  I do want to say as a feminist that I can t support everything that s been said tonight. But as someone who hates Ann Coulter, I m delighted. Rob Riggle:  If Ann Coulter is here, someone must have said her name three times. Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! And perhaps the harshest, from Jimmy Carr:  Ann is one of the most repugnant, hateful, hatchet-face bitches alive. It s not too late to change, Ann. You could kill yourself. Coulter herself tried to play comedian, too, and threw out this, ahem, gem, which was probably the only  gem  she uttered all night: I want to welcome everybody to the Ann Coulter roast with Rob Lowe. That s about the only thing she s ever gotten even close to right, even if she did solidify the idea that this roast is all about her. Everything she thinks is twisted, bigoted, false, and delusional. As the old clich  goes, even a stopped clock is right twice a day. Coulter, however, is right considerably less frequently than that.These are just a few of the jokes various Rob Lowe roasters shot her way, despite the fact that she was likewise a roaster, but has no connection to Lowe. Lowe explained her appearance by saying that they need all flavors at these roasts in order to make them work, and that s why she was there.Whatever the reason, though, Variety insinuates that her entire performance fell far more flat than anybody else s. Poor, poor Ann. Our hearts bleed for her and how stupid she ll look on Labor Day, which is when this will air.Featured image by Christopher Polk/Getty Images",

        "text": "After the FBI declined to charge Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing in the email  scandal  conservatives have been frothing at the mouth about for years now, Sarah Palin threw an even bigger temper tantrum than Donald Trump did.In a long rant on her Facebook page, Palin literally called upon conservatives to  tear down this tyrannical system  because Hillary Clinton was not charged with committing any of the crimes conservatives imagined she committed. It s a farce that  no one is above the law  and my heart goes out to all who ve been unjustly accused and destroyed over much lesser crimes than Hillary s,  Palin wrote.  We MUST redouble efforts to restore the rule of law that had sustained the most exceptional nation on earth, with everyone doing their part After telling conservatives to brainwash their kids and annoy anyone who will listen about how Hillary somehow orchestrated the FBI s decision, Palin whined about all the  scandals  President Obama and Hillary Clinton have gotten away with and accused Congress of being complicit.Letting Hillary skate today is no surprise when the team she s on has celebrated its administrators pleading the fifth, over and over again, sending messages to America that they re all above the law. From the IRS s Lois Lerner to Hillary herself testifying in front of Congress, they ve all told Congress to kiss off, and Congress kissed off.Today s FBI forgiveness of tyrants  illegal acts illustrate purpose in why I insist Americans rise up and tear down this tyrannical system that is destroying America from within. Truly, you re either with us or you re against us.Palin concluded her rant with a message to Republicans who refuse to blindly support Donald Trump by referring to them as  traitors. Message to all the  Republican  elites throwing in for Hillary, boasting they ll stay home instead of vote because their particular weakened good ol  boy is not the GOP nominee (the R.A.T.s suffering chappedass because their power and purse are threatened by the grassroots movement to destroy their failed politics-as-usual), Hillary thanks you. She knows she can t win without you.And then she included a bunch of anti-Hillary memes that repeatedly refer to Clinton as a criminal or a crook as well as images that bring up other imaginary  scandals  Republicans wasted time and money investigating only to find zero evidence to support their claims.Here s the full post via Facebook.It must be truly exhausting using the few brain cells she has left whining all the time just because she and her conservative trailer park fans didn t get their way.But that s why she s known as America s village idiot.Featured image via Flickr",

        "text": "Since Jeb Bush started to bring his mother Barbara Bush with him on the campaign trail, it s become more common for the parents of the Republican presidential candidates to swoop in and give their struggling little GOPers a boost.Pastor Rafael Cruz, the father of Texas senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz, tried to do the same for his own son during a chat with Greg Corombos of WorldNetDaily over the weekend, to basically talk about how his son is going to  eclipse Trump and emerge as the nominee.  Considering that Rafael is Ted s campaign surrogate and a religious man, this of course meant some fear-mongering and crazy Christianity references similar to the time he claimed that God was raising up Ted to be the next POTUS.This time, the elder Cruz was on a real mission to convince America that God is behind his son s candidacy and will make sure that he wins the election. Rafael said: I think what is going to happen is the body of Christ is going to rise up. Believers are coalescing around Ted Cruz and I think when the people of God realize that we need a man of faith, a man of integrity, a man that you can trust his word   two things you can count on Ted Cruz, number one he will tell you the truth, and number two, he will do exactly what he says he s going to do. That Rafael called his son a  man of truth  is hilarious, as Cruz was just slammed in the media for spreading false information about Marco Rubio. Rafael also boasted about his son s ability to be the most outspoken homophobe running for president. Rafael reference the Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality, proudly stating that his son was the only candidate who said the ruling was  not the law of the land, this is an unconstitutional, unlawful decision and five justices have no right to impose their view upon 320 million Americans. Rafael topped off his insane claims with a warning, reminding Americans that  this election is the most important election of our lifetime,  and that if they didn t vote Ted into the White House,  a lot of our freedoms would disappear .You can listen to the crazy interview below:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/248365072  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Rafael Cruz honestly just makes his son look like an even more terrifying candidate whenever he speaks. And now that Jeb Bush has just dropped out of the presidential race, Ted might want to rethink having his bible-thumping dad involved in his campaign affairs. Clearly, the GOP needs much more help than mom and dad can give.Featured image is a screenshot",

        "text": "The Republican Party has descended into madness. The establishment is turning against their own presumptive nominee, members are choosing to back Hillary Clinton, and now their most popular and well-known advocates are leaving the Party in protest, sparking a fast growing  Never Trump  movement.Today, one of the most prominent and outspoken Republican commentators is saying goodbye to the GOP: George Will.The famous columnist, while speaking at a Federalist Society chapter event, blasted the GOP and nominee Donald Trump in a searing speech: This is not my party   Make sure he [Trump] loses. Grit their teeth for four years and win the White House. Will told the audience at the libertarian event that he would change his affiliation to  Unaffiliated.  He reportedly did not say who he would be backing, and spoke against the notion of a coup at the Republican National Convention, saying it was too late.In April, Will wrote a blistering op-ed opinion in which he called on Republicans to keep him out of the White House should he be the nominee, and instead focus on down-ballot candidates: Were he to be nominated, conservatives would have two tasks. One would be to help him lose 50 states   condign punishment for his comprehensive disdain for conservative essentials, including the manners and grace that should lubricate the nation s civic life. Second, conservatives can try to save from the anti-Trump undertow as many senators, representatives, governors and state legislators as possible. One thing is or sure: when a neocon, Pulitzer Prize winning columnist leaves the party over Donald trump, there s a serious issue brewing within. In Arizona alone,  new polls show that almost 15 percent of registered Republicans are backing Hillary Clinton. Due to a highly competitive race among women and Hispanics, Arizona has gone from  solid red  to  leans red. Trump is causing massive disdain within the GOP, and Will is having none of it. This stalwart is calling it quits. As the convention approaches, one must wonder who will be next to jump ship.Featured image via Flickr",

        "text": "As a Catholic I m offended by this Pope s political meddling in our Presidential election beyond words Pope Francis met U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in the Vatican on Saturday morning and the two discussed the need for morality in the world economy before the pontiff left for a visit to the Greek island of Lesbos.Columbia University Professor Jeffrey Sachs told Reuters that the meeting took place in the Vatican guesthouse where the pope lives and where Sanders had spent the night after addressing a Vatican conference on social justice.The Vatican had said that a meeting between the two was not planned, and Sanders said he did not expect to meet the pope during his trip. He is a beautiful man,  Sanders said in an interview with ABC News after the meeting.  I am not a Catholic, but there is a radiance that comes from him. Sachs said Sanders, who was accompanied by his wife, spoke with the pope for about five minutes. Sachs, his wife, and Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, head of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, were also in the room. I just conveyed to him my admiration for the extraordinary work he is doing raising some of the most important issues facing our planet and the billions of people on the planet and injecting the need for morality in the global economy,  Sanders told ABC.The Democratic hopeful from Vermont has campaigned on a promise to rein in corporate power and level the economic playing field for working and lower-income Americans whom he says have been left behind, a message echoing that of the pope.When Sachs, who has advised the United Nations on climate change, was asked if the meeting could be interpreted as political, he said:  This was absolutely not political. This is a senator who for decades has been speaking about the moral economy. The meeting came just days before Tuesday s Democratic party primary in New York, where polls say he is trailing Hillary Clinton. After he won seven of the last eight state contests, a loss in Sanders  home state would give front-runner Clinton a boost toward the party s presidential nomination.Sanders, the Brooklyn-born son of Polish Jewish immigrants, has said the trip was not a pitch for the Catholic vote but a testament to his admiration for the pontiff.

        "text": "In Ohio, the District of Columbia, and 21 other states this election year, 17-year-old citizens are allowed to vote in their state s caucus or primary as long as they turn 18 by the time of the general election in November.The rule allows thousands of 17-year-olds to participate in the Democratic process of voting for the very first time in their lives, but Ohio s Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted reversed the rule, revoking the rights of the 17-year-olds from voting in the state s primary on March 15th. It will be a key battleground state between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Primary, and among the Republican presidential candidates, as current Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich will try to make his mark on the primaries by winning his home state.His argument was the primaries were electing delegates who will eventually elect a nominee for their party at a the party conventions later this year. Husted is distorting the language surrounding the rule which allowed 17-year-olds to vote early by alleging the 17-year-olds can nominate a candidate, but not elect one for office.The Secretary of State before Jon Husted, Jennifer Brunner, allowed 17-year-olds to participate in the 2008 primary election.  Ohio s pro-voter practice that welcomes young adults into the process has been on the books since 1981,  said State Rep. Kathleen Clyde (D-Kent) in a statement on Husted s recent change in the rules. Secretary Husted s latest underhanded, backroom attack on our most fundamental freedom should have us all concerned   about this and about his repeated claims he has made it easier to vote in Ohio   when in fact he continues to find ways to make it harder. This is not the first time Republican Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted has tried to restrict voter access in Ohio. He was sued last year by students for restricting voter rights, put restrictions on early voting in the state, and continues to impede on voters  rights in the state of Ohio. The right to vote should be facilitated, not restricted, but leave it up to the Republicans to try to make distorted arguments and reasoning for making what should be a no brainer of opening up young people to the Democratic process and encouraging voting, an issue legislators have to waste time arguing over.Featured image via Addicting Info",

        "title": "JUST IN: CLOSE FRIEND of Hillary Clinton Who Planned To \u201cStep Away From Politics\u201d Found DEAD In Apparent Suicide",
        "text": "Houston, Texas trial lawyer and Democrat mega-donor Steve Mostyn died on Thursday in what authorities are saying was a  suicide,  according to the Houston Chronicle. Mr. Mostyn was only 46, he left behind a wife and several children, and earlier this year had announced that he was going to be stepping away from politics to spend more time with his family.Details about how Mr. Mostyn allegedly committed suicide are slim. However, his family said that it happened after he  suddenly  became afflicted with some sort of mental illness then took his own life, although they weren t clear as to what type of mental illness he suffered from.But it is worth noting that Mr. Mostyn had never suffered from mental illness in the past, according to his family, further raising suspicions over the manner in which he died.Mr. Mostyn was a progressive powerhouse who was heavily involved in politics throughout his career. He made his fortunes off of suing insurance companies after hurricanes ravaged his state, and used his wealth to fund numerous Democrat and progressive causes, including the Super PAC  Ready for Hillary,  which he and his wife co-founded with Susie Tompkins Buell, a radical environmentalist and member of George Soros s Democracy Alliance.Mr. Mostyn s wife, Amber, was also a member of the Democracy Alliance and a close friend of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the keynote speaker at a 2010 Annie s List event honoring Amber. The Mostyns were close to the Clintons in general, having held numerous high-dollar fundraisers for Hillary s failed 2016 presidential run at their Houston home.Houston Chronicle  In 2012 alone, Mostyn donated $5.2 million to various pro-Democratic Super PACs ranging from Planned Parenthood to Texans for America s Future to Priorities USA Action, a pro-Barack Obama PAC, according to the Center for Public Integrity.In 2014, he and his wife donated approximately $3 million to Democratic candidates, including state Sen. Wendy Davis, who we running against Republican Greg Abbott. Davis lost. I am heartbroken,  Davis tweeted Thursday.  Texas has lost an extraordinary person. Steve was a committed and effective fighter for justice, a wonderful husband, father and friend. He leaves behind a lasting impact on everyone who s life he touched. Mostyn and his wife, Amber, were co-founders of the Ready for Hillary PAC, a political action committee supporting Clinton s unsuccessful campaign for president. At the same time, state campaign finance records show he also contributed to a police-affiliated PAC that supported Republican primary candidates.Mostyn also help fund the Texas Organizing Project and Battleground Texas, two Democratic comeback strategies for the party that has not won a statewide election in two decades. It s hard to really quantify the hole it leaves for progressives. He s probably the first true financial benefactor for progressives in Houston, and I say that because it s really different than supporting individual candidates the way trial lawyers have collectively in the past. He really supported the underlying causes, which is a different kind of take, and I m not sure that gets filled, certainly not immediately. Despite the Mostyns and the law firm s high-profile political activism   they contributed more than $1.8 million to Texas politicians in 2016   Mostyn told the Texas Tribune in a September interview that he was growing tired of almost single-handedly funding Democratic candidates in a state that was solidly Republican.He said he intended to downscale his political giving to Democrats in Texas elections to encourage others to step forward.  We ve asked other people to do it and they want to do it and I want other people to get credit for doing it,  the Tribune quoted him as saying.  I mean this is a giant, giant state, if we were trying to flip Vermont we d be done. However, their relationship came under stress in 2015, when ethics watchdog group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) filed a formal complaint against Hillary and her campaign for illegal coordination with the Ready for Hillary Super PAC, the Daily Caller reported. FACT has also asked the Senate Select Committee on Ethics to look into an April 21 meeting in which Clinton campaign aides attended a weekly meeting of Senate Democrats. FACT asserts that the meeting violates ruleThis wasn t the first time the Clinton and Mostyns found themselves being questioned over unethical practices. In 2010, Hillary Clinton s State Department pushed through a multi-billion dollar deal for Boeing in Russia, and just two months later the company gave nearly a million dollars to the Clinton Foundation.Just a short time later, Boeing s top lobbyist and former Bill Clinton aide Tim Keating partnered with Mr. Mostyn s Super PAC to do a joint fundraising venture for Hillary s planned presidential campaign.  America s Freedom FightersFrom FOX News   When Hillary Clinton was America s top diplomat, she also appeared at times like a top salesperson for America s biggest airplane maker, Boeing.Traveling abroad on official business as secretary of state, Clinton often visited Boeing facilities and made a pitch for the host country to buy Boeing jets. During one visit to Shanghai in May 2010, she boasted that  more than half the commercial jetliners operating in China are made by Boeing. A sales plug in Russia in 2009, though, may have proved especially fruitful. While touring a Boeing plant, Secretary of State Clinton said,  We re delighted that a new Russian airline, Rossiya, is actively considering acquisition of Boeing aircraft, and this is a shameless pitch. In 2010, Boeing landed the Russian deal, worth $3.7 billion. And two months later, the company donated $900,000 to the Clinton Foundation.This chain of events is raising new questions for Clinton, and Boeing, as the former secretary of state launches her 2016 presidential campaign. The Boeing deal only adds to a growing list of business deals involving Clinton Foundation donors now coming under scrutiny.Boeing shareholder David Almasi recently confronted CEO James McNerney about the ethics of it. That opens the door to charges of honest services fraud, that there was a quid pro quo between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and Boeing,  Almasi said.In prepared answers to questions posed to Boeing by Fox News, a spokesman defended the company s actions. Our contribution to the Clinton Foundation to help the people of Haiti rebuild was a transparent act of compassion and an investment aimed at aiding the long-term interests and hopes of the Haitian people,  the spokesman said. The company also pointed out that it gave the American Red Cross $1.3 million after the devastating 2010 earthquake.Clinton defenders say there is no smoking gun.  There s zero evidence that Hillary Clinton went to bat for Boeing for any reason other than to benefit the U.S. economy and U.S. workers,  said former Clinton/Gore adviser Richard Goldstein.But the financial connections don t end there. Boeing also paid former President Bill Clinton $250,000 for a speech in 2012. It was a speech that was approved by the State Department s Ethics Office   which according to an Associated Press report often approved the ex-president s speaking engagements within days.Here is a list of mysterious deaths tied to the Clinton s:1   James McDougal   Clinton s convicted Whitewater partner died of an apparent heart attack, while in solitary confinement.

        "text": "The good news: Trump slowly read through his prepared remarks in front of a room full of world leaders and didn t throw up on himself or start a war. The bad news: He accidentally slipped in something he deliberately tried not to. Now his aides are saying the president is just really tired.CNN s Jim Acosta noticed that Trump deviated from his prepared remarks to say the phrase  Islamic terror.  His advisors had urged him to stick with  Islamist extremism  because it denotes that the groups committing acts of terror are using the religion of Islam but do not represent it. This is a crucial point and one that Middle Eastern leaders, understandably, take very seriously.Trump's use of term \"Islamic terror\" during speech deviated from prepared remarks which read \"Islamist.\" pic.twitter.com/ISIRVZkmNc  Jim Acosta (@Acosta) May 21, 2017Despite his teams best efforts, Trump botched it, an  oversight  they confessed to reporters.It was likely an \"oversight\" I'm told. https://t.co/KwMmJ7WPEf  Jim Acosta (@Acosta) May 21, 2017Asked for clarification, Trump s staff told Acosta that Trump made the mistake because he s exhausted. He s apparently bone-tired   despite this being only his second full day overseas.In keeping with Trump s staff s tradition of treating him like a 4-year-old, the anonymous aide said of Trump: He s just an exhausted guy. He s tuckered out.News that Trump couldn t handle even two days overseas tickled Hillary Clinton supporters, who had long said that her record-setting amount of travel while working as Secretary of State under Obama made her uniquely qualified to become president.In 2012, her own staff spoke in awe when describing an insane 27,000 mile 19-day journey they were on as part of a diplomatic trip. Clinton, for her part, joked near the end of it that she could have handled more.One well-traveled Clinton staffer described the France-Afghanistan-Japan-Mongolia-Vietnam-Laos-Cambodia-Egypt-Israel itinerary as  especially absurd, even for us. Despite the mind- and body-numbing time zone hopping, Clinton joked that she was ready for more. I appreciate being here, I am only sorry that I have to leave,  she told reporters on her last stop Monday, in Israel. By comparison, Trump demanded his own trip be cut in half and promptly became  exhausted  on the second day. And you don t need to take his staff s word for it. Video taken at Trump s speech shows a slouching, frowning Trump. At times he seems barely awake.I mean seriously The sick irony is that Trump made much of his ugly presidential campaign about falsely smearing Hillary Clinton as  sickly  and  low energy.  Neither smear was accurate. But like many of Trump s attacks, one gets the sense that he was projecting his own insecurities onto his opponents.How would Hillary Clinton have handled her first overseas trip? We ll never know, but given her history, it s safe to say she wouldn t complain of needing a nap at the very start.Featured image via NBC News",

        "text": "Dem Sherrod Brown and GOP Senator Orrin Hatch go at it! They were discussing the tax plan and Hatch let Brown know he doesn t appreciate the class warfare propaganda THE MIDDLE CLASS WINS WITH TRUMP TAX PLAN:The Senate s plan to rewrite the tax code would go much further than a competing House proposal toward making good on Republican promises to focus on the middle class, a new report shows.Moderate-income people would consistently see the largest percentage declines in their tax bills, according to an analysis released late Saturday by the official, nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.In 2019, people in the middle of the income spectrum, earning between $50,000 and $70,000, would see their taxes fall by 7.1 percent. Those earning between $20,000 and $30,000 would see a 10.4 percent decline, the report shows, while millionaires would get a 5.3 percent tax cut.Unlike with the House plan, that trend holds up throughout the period over which JCT analyzed the Senate proposal. In 2027, for example, millionaires would get a 2.8 percent tax cut from the Senate plan, compared with a 6.1 percent decline for people in the middle and a 10.3 percent reduction for those earning between $20,000 and $30,000.How Republicans  tax plans would affect people in different income groups has been a hotly contested issue in Congress, with the GOP contending its plans are aimed at the middle class while Democrats call them a giveaway to the rich.The House proposal would have a muddled impact on people in different income groups, JCT found earlier this month. At first, modest-income people would be its biggest winners, but the outlook changes after the first few years. Some modest-income people would face tax increases under the House plan, JCT found, and by 2027, millionaires would be its biggest winners.The analysis of the Senate plan, which the Finance Committee plans to formally take up on Monday, shows people in every income cohort receiving a tax cut on average, though it did not examine whether some people within those groups would face tax increases.",

Remember when Obama spoke at events and those opposed to his presidency showed up armed and the president gave zero f*cks? Then remember when Donald Trump said, I Could Stand In the Middle Of Fifth Avenue And Shoot Somebody And I Wouldn t Lose Any Voters.  He probably wasn t wrong there. His supporters are unhinged but devoted. As a candidate, Trump garnered strong support from gun owners and the NRA. As a candidate, he promised to keep the Second Amendment intact. As president-elect, he just banned guns from his inauguration.Gizmodo reports:The transition team has drawn up a list of banned items. For instance, you can t bring drones, selfie sticks, or guns. Which all sounds a bit like 1984, if you ask me. I thought Trump was supposed to be the candidate of freedom. More like the candidate of taking our guns away, amirite?At least it looks like vapes aren t included on the verboten list. Which should make Grover Norquist pretty happy. And it makes sense to ban bicycles, since only granola-gulping, latte-sipping pinkos ride bikes. But why does Trump gotta take away all our fun toys like selfie sticks and firearms?The gun grabbing Marxist-Commie s list of banned items are as follows:Aerosols Ammunition Animals other than service/guide animals Backpacks and bags exceeding size restrictions (18  by 13  by 7 ) Bicycles Balloons Coolers Drones and other unmanned aircraft systems Explosives Firearms Glass, thermal, or metal containers Laser pointers Mace / Pepper spray Packages Selfie Sticks Signs exceeding the size restrictions (20  x 3  x 1/4 ) Structures Supports for signs and placards Toy guns Weapons of any kindAt the bottom of the list it reads,  Any other items determined to be potential safety hazards.

Shame on their progressive values that made it possible for this beautiful 84 year old priest, who was filling in at the church to be beheaded by these monsters!  The ISIS knifemen who stormed into a church in Normandy filmed themselves butchering an elderly priest after forcing him to kneel   before they performed a  sermon in Arabic  at the altar, a terrified witness has revealed today.The 84-year-old priest, named as Jacques Hamel, had his throat cut in a Normandy church this morning in an attack that also left a nun critically injured and both jihadis dead.The two killers, who were both known to French authorities, were shot dead by police marksmen as they emerged from the building shouting  Allahu Akbar . The building was later searched for bombs.One of the extremists who stormed into the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray near Rouen during mass was a French 19-year-old named Adel K., who was being monitored by electronic tag after twice attempting to join fanatics in Syria. Unbelievably, his bail terms allowed him to be unsupervised between 8.30am and 12.30pm   the attack happened between 9am and 11am.Adel K is understood to have forced the priest to kneel while his accomplice, who also lived locally and was on a terrorist watchlist, filmed the brutal killing.This afternoon it emerged that the murdered clergyman was deputising while the regular parish priest was on holiday. French authorities say they have arrested a third man over the attack   a 17-year-old man believed known as HB and believed to be a relative of Adel K.It was also revealed that the Catholic church involved was on a terrorist  hit list  found in the apartment of a suspected ISIS extremist last April.Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for a  merciless  response to the killing while  horrified  ex-Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said he feared  everything is being done to trigger a war of religions .France s Socialist president Francois Hollande addresses the Islamic terror attack with the press here: A nun who was in the church during the attack said the priest was forced to the ground before his throat was slit.French authorities admitted that both of the attackers were subject to security  S  files, meaning both were known terror suspects who should have been under surveillance.Adel K. was a convicted terrorist who was meant to be living with his parents in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray with an electronic tag on his ankle.In March 2015, while still a minor, he tried to reach the terror group s base in Syria via Germany, but was arrested in Munich.  He was placed under judicial control with his parents, but after his 18th birthday again tried to return to the Middle East.Accompanied by two childhood friends, Adel K. headed to Switzerland overland and then took a plane to Turkey, hoping to cross the border into Syria.Turkish police deported him back to Switzerland and, after being sent back to his hometown, he was tried and found guilty of  associating with a terrorist enterprise  on May 22 2015.After spending less than a year of his two-and-a-half-year sentence in prison, he was released on March 22 this year.For entire story: Daily Mail ",

That includes the Dallas Stars, the hockey team from the very-red state of Texas. They decided they were going to poke fun at Trump over his claim that there had to be at least 1.5 million people at his inauguration (there weren t), and they did so using their Jumbotron:Stars Jumbotron with a topical joke. pic.twitter.com/9vsmTG1Agj  Kate Morrison (@unlikelyfanatic) January 22, 2017Yes, that says their attendance was 1.5 million. This is their way of drawing attention to the fact that, as Mashable put it: Donald Trump is really, really obsessed with numbers, especially those that reflect his popularity, sending members of his staff into the world armed with  lies  and  alternative facts  to claim the attendance at his inauguration was HYUGE. Kate Morrison, the person who tweeted the pic of the Stars  Jumbotron, apparently received several thousand retweets within a half hour. As of the time of this posting, she had well over 18,000 retweets, and more than 37,000 likes.The Stars do tend to be irreverent when it comes to egotistical celebrities and their own opponents. They ve trolled Justin Bieber and Toronto; and they went after the city of Winnipeg, too, where they posted a list of  reasons  to visit Winnipeg that included,  Any suggestions?  and  Go visit Vancouver instead. So this isn t anything new, but it is hilarious given Trump s inauguration and his ego. He s so embarrassed by the size of his inaugural crowd that his press secretary, Sean Spicer, told a a series of outright lies in an attempt to convince us that all evidence to the contrary, no matter how obvious, was fabricated.The Stars actually had a crowd closer to 18,500   there s no sports arena in the U.S. that can hold anything close to 1.5 million people. But that doesn t matter   if Trump will lie about his numbers, then there are people who will counter with something as embarrassing as possible for him.Featured image via screen captures from embedded tweet",

        "text": "Donald Trump s obsession with Twitter and inability to concentrate on any concept more complex than a sentence or two is now being put to use by his desperate staff.Trump is about to embark on a high-stakes, crucial sitdown with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Europe. Unfortunately for America, he cannot concentrate on learning anything before he goes. Trump is infamous for refusing to read intelligence briefings (or read anything, really), but his lack of focus has only gotten worse as his poll numbers slide and his petty fights with morning show hosts and his golf trips consume most of his days.His frantic staff is down to one last move to get him to read a few facts before sitting down with Putin. What follows is one of, perhaps, the most pathetic things you ll ever read.Here s what sources told the LA Times about how Trump s team is getting the president to read up on the adversary who interfered in the 2016 presidential election just months ago:The profile, according to two U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the preparations, is part of a thick binder prepared for Trump. The president often doesn t read the usual briefing books and relies on in-person briefings, the officials said, so aides also have written a list of tweet-length sentences that summarize the main points Trump could bring up with Putin.Having thoroughly killed the reputation of the White House in a variety of ways, Trump now isn t even expected to read anything longer than a tweet. And his Republican allies in Congress don t seem to find anything wrong with that.There is a growing sense, both in Washington and around the country, that the executive branch no longer functionally exists. Trump watches an estimated 5 hours of television a day. He tweets at his enemies, sometimes using memes created by racists and which made their way to his desk in mysterious, disturbing ways. He visits his properties and golfs. The rare time staff can get him to actually work on something gets derailed by Trump s incessant ego and casual obliviousness. His staff is now encouraged to bring up Trump and his election win as often as possible. They are told to not contradict him when he says something factually untrue. Sometimes he ll leave Fox News running in the background while his staff tries to conduct business.Even that was too much work, apparently. Now he needs 140 characters or less or his mind will wander to right-wing memes and personal attacks on his enemies. And he appears to be getting worse.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",

        "title": " Trump Executive Order Mandates Two Regulation Cuts For Every New One Created",
        "text": "Donald Trump is literally ordering the government to take two steps back for every step forward.Regulations protect the American people. There are regulations that give us clean water and clean air, regulations that keep workers safe at work with fair wages, regulations that prevent dangerous or poisonous products from being sold to consumers, regulations that keep our food safe, regulations that protect us from predatory banking, and regulations that protect endangered species. And those are just the tip of the iceberg. Without regulations, companies could pollute whenever and wherever they want. Our country would be a disaster. There s a reason why we have regulations.But Donald Trump promised during his first week to kill 75 percent of regulations.  The regulations are going to be cut massively,  he said during a meeting with corporate CEOs on his third full day in office last week.And now he is following through by signing an executive order that requires federal agencies to kill two existing regulations for every new one created and guts funding for new regulations for the entire year.According to Reuters,Trump plans to sign an executive order on Monday that will require that for every new federal regulation proposed, two must be revoked, an administration official said.The order says federal agencies will propose rules they want to eliminate and the White House will review those decisions. The order sets a budget of $0 for new regulations in 2017 and the administration will set a regulation budget each year.Basically, Trump s cabinet could propose a useless regulation and then use it as an excuse to cut two crucial regulations like a food safety rule or rules that regulate pollution.While there surely are regulations that could be loosened to help small business owners, waging total war against regulations and mandating that two be repealed for every new one created is completely asinine and does nothing but hurt the American people and take the country backwards.Again, most regulations on the books were created for a reason and need to remain to protect the environment, our health, and our lives.This is not a game, but Donald Trump sure seems to think it is.Featured image via Shawn Thew-Pool/Getty Images",

Her point was the issue of whether guns belong in American schools is  best left to locales and states to decide.

        "title": " Watch Donald Trump Fail So Hard At Trying To Pander To Right-Wing Christians (VIDEO)",
        "text": "During an interview on CNN s State of the Union on Sunday, Donald Trump was questioned by host, Jake Tapper, on his religious beliefs and support among the socially conservative, right-wing Christians.Things have been getting heated between Republican primary frontrunner Donald Trump, and the runner-up Ted Cruz, to say the least. Cruz has been surging in the polls as Trump maintains his lead. While Trump s lead appears to be unshakable, his support is also static. So the two have been at each other s throats trying to win over voters. In order to win over those voters, they have to convince people that they are the true spokesman for god and the Christian religion.In that arena, Cruz has a major advantage over Trump.  During the Family Leadership Summit, last July, Trump made the mistake of saying something somewhat reasonable to a crowd of hardcore social conservatives. He was asked if he had asked God for forgiveness. Trump responded, saying: I m not sure I have. I just go on and try to do a better job from there. I don t think so. I think if I do something wrong, I think, I just try and make it right. I don t bring God into that picture. I don t. He tried to explain away the gaffe, but it was too late. For those not in the know, asking god, and or Jesus, for forgiveness for their sins is the first and most important thing you can do as a Christian. For many, Trump might as well have said that he is not actually a Christian.This was brought up early in the interview. Trump was asked the question again, to which he replied that he has  a good relationship with God.  Tapper then goes on to question Trump about his behavior that has been seen in tabloids for the past two decades. Trump says that, he has been living a  good life  now for the past few years, so that shouldn t matter.Let s compare that to Cruz, who has a  strap-on  set of God s armor. Whether is trying to take away the rights of LGBT people, or claiming that atheists should not be able to hold public office, Cruz embodies all the terrible qualities that are revered by right-wing Christians.Based on the sentiments expressed in the interview, I don t think Trump has any idea how these people work. Trump can stir up and exploit hatred towards minorities without it coming back to hurt him, but pandering and exploiting the Christian right takes both skill and experience. Two things Trump has neither of.If the Republican primary race was a 90 s boy band, Trump would be the bad boy of the group. Many conservatives might be attracted to him, but Cruz is the one they are going to invite over for Sunday dinner. They might even let him say grace.You can watch the interview, below.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",

        "text": "Joe Biden is as genuine as they come. For many, their first exposure to him was when they watched him decimate Sarah Palin in the pre-election debates with a brilliant mind, clever wit and award-winning smile. Four years later, it was Paul Ryan who looked like a deer caught in the headlights as VP Biden considered his preposterous answers in their debates together and couldn t help but bust out in that ever-popular Joe Biden laugh.Joe Biden is one of the good ones. He s one of us. He s not a wealthy man or a sleezy politician who manages to live large off of campaign war chests; he s just a man   who happens to be second in line for the most powerful office in the world.Last year we were thrust into the personal life of Joe Biden and his family when his beloved son Beau, who the vice president calls his  soul,  was taken from him after a battle with cancer. What many people don t know is the incredible support Mr. Biden received from the only man he can call  boss,  President Barack Obama. The president delivered a beautiful and unforgettable eulogy for Beau, but according to an interview Biden did Monday with CNN, that was just the tip of the iceberg of the love and friendship he showed the Vice President.According to Biden, after Beau had the stroke that began the path towards his passing, President Obama came RUNNING down the hallway of the hospital to see if his friend and colleague was OK. Biden assured the president that he would be; that he and his wife would sell their house to get by and take care of Beau if need be.In an incredible act of selflessness and kindness, our President offered to give Joe Biden and his family whatever financial support they needed to weather the storm. As he tells the story you can see the tears welling up in his eyes. He says repeatedly that he s certain the president will be upset that he made such a personal notion public, but this man obviously wants the country to know exactly what kind of man sits in the Oval Office.He goes on to talk about the president and his family and how they are HIS family. How the President s daughters have sleepovers with his granddaughters and how much the special friendship between them has meant.Warning: The interview is a tear-jerker. Never have I been more proud of our president MY president or more thankful for having had the opportunity to witness his historic and monumentally successful administration than I am after watching this video:Featured image via screen capture",

        "text": "Because #BlackCopKillersLivesMatter right?Supporters of Tremain Wilbourn, the Memphis ex-con accused of shooting Officer Sean Bolton when he interrupted a drug deal on Saturday night, have started an IndieGoGo campaign to funnel money to him and his family.Wilbourn turned himself in after a two-day manhunt.  I want you to know that one, I m not a cold-blooded killer and two, I am not a coward,  he reportedly told Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong. The campaign repeats his claims and says that cops are waging  terrorism  on black communities, and so they have to support ex-cons who kill.The description of the campaign reads in full:This year, police have killed 558 people. 68% of those people were black. Most of them were unarmed. Police brutality and terrorism on the black community remains largely unchecked and less than 1% of those police officers who murder black people without cause are charged with murder or manslaughter.Tremaine Wilbourn turned himself in to police on Monday, August 3rd for fatally shooting a police officer during a traffic stop and he wanted to make clear two things: one- he is not a cold-blooded killer, and two- he is not a coward. While the murderers of Freddie Gray, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, 12 year old Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and countless others are free to enjoy their families and lives, these men are no longer among the living.These barbaric, unjustified murders of black men, women, and children are supported under the rule of law. We have to step up and support our people like the murderers of these men, women, and children have been supported. Please donate anything you can to support Tremaine s children and his family during this difficult time for them.So far, the campaign has raised $116 with 12 funders out of its stated $61,000 goal. We have to support our people,  the campaign s founder,  PK EI  wrote as a comment.  If Darren Wilson can raise enough to put his children through college twice, we should be able to put together this change for Tremaine s family. We Should Always Support Our Own People, Especially When The Situation Is Grime And Questionable, Or When We Are Completely Within Our Rights. Because We Are All We have To Support Us,  reads another from user  thinkanotherway. The campaign declares that Wilbourn did in fact, shoot Bolton to death. If nothing else, its adherence to IndieGoGo s community guidelines is questionable:  Indiegogo is not a place for hatred, abuse, discrimination, disrespect, profanity, meanness, harassment, or spam,  the community guidelines read.  Do no [u]se the Services to promote violence, degradation, subjugation, discrimination or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, or gender identity. IndieGoGo did kill an April campaign helping a cop accused of murder: South Carolina police officer Michael Slager, charged for shooting fleeing suspect Walter Scott to death.

        "title": "Democrats Caught in Major Lie About DREAMERS [Video]",
        "text": "Democrats have been spouting the narrative that DACA recipients are overwhelmingly serving in the military. That s a lie! Fewer than 900 DACA recipients out of 800,000 are serving in the armed forces. The Democrats have been lying about who makes up DACA but this is a HUGE glaring lie.Breitbart News reports that fraud is rampant for DACA:Fraud is rampant and  huge  for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, a former official with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency alleges. Under DACA, nearly 800,000 illegal aliens were given temporary protected status and work permits to remain in the United States. Experts have told Breitbart Texas that during the Obama Administration, background screening was lax.In an interview with LifeZette, former USCIS manager of the agency s investigative unit, Matt O Brien, alleged that the fraud rate for DACA is roughly  40 to 50 percent  and potentially even  higher : Based on what I had seen and what I discussed with my colleagues, the fraud rate is 40 to 50 percent. It s possible that it was higher,  he told LifeZette this week.IN CASE YOU WANT MORE INFO ON DACA: WATCH AG Jeff Sessions Explain Why Obama s Unconstitutional Act Has Harmed Americans US Attorney General Jeff Sessions brilliantly lays out the case for America and against those who believe it s okay to break our laws, as long as you have lawmakers who are willing to look the other way The Department of Homeland Security will stop processing any new applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. I am here today to announce that the program known as DACA that was effectuated under the Obama administration is being rescinded,  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Tuesday at a Justice Department news conference.Sessions was critical of the Obama program implemented through executive order in 2012 to give work authorization and government benefits, like Social Security to nearly a million illegal aliens.  MRCTV Watch: The brilliant Jessica Vaughan, from the Center for Immigration Studies, shared these important facts about DACA recipients in America, compiled by Harvard University researcher Roberto G. Gonzales, called the National UnDACAmented Research Project. There are important (self-acknowledged) caveats to the findings: The research is based on an online survey of just over 2,000 self-described DACA-eligible respondents and about 200 follow-up interviews. Gonzales believes that for a variety of reasons, the respondents are more educated and well-off than the DACA population as a whole.Nevertheless, the findings are interesting. Here is a sample:73 percent of DACA recipients he surveyed live in a low-income household (defined as qualifying for free lunch in high school); 22 percent have earned a degree from a four-year college or university; 21 percent have dropped out of high school; 20 percent have no education beyond high school and no plans to attend college; 59 percent obtained a new job with a DACA work permit, but only 45 percent increased their overall earnings; 36 percent have a parent who holds a bachelor s degree; and 51 percent were already employed before DACA. None of this is to suggest that these individuals should not be considered for an amnesty or legalization program, but to suggest that the arguments in favor of such a program are largely political rather than economic. Immigrants who are not highly educated and who are working in low-paying jobs are more likely to access welfare and other public assistance programs over the course of their lives. ",

        "text": "The anti-establishment tide is rolling across Europe. You really can t blame the citizens for being furious at their leaders for allowing the invasion of Muslim immigrants into their hometowns and major cities. If this sentiment catches fire in America this summer, it will not likely bode well for Crooked Hillary at the polls in November, given that Trump is the ultimate non-establishment politician History professor Gudni Johannesson won Iceland s presidential election after riding a wave of anti-establishment sentiment, final results showed Sunday, although the vote was eclipsed by the country s eagerly-anticipated Euro football match.The political newcomer, who won with 39.1 percent of votes, was trailed by businesswoman Halla Tomasdottir, also without party affiliation, who took 29.4 percent, according to results announced on public television channel RUV.Johannesson only decided to run for the presidency after the so-called Panama Papers leak in April which detailed offshore accounts and implicated several senior Icelandic politicians, including the prime minister who was forced to resign.Throughout the campaign, Johannesson emphasised his non-partisan vision of the presidency, and vowed to restore faith in the political system after years of public anger toward politicians over scandals and financial woes.The victory was especially sweet for the history professor and political commentator, who has never held public office and has no party affiliation, as he celebrated his 48th birthday Sunday.David Oddsson, a former conservative prime minister who had been Johannesson s closest rival throughout most of the campaign, garnered just 13 percent of votes. The representative of the old era  has been rejected, people are looking to the future,  University of Akureyri political science professor Gretar Eythorsson told AFP.The president in Iceland holds a largely ceremonial position. More important legislative elections are due in the autumn.But the outrage that fuelled mass street protests in April and led to ousting of premier Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson appeared to have dissipated somewhat as euphoria erupted over the Icelandic football squad achieving a historic feat in the Euro 2016 football tournament.A North Atlantic island of just 334,000 people, Iceland beat Austria 2-1 on Wednesday to qualify for the last 16 in its first major international competition, and will face off against England on Monday.Britain s vote to leave the European Union also headlined the news on the eve of the election in Iceland, which itself had applied for EU membership in 2009 after suffering a devastating financial crisis in 2008, but abandoned the bid six years later.Like most of Iceland s voters, Johannesson is opposed to EU membership.

Everyone s favorite draft-dodging, pants-pooping pedophile with a penchant for posting horrifically racist sh*t, NRA board member Ted Nugent, recently outdid himself to such a degree that he performed an action rarely seen on his hate speech-filled Facebook wall   he hit  delete. In a March 31 Facebook post   now scrubbed from the annals of internet history   Nugent said: Before all the braindead dishonest lying scum politically correct racist hatepunks get all goofball toxic on us here, I am simply promoting a brilliant entrepreneur in Detroit that created a clever bussiness. His words, not mine. Ya gotta luv this guy!! When in doubt whip it out! Whom does Nugent love? What sort of thing could get the  hatepunks  (read: reasonable people) riled up?It was probably the fact that Nugent posted a photo of a fake moving company van that frequents white supremacist message boards:While it s obvious why Ted Nugent loves it   it does say  n*gger,  after all   but contrary to assertions made by Nugent and his future hunting buddy in the comments that the vehicle is real, it s not. It s just more garbage that Donald Trump s fans, one-fifth of whom think it was a bad idea to end slavery, can pass around and enjoy as they discuss their plans to lynch black people.Last year, Nugent praised the use of the n-word in a column on World Net Daily titled  Don t be niggardly with language. After the President used the word  n*gger  while speaking about how racism is still an issue in our society, Nugent wrote: Well, there you have it. The Honest Society is a rather large and growing club, clan if you will, that is not afraid of speaking honestly without fear of politically correct word nazi s going berserk. Nugent proclaimed that the use of  n-word  in place of the full thing is the  epitome of political correctness gone mad,  going on to explain that  the word n*gger has historically been used in a powerfully positive way  in some scenarios. He went on to proclaim that society shunning the word  n*gger  does nothing to help the  criminality  of  blacks  in Chicago and  other urban hellzones.  Besides, he says, black people use the word and it is  the very definition of racism  not to let white people spew it as much as they want with no repercussions.Nugent once adopted a 17-year-old girl so that he could have sex with her. This has no relation to anything current, but it seemed like a good note on which to end.Featured image via screengrab ",

Prepare for liberal heads to explode in 5 4 3 2 1According to a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted on the eve of the first anniversary of Trump s historic election, 82 percent of those who say they supported Trump last year would vote for him again if they had to do it over. That s slightly more than those who say they would vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton again   78 percent   if they had the chance.Only 7 percent of Trump voters and 8 percent of Clinton voters say they would vote for a different candidate if they could complete their 2016 ballot again.Trump s supporters have largely rallied around the president, despite his poor overall approval ratings, the chaos of his first year in office and the ongoing investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.But there are worrying signs for Trump that voters are less inclined to give him a second term three years from now if he decides to run for reelection.Those red flags go beyond the natural, downward trajectory of most new presidents. Like Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush saw their parties lose governorships in both New Jersey and Virginia the year after their first elections as president. But both Obama and Bush had job-approval ratings over 50 percent at this point.While most Trump voters would back him in a 2016 do-over, some defect when asked whether they will vote for Trump or a generic, unnamed Democrat in 2020. About three-quarters of Trump voters, 76 percent, back Trump in the 2020 matchup, while 8 percent would support the Democrat.  Politico",

While speaking to political leaders in Africa, he pointed out that he was  a pretty good president. I think if I ran, I could win.

        "text": "We hear so much talk from the Left about working to help foreigners  assimilate. Yet here we have a prominent Imam calling for the segregation of Muslims from their host nation. How is this okay? Shaykh Said Rageah (     ) was born in Somalia and in the late 80s and moved to North America. Rageah has a Bachelor s in Islamic studies and a Masters in Shari ah and he has had several posts over the years, including: founder of Masjid Huda in Montreal and Masjid Aya in Maryland, advisor for Muslim Youth magazine, and member in the Aqsa Association.He is also the founder of both Muslim Magazine and Al Aqsa Association, and served as the Chaplain at both the University of Calgary and the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT). He served as an Imam at the Abu Hurairah Mosque in Toronto, the Chairman for the Journey of Faith Conference and as an instructor for the AlMaghrib Institute.In a sermon delivered at Abu Hurairah Centre in Toronto (the video was uploaded to YouTube on February 8, 2009), Imam Rageah called on Canadian Muslims to unite and translate their demography into a political and economic power that is necessary to make the government allow Muslims to implement the Islamic Law (Sharia) in their communities and to change the foreign policy.Rageah spoke in favour of following the example of the Sikh neighbourhood in Edmonton, Alberta, by bringing the Muslim community to live together in one area in which the authorities will not be able to make any decision without the approval of the Muslims.He urges Muslims to hire only Muslim workers, to buy products or services only from Muslim-owned businesses and to avoid advertising with media outlets owned by kafir, meaning unbeliever or infidel. In this way, he maintained, Canadian Muslims can strengthen themselves and live according to Islam.The following is a transcript of segments from Rageah s sermon:  With four, five [hundred] thousand Muslims you can create the most powerful lobby in Canada  with that number of Muslims you can create one of the strongest Muslim business in Toronto   If you just put our resources, if we put our resources together, if we can work together as an Ummah [Muslim nation] we can change a lot As Muslims, we are scattered all over the city. You have people living in Brampton, you have people living in Mississauga, you have people living in Whitby, you have people living in Richmond Hill. Imagine if we all get together in one area. In the City of Edmonton, the Sikh, Sikh, they live in one neighbourhood and nothing can be changed or done without their approval. We here we may as well benefit from the system that they have here. What can you do with unity? A lot. You can change a lot. You can change the foreign policy of this country. You can change how the Muslims think. You can even when need help, when you need help you call Muslim for your need you will help the Muslim community Brothers in the masjid [Mosque] right now, they are coming up with the magazine or newspaper called Ummah Times. What Ummah Times is that? Ummah Times is advertising all your businesses all the Muslim businesses [are] Ummah.  All you need to do   I will never advertise with a kafir [unbeliever, infidel], there you go. I hear some advertisements giving to 680 News $5,000. Before your Muslim brothers $50 and $80 or $100 we think twice before we do it. Unless we work together, the day we need a truck driver we know where to find truck drivers. The day that I need a cab I should have a number of a Muslim cab it s ok, pick me up. When I wan to see a doctor, only Muslim doctor. When I want to hire someone only Muslim worker. Then we can strengthen ourselves. This is the way and this is the only way we can exist in the society, living according to Islam. When the Sharia [Islamic Law], when the government of Toronto, Ontario gave us a break and said: deal your internal affairs based on your Sharia [Islamic Law] we did not go and say: Those few people are Ismailis and Ahmadis, they are not even Muslims. Why would they speak on behalf of Muslims. But, we say no, we keep quiet and see and watch what happens, and then the result was that they said  we will never allow you to rule yourselves, your internal affairs based on the Shariah My brothers in faith [     ], anything that happens in your Muslim community, in the City of Toronto, anything that can be done, five hundred thousand Muslims that is a great number, large number, you can do a lot, work together. Let s be an Ummah [nation] Take your children to Islamic schools. Take your vehicle to Muslim owned business. If you buy a vehicle make sure there is a Muslim business or car dealer that sells cars. If you want to do anything just ask if that individual is a Muslim or not. If he is not, then look for a Muslim, because I m sure you ll find a Muslim. I m sure you ll find a Muslim in that field    O Allah, Raise the standing of Islam and the Muslims [       ], and humiliate the infidels and the polytheists.  [     ]Via: Creeping Sharia",

He s a master projector and this  drug test  poppycock is no different. He s been sniffing constantly through the debates, and many have asked if he may be on cocaine or something else.When White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was just asked about a potential drug test, he said: You re telling me that the candidate who snorted his way through the first two debates is accusing the other candidate of taking drugs?

Is he sick? Does he lack stamina? Is he taking drugs to stay awake? Who s really to know, but since Trump did raise the question of drug tests, maybe we should find out. Maybe he s saying it to deflect because everyone has been questioning him.See, two can play at this conspiracy theory game.How about we stick to the issues?

Here s what I want, I want to get him. Oh, I would love to have Ron Burkle. And it s great to have you Ron. But I really mean that, if you want to get involved in negotiating NAFTA, I like it. Because we re renegotiating NAFTA, Ron. The U.S. is entering its fourth round of NAFTA talks, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s visit to the U.S. tomorrow overlapping that. Trump hates NAFTA in part because he wants trade deals that are heavily even unfairly weighted in our direction. He has threatened to walk away from these talks because he s not getting what he wants.Worse, like the Paris Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he thinks terminating our involvement in international agreements is the best way to get his idea of a good deal: I happen to think that Nafta will have to be terminated if we re going to make it good.

Washington ExaminerThe Wisconsin Elections Commission agreed Monday to begin a recount of the presidential election on Thursday but was sued by Green Party candidate Jill Stein after the agency declined to require county officials to recount the votes by hand.It will be a race to finish the recount in time to meet a daunting federal deadline, and the lawsuit could delay the process. Under state law, the recount must begin this week as long as Stein or another candidate pays the $3.5 million estimated cost of the recount by Tuesday, election officials said.Also Monday, Stein filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania to force a recount there and her supporters began filing recount requests at the precinct level in the Keystone State. Stein  who received just a tiny piece of the national vote  also plans to ask for a recount in Michigan on Wednesday.Unless Stein wins her lawsuit in Dane County Circuit Court, officials in each of Wisconsin s 72 counties would decide on their own whether to do their recounts of the 2.98 million statewide votes by machine or by hand, with dozens of counties expected to hand count the paper ballots.

        "text": "Justice the Obama way Instead of investigating whether Planned Parenthood illegally trafficked baby body parts, Obama s DOJ is targeting the group behind the undercover videosThe U.S. Department of Justice announced plans to investigate the group that produced undercover videos showing Planned Parenthood employees admitting that they harvest and sell organs ripped from the bodies aborted babies. Politico reported the news of the coming DOJ investigation earlier today:JUSTICE TO PROBE CENTER FOR MEDICAL PROGRESS   While congressional committees investigate Planned Parenthood s practices, the Justice Department agreed to look into whether the group that released the sting videos obtained the footage legally. In response to a request by House Democrats, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Wednesday afternoon that Justice would  review all of the information and determine what the appropriate steps moving forward would be.  Planned Parenthood has staunchly defended its practices and claims that the Center for Medical Progress illegally obtained its footage, then excessively edited it to misrepresent what the organization does. The DOJ investigation of the Center for Medical Progress, which, unlike Planned Parenthood, is not in the business of killing healthy, viable unborn babies in order to sell their organs for cash, was announced after several Democratic lawmakers called for the organization to be targeted:Four Democrats in Congress   Reps. Jan Schakowsky, Zoe Lofgren, Jerry Nadler, and Yvette Clarke   have written to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and California Attorney General Kamala Harris, asking them to open investigations into the Center for Medical Progress. The Democrats say the videos were filmed as part of an  elaborate scheme    using  fake identification  and without the approval of the Planned Parenthood doctor who appears in them. It s interesting that Lynch decided so early to make a statement about the group. There are certainly more videos to come, and if Planned Parenthood s panicked press releases are any indication, the footage may be far more damaging than anything that s been revealed thus far. However, given the abject politicization of multiple agencies under Obama s command   including the Internal Revenue Service, which targeted conservative non-profits, and the DOJ, which has been hesitant to investigate Obama allies   it seems unlikely that Lynch and those who report to her will ever crack down on Abortion, Inc.Via: The Federalist",

        "text": "At the beginning of the year, a new law went into effect in Texas authorizing  responsible gun owners  to carry their weapons around pretty much anywhere as long as they have gone through the incredibly easy process of obtaining a concealed carry permit. As the NRA tells us   constantly   these individuals, these  good guys with guns,  are ready to leap into action at the first sign of danger to protect the innocent from  bad guys with guns. Unfortunately, the problem is that the  good guys  often can become  bad guys  the moment they get a little bit angry  something we saw unfold on Friday and Saturday in Uvalde, Texas. Four people are dead after a 19-hour standoff with police at a trailer park.  It s a mess in there right now,  a Uvalde County Sheriff s Office deputy told News 4 San Antonio.Details are scarce, but police have announced that no officers were hurt in the battle with an unannounced number of gunmen and/or women. Uvalde County Sheriff s had responded to reports of shots fired at the trailer park. After police arrived, the suspects opened fire on responding officers   none of whom were hurt, fortunately. People in the trailer park and in neighboring homes were not permitted into the area while the blood battle between  good guys with guns  and police.Unfortunately, the mass proliferation of guns in the United States creates a situation where no one is ever truly safe   not in their homes, not in church, not walking down the street, or anywhere else. The lie that a  good guy with a gun  will save the day is a gross misrepresentation of reality. In fact, they re just as likely to score a headshot on the person they are  saving  as to actually save someone.While many argue that it s their right to carry their self-confidence on their hips, the fact is that keeping a gun around actually makes you less safe than having no gun at all  and then, of course, there s the chance that any  responsible gun owner  could snap at any time and start shooting. While it s true that we don t know what sparked this shootout, we can safely assume that the people who turned their guns on police surely thought of themselves as the  good guys.

        "text": "This church congregation should be ashamed.After all, it was a year ago that Watermark Community Church sent a letter to Jason Thomas formally rejecting him as a member of the church simply because he is gay. In our attempt to shepherd you, we have recognized a destructive pattern that prohibits us in caring for you and playing the role you desire for us to have in your life,  the letter stated.  Specifically, your desire to actively participate in a same-sex relationship with another man, and your unwillingness to heed biblical counsel from your church to turn from that relationship, has made it exceedingly difficult to shepherd you during this time. The church goes on to claim in the letter that they  value the way God has uniquely formed you,  but wants him to change by following the church s counsel and to meet a person named Brandon who has similar homosexual feelings. Notice how the church literally outed Brandon?Anyway, Jason clearly was not welcome back to the church unless he agreed to be someone he is not so he stayed far away. One year later, Jason is happy and is comfortable with who he is and with his sexuality. So he wrote a reply to Watermark Community Church informing them that their choice to reject him was the best thing that could have happened to him.Here s is the full letter via Pink News.Dear Watermark Community Church,Today I celebrate a very interesting anniversary with you. It was exactly one year ago when you told me that I was no longer worthy to serve, be in a community group, and be a member of your church.I spent years in your church battling against my homosexuality. I believed with all my heart that God would change me; I prayed for change almost daily. But when I wasn t able to change, you turned your back on me.You say our  sin  is not unique, but you treat us in a unique manner; this is unacceptable behaviour. We are actual people that have actual feelings.Here we are a year later and you are still doing to others what you did to me. You are tarnishing the name of God to Christians and non-Christians alike; you should be ashamed of yourselves! Do not forget, Jesus was angry with people just like you who said certain groups of people were not worthy to be followers of Him.Thank you for removing yourself from my life! I am who God made me to be. I cannot change my sexual orientation and nor would I want to. I now have internal peace and happiness unlike ever before.Jason ThomasIndeed, while this church is busy persecuting people for being gay, there are almost certainly many members of the church who commit adultery or other sins on a daily basis who are not being rejected by the church like Jason. Even the church elders are not without sin yet they are busy hypocritically casting stones at people who are gay.Watermark responded to Jason by telling the Dallas News that,  An individual s formal relationship with us as a member is only changed when someone no longer desires to resist sin and refuses our help, care and encouragement. Even if someone s formal membership status is removed, they are always welcome to attend Watermark and be reminded of the grace and truth of our savior Jesus Christ. Yeah, that s complete bullshit and is exactly why more and more people are no longer attending church. Jesus said  love thy neighbor as thyself,  but apparently this church isn t a fan of Jesus  teachings, which did not include ostracizing gay people.Featured Image: i.ytimg.com",

        "title": " Here\u2019s Why Conservatives Are Silent About 2016 Cop Killer Data",
        "text": "Police in this country had a great run. Let s face it   if you remember the 1970s, 1980s   anytime before 600 million cameras went online nationwide, a policeman s word was gold. Now, with an increasing number of people filming nonstop and the introduction of mandatory body cams for more conscientious departments, police can t simply corroborate with each other, sign a report and move on with their day. They re beginning to be held accountable for their actions. Ironically it all began with the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, which wasn t recorded. Multiple witnesses said they saw Brown shot while he was standing a safe distance away and unarmed. A grand jury failed to indict Officer Darren Wilson for Brown s death.Thus sparked the #BlackLivesMatter movement, as more and more it became evident that the narrative, pretty much nationwide, plays out differently for black men than for anyone else in society. They are killed more often. Murdered in cold blood in many cases, black men are routinely beaten after they submit if they aren t shot for looking scary and black first. Conservatives fired back with #BlueLivesMatter and started talking about all of the cops killed by black people ever.And so here we are. Politics has managed to take yet another issue all Americans should be behind and turned into a political circus. Conservatives, who are the political ideology that inspires standoffs with federal agents and wildlife refuge occupations, suddenly believe that if you don t conform with the law and do whatever a police officer tells you, you should be executed on the street. Why? Because the issue is black people. Make it about white people and all of a sudden they re holed up in their bunker with 24,000 rounds of ammunition and a pallet of canned peaches.Conservatives have been awfully quiet this year about cop killings, however, even though they are up substantially. At this time last year there were ten police officers killed in the line of duty, this year there have been 17. Certainly we should hearing about the  thugs  who murdered these public servants? No? 71 percent of the cops killed this year were killed by white men. Not scary black guys wearing bandanas, shooting at them with Uzis from the blacked out windows of an Escalade on 24-inch rims. White guys. Nutjobs, psychopaths, career criminals; come to find out white men are pretty darned dangerous   and they don t need Uzis.So where s the news coverage of the major increase in cop killings? Where s the outrage? Where is #BlueLivesMatter? Do blue lives only matter when they re killed by black men or do they matter all the time? The double standard is so easy to see it s ridiculous. #BlackLivesMatter isn t about cops or all lives. It s not about being an equal part of something when you re not treated as equal. Black men are routinely treated as dangerous, often at the end of a young, hair-trigger finger.Featured image by WP/Getty Images",

So, while speaking at a tech conference in San Francisco, Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid into Trump   hard.Zuckerberg said: I m starting to see people and nations turning inward against this idea of a connected world. I hear fearful voices talking about building walls  It takes courage to choose hope over fear. Instead of building walls we can help build bridges. Instead of dividing people we can connect people. We do it one person at a time, one connection at time. That s why I think the work we re doing together is more important than it has ever been before. This, of course, is a direct jab at Trump s ridiculous idea that the United States should build a giant wall spanning the entire length of the U.S./Mexico border. And Zuckerberg is right   we shouldn t be building walls, we should be tearing them down and building relationships that will foster future growth and development between the neighboring nations.Zuckerberg also said: Our lives are connected. Whether we re welcoming a refugee fleeing war or an immigrant seeking new opportunity. Whether we re coming together to fight global diseases like Ebola or to fight climate change, we have the courage to see that the path forward is to bring people together, not push people apart. Which is exactly right. We don t need a leader of our nation that is going to build walls to keep the world out, and in essence, keep us in. This sort of isolationist, xenophobic and nonsensical fear-baiting serves absolutely no one. It doesn t keep us safer, and it most certainly doesn t foster relationships with the rest of the world. Hopefully the nation will come together this November who will seek to build bridges and not walls.Featured Photo by Adam Berry/Getty Images via Flickr",

Well, this is likely something that people are just casual, general election political observers don t know. But, certainly pundits and political nerds knew this right away, and the non-partisan fact-checking operation Politifact was ready to call Pence out on his many, many lies. Here are just a few highlights:Pence:  Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement. We rated this claim Mostly False. In 2011, the Obama administration was negotiating with the Iraqi government to give American troops immunity prosecution by Iraqis   a touchy political issue.There s debate on whether the Americans could have worked out a deal, but Pence is wrong to suggest Clinton is to blame. The key decisions and discussions took place between the White House itself and Iraqi leaders.Pence:  They want to expand (Obamacare) into a single-payer program. Clinton and Kaine have proposed a public option   a government-sponsored insurance plan   but they have not proposed single-payer. Clinton has consistently resisted going in that direction and instead proposes to work to prevent the repeal of Obamacare and try to improve on it.Pence s claim is Mostly False.Pence: Donald Trump  never said that  more nations should get nuclear weapons.Mostly False. Trump has said some countries, namely Japan and South Korea, might be  better off  if they were to develop nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea. However, he has also said   often in the same interview   that he opposes nuclear proliferation in general.Pence:  We delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.This  ransom  line, which we ve previously heard from Trump, is Mostly False. Iran received the payment on the same day that American prisoners were released, but experts said this was not ransom. The United States owed Iran the money as part of a decades-long financial dispute.Pence:  Less than 10 cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes. This is a repeated Republican talking point and it s inaccurate. While it s true that the foundation gives away in grants a small fraction of its resources, about 87 percent of its expenses go toward services it provides directly.And that s just a few. The entire analysis of the truthfulness of the vice presidential candidates  claims can be found here at Politifact.Overall, Mike Pence had to walk a very difficult tight rope Tuesday night. While he might have won when it comes to a calm, cool style, he failed miserably on substance. Perhaps that is because when it comes down to it, his running mate is a racist, misogynist, pathological liar and a dangerous demagogue who should never be anywhere near the Oval Office. To that end, Pence s strategy seemed to be to insist that the more outrageous things that Donald Trump has said throughout this horrific travesty of a presidential campaign aren t true, and to run away from clearly indefensible positions. Or maybe he s just drank the Kool-Aid they regularly serve up at Trump Tower, and actually thinks he is telling the truth and being reasonable.Either way, it s insanity. Thank goodness for fact-checkers to help set the American people straight in this nightmare of a presidential election season.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",

Rather, we need to focus on coming together and tear down the barriers that have been holding so many citizens back for so long.Hillary went after Donald Trump s ridiculous slogan head-on, and simply told it like it is: Despite what you hear, we don t need to  make America great again.  America has never stopped being great. But, we do need to make America whole again. Instead of building walls, we need to be tearing down barriers. We need to show by everything that we do that we are in this together. While Trump is focused on dividing us and relying on racism at the polls, Hillary is focused on bringing us together and pushing as forward.

        "text": "The folks at Fox News are getting crazier on a minute by minute basis and although it s quite sad that this organization calls itself a news outlet, it s nonetheless quite entertaining watching Fox eat its own.In the latest of her rants, so-called   judge  and Donald Trump supporter Jeanine Pirro is ticked off at her cohort at Fox, nut-job extraordinaire Karl Rove and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus  for their recent statements about a contested Republican convention and Donald Trump.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qINfdIhqzXM]Pirro usually reserves her outrageous statements for Democrats or Muslims, but this time she unleashed her fury on Rove and Priebus for their perceived anti-Trump stances. In response to Rove s suggestion that it would be acceptable for the Republicans to take the nomination away from Trump, even if he goes into the convention with the most delegates but not enough to secure the nomination, unhinged the Fox contributor. She said: The Republican establishment, desperate to stop Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, is still working to nullify our vote. If ever there were a time to not take away our vote, it s now   at a time when more people than ever are invested and voting. You want to keep your status quo   the one where one hand washes the other, and we pay for the soap. Pirro also reacted to Rove s remarks where he said a  fresh face  may be needed to beat Clinton in November. Pirro said: You want a fresh face? Aren t you the guy who kept bringing us one Bush after another? Continuing on her tangent, Pirro also attacked RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, calling him out for refusing to tell Sean Hannity  whether the presidential nominee for Republicans will be one of the top vote-getters   Trump or Cruz. Pirro said: Whatever happened to  your vote matters?  Not only is that infuriating, it is un-American. Watching all of these so-called conservatives and Republicans implode before our very eyes comes at just the right time as we head into the elections for November because it helps clarify that the GOP of today should not be in charge of this country.

        "title": " What Trump Promised Carson For An Endorsement Could Very Well Land Him In Jail (VIDEO)",
        "text": "Watching people line up behind Donald Trump is concerning in and of itself, but we may finally have an explanation as to why certain people have been so quick to endorse the Republican presidential frontrunner after dropping out of the race themselves.First, it was New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who had been slamming Trump his whole campaign, but then turned around to endorse him. And now, Dr. Ben Carson has backed the real estate mogul. However, Carson may have just revealed why he actually threw his support behind Trump   and the reason may actually be illegal.While being interviewed on Newsmax, Carson seemed to imply that he was offered an  advisory  position in Trump s potential administration in return for an endorsement. One big problem with that, though. Offering a role in exchange for an endorsement is against federal law.Carson said: I didn t see a path for Kasich, who I like, or for Rubio, who I like. As far as Cruz is concerned, I don t think that he s gonna be able to draw independents and Democrats unless he has some kind of miraculous change  Is there another scenario that I would have preferred? Yes. But that scenario isn t available. However, expanding on what cemented his decision, Carson said: I will be doing things as well   Certainly in an advisory capacity [in Trump s administration] We haven t handled out all the details but it is very important that we work together in this country  Again, I m not going to reveal any details about it right now because all of this is still very liquid. Which leads any person with common sense to realize Trump clearly offered Carson a role in exchange for his support. However, according to the federal legal code: Whoever, being a candidate, directly or indirectly promises or pledges the appointment, or the use of his influence or support for the appointment of any person to any public or private position or employment, for the purpose of procuring support in his candidacy shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if the violation was willful, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both. Carson very may well have led to the chance of federal charges being filed against Trump. Will that happen? Likely not. Should it? Most definitely. Trump is gaming the system and seems to be promising favors. It s scandalous at best, and most definitely illegal.Here s the video via Think Progress:Featured image via YouTube",

We currently have a person running for President of the United States who is not only condoning violence, but instigating and encouraging it. Recent Donald Trump rallies have turned into something very reminiscent of Nazi Germany from the 1930s and 40s. If this doesn t terrify you, wake up. If you approve of this, you re part of the problem.In yet another move to motivate his band of merry morons who are clearly unhinged and will do his bidding at a moment s notice, Trump tweets out a direct threat to Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders as well as his supporters who attend his rallies. The real estate mogul seems to think that Sanders is lying when he says that his supporters aren t told to go to Trump events, so he took that as his cue to threaten Sanders back.Trump said: Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren t told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours! Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2016This threat isn t even thinly veiled. Telling someone to  be careful  insinuates harm may follow. He s literally giving permission and telling his version of brownshirts to go to Sanders rallies. This tweet will most certainly encourage several of his supporters to go. This is getting very scary, folks, and Trump needs to be held accountable for inciting violence.Bernie Sanders has since spoken out against Trump and his ridiculous allegations. The Sanders campaign just retweeted this to make the message clear. Bernie said while on ABC News: Well, I think anybody who understands Mr. Trump s campaign knows that he tells the truth very, very rarely, and I m afraid that on this occasion, he s lying again. First of all, he calls me a communist, obviously that s a lie. Then he says that our campaign is organizing disruptions of his rallies, that s a lie  We have millions of supporters out there, and clearly some of them were at that rally along with many many other protesters.

        "title": " WATCH: Republican Senator Lashes Out At CNN Hosts After Being Called Out For Supreme Court Hypocrisy",
        "text": "Republicans are desperately trying to convince everyone that what they did to Merrick Garland was totally normal.On Sunday, Mitch McConnell pathetically defended his party s refusal to hold a confirmation hearing for President Obama s Supreme Court nominee by repeating the claim that it s Senate  tradition  to not confirm nominees during an election year. He also made the childish claim that Republicans did it because Democrats would have done it, even though Democrats have never done such a thing.What Republicans did to Merrick Garland was unprecedented and a total disgrace of the Constitution.But Orrin Hatch picked up where McConnell left off by using the same pathetic defense during an interview on CNN Monday.After being asked about what Republicans will do if Democrats block Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, Hatch whined and accused Democrats of  politicizing  the confirmation process  while pretending that his own party didn t politicize it throughout 2016 when they refused to even grant Garland a hearing. They re politicizing this whole process,  Hatch said.  This is a guy who is a mainstream conservative, which they hate, they don t like that. And of course, they are still upset about my other friend, Merrick Garland. But the Republicans had every right to delay that within a presidential year. CNN host John Berman called out Hatch s hypocrisy. But they look at you and say that s a double standard,  Berman responded.  You call Judge Gorsuch one of the most qualified judges ever to be nominated. Almost everyone said the same thing about Merrick Garland, including you. Indeed, in 2010, Hatch referred to Garland as a  consensus nominee  and said there is  no question  that he would be easily confirmed to the high court if nominated. Garland even complained in support of Garland in 2016 by whining about President Obama s choice before Garland was chosen. The president told me several times he s going to name a moderate [to fill the court vacancy], but I don t believe him. [Obama] could easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man. He probably won t do that because this appointment is about the election. So I m pretty sure he ll name someone the [liberal Democratic base] wants. President Obama made Hatch choke on those words by picking Garland. So there seems to be a double standard where you re saying, it was alright last year when we for political reasons halted the nomination of Merrick Garland,  Berman continued.  But it s not okay this year when Democrats try to halt the nomination of Judge Gorsuch. Hatch responded to Berman by lashing out with a desperate defense of how Republicans behaved in 2016 towards Garland. I ll just tell you straight up, that s total B.S.,  Hatch said.  I can t go back in time and show you any case where in a presidential election year they allowed a Supreme Court justice to be nominated unless both sides agreed. And both sides didn t agree. It was every right of [Majority Leader Mitch McConnell] and Senate Republicans to say we re not going to do this in a presidential year. And at that time, keep in mind, it looked as though Hillary was a sure winner and we would have gotten an even more liberal judge than that one. But that was a stand on principle. Not some new barbaric thing that some have tried to make it. Here s the video via YouTube:Let s make something clear. What Hatch and his fellow Republicans in the Senate did to Merrick Garland was totally unprecedented. They not only rejected Garland after previously praising him, they even refused to grant him a confirmation hearing. That has never happened. Republicans were so unbelievably partisan that Antonin Scalia s body was not even cold yet when they declared that they would refuse to confirm any nominee picked by President Obama. And that brings us yet again to the Republican claim that it s  tradition  for the Senate to not confirm Supreme Court nominees during an election year.That s complete bullshit. As it turns out, the last one occurred only 29 years ago when the Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988 during Ronald Reagan s last year in office.It also happened in 1956 when Dwight Eisenhower nominated William Brennan. The Senate confirmed him despite it being an election year.In 1940, also an election year, Franklin Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the Supreme Court and the Senate confirmed him.So contrary to Republican claims, the tradition is that nominees can be and are confirmed despite whether it s an election year or not.That means Hatch is lying to cover his ass because he knows he and his fellow Republicans are complete hypocrites and now that their hypocrisy is coming back to bite them on the ass they want to play the victim.Featured image via screenshot",

        "text": "You seriously can t make this stuff up Wouldn t it be great if we had a real and honest media, and this was the top story of the day today?Zero Hedge   Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton facilitated the transfer a highly enriched uranium (HEU) previously confiscated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) during a 2006  nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one Russian national and several Georgian accomplices,  a newly leaked classified cable shows.So-called  background  information was provided in the cable which gave vague details on a 2006 nuclear smuggling sting operation in which the U.S. government took possession of some HEU previously owned by the Russians. Over two years ago Russia requested a ten-gram sample of highly enriched uranium (HEU) seized in early 2006 in Georgia during a nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one Russian national and several Georgian accomplices. The seized HEU was transferred to U.S. custody and is being held at a secure DOE facility. The secret  action request,  dated Aug. 17, 2009, was sent out by Secretary of State Clinton and was addressed to the United States Ambassador to Georgia Embassy Tbilisi, the Russian Embassy, and Ambassador John Beyrle.It proposed that FBI Director Robert Mueller be the one that personally conducts the transfer a 10-gram sample of HEU to Russian law enforcement sources during a secret  plane-side  meeting on a  tarmac  in the early fall of 2009. We require that the transfer of this material be conducted at the airport, on the tarmac near by the plane, upon arrival of the Director s aircraft. Gateway Pundit    The cable also states that  Given Russia s reluctance to act so far, FBI Mueller s delivery of this sample will underscore to Russia our commitment to follow through on this case.  It continues in stating,  Embassy Moscow is requested to alert at the highest appropriate level the Russian Federation that FBI Director Mueller plans to deliver the HEU sample once he arrives to Moscow on September 21. The cable summarizes that,  We regret that the April visit by Director Mueller could not take place due to a scheduling conflict.  and makes a final request that,  We require that the transfer of this material be conducted at the airport, on the tarmac near by the plane, upon arrival of the Director s aircraft. Now knowing that the Obama Administration and Hillary Clinton hid the FBI investigation into the Uranium One deal, this cable brings on new meaning and leads to numerous questions.Why did Obama and Clinton agree to provide this uranium delivered by Mueller to Russia in the first place?An article by the Atlantic from April 2008 tells the fascinating story of the smuggler in the country of Georgia who was arrested trying to sell uranium to potential buyers. The smuggler, Oleg Vladimirovich Khintsagov, on January 31, 2006, was apprehended by authorities carrying 100 grams of highly enriched uranium tucked into a plastic bag in his tattered leather coat.A sample of the uranium captured during this sting operation was provided to the Russians who analyzed it and determined that it was indeed highly enriched uranium (HEU). In the Atlantic article, it states that the Russians at first didn t respond to requests from Georgia on the uranium and at no time asked for the uranium back. As a matter of fact, the Russians worked hard to deny that the uranium came from Russia in the first place. So why did the Obama Administration hand deliver 10 grams of HEU to Russia in 2009 and when did Russia begin asking for another sample of the uranium and why did the memo not mention that the Russians had already obtained a sample of this uranium and determined that it was HEU?Another question is why did Clinton s Secretary of State request that FBI Director Mueller deliver the sample of HEU to Russia and why was the transfer in April canceled and postponed to September?Of all people, why would the Head of the FBI be selected to transfer uranium to Russia? It would seem that the US has a number of individuals who could perform this transfer and it would seem that FBI Director Mueller would have enough on his plate in the US. When Mueller couldn t make the transfer in April the transfer was postponed to September so Mueller could be there.The fact that Mueller needed to perform the transfer should raise numerous red flags. It s been widely reported about Mueller s conflicts of interest with his recent appointment as special counsel in the Russia investigation.According to The Hill, before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. For entire story: The HillThe investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017, The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are.  Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election. ",

        "title": " CONFIRMED: Special Counsel Mueller Is Actually Investigating Donald Trump",
        "text": "Whether or not Trump obstructed justice in his interactions with James Comey has been the subject of hot debate ever since Comey was fired from his position as FBI director on May 9. Now, senior intelligence officials familiar with Special Counsel Mueller s investigation have confirmed that he s looking into whether or not Trump actually did obstruct justice.To conservatives who believe that obstruction of justice requires specific intent and a specific act, the whole idea that Trump obstructed justice simply by doing what he s done is preposterous. Nevertheless, obstruction of justice occurs when someone aware of a proceeding tries to interfere with it:[O]bstructions of justice aimed at judicial officers, grand and petit jurors, and witnesses. The law makes it a crime to threaten, intimidate, or retaliate against these participants in a criminal or civil proceeding. In addition, [it is] illegal to attempt the bribery of an official to alter the outcome of a judicial proceeding.Besides these specific prohibitions, the law contains the Omnibus Clause, which states that a person who  corruptly or by threats of force, or by threatening letter or communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice  is guilty of the crime of obstruction of justice. This clause offers broad protection to the  due administration of justice.  Federal courts have read this clause expansively to proscribe any conduct that interferes with the judicial process. The way that Trump communicated with Comey about the investigation into Michael Flynn and Russia, and then again in the way he so abruptly fired Comey and virtually admitted that he did so because of the Russia probe, could fall under this definition. All that s really needed is for the investigation to prove  that there was a pending federal judicial proceeding, the defendant knew of the proceeding, and the defendant had corrupt intent to interfere with or attempted to interfere with the proceeding. Prior to Comey s firing, the FBI had convened a grand jury in the Flynn investigation, which issued subpoenas for Michael Flynn s business records around the same time that Comey was fired. As CNN put it, the grand jury represented the first major escalation in the broader Russian probe.Mueller s office plans to interview various intelligence officials soon, which suggests that Mueller s views on the matter are more in line with the idea that he was actively trying to impede Comey s work, rather than just a disagreement between Comey and Trump about what was said.A spokesman for Trump s lawyer, of course, expressed outrage that this has made the news:The FBI leak of information regarding the president is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal. As we know, Trump and his supporters repeatedly claim that the real story is how all these leaks are happening and why nobody does anything about them. While leaks are a problem, they are not the main story. The Trump administration uses them as a deflection.It s not clear whether Mueller will actually pursue the charge of obstruction of justice. However, if he does, it will ultimately be Congress  decision as to what to do with it   not the DOJ s. And Congressional Republicans seem to be adamant that they won t impeach. However, if Mueller is able to lay out a convincing enough case, then Congress may find itself without any choice but to impeach.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",

        "text": "Donald Trump is more than likely leaning toward picking retired Lt. General Michael Flynn as his vice-presidential running mate after this.During an interview on The Week with guest host Martha Raddatz, Flynn referred to undocumented immigrants as  illegals. Flynn is currently on Trump s shortlist of possible running mates so he made sure to match the Republican nominee s anti-immigration rhetoric.Raddatz asked Flynn if all undocumented immigrants should be rounded up and deported. Flynn not only replied by using what many consider to be a racial slur, by using it he suggested that Trump would round them all up and send them back across the border as he builds his massive and expensive wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. Let s talk about immigration,  Raddatz began.  Let me ask you immigration: should all undocumented immigrants be deported? So undocumented or illegal?  Flynn asked in some attempt for clarification. Undocumented, illegal  Raddatz replied.Then Flynn proceeded to lecture Raddatz. Are they here illegally? I mean, if they re here illegally, then it s illegal. I mean, again, back to my very first point, the rule of law in this country is probably the single biggest strategic advantage that we have, above and beyond all other countries in the world. And we cannot allow the rule of law to break down. Here s the video via YouTube. The anti-immigrant remarks begin at the 5:18 mark:While the act of crossing the border without permission is illegal, the people doing it are not. Actions are illegal, not people. But because they are inherently racist, conservatives prefer using this term to describe Hispanic people whom they do not want in America.That s why the correct term to use is  undocumented. Elsewhere in the interview, Flynn also accused Hillary Clinton of blaming all white people for the killing of innocent black people by police officersLt. General Michael Flynn served his country honorably during his many years of service, some of which were under President Obama, who appointed him as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012.He is also a registered Democrat, although he claims that today s Democratic Party isn t the same one he grew up with, which is weird considering Democrats are fighting for social justice, women s rights, and civil rights just as they have been doing since Flynn was a child in the 1960s, so it s a little bit of a head-scratcher as to why he would want to ruin his reputation by agreeing to be vetted as a potential running mate for a racist bigoted Republican candidate like Donald Trump.Featured Image: Screenshot",

        "text": "Fox News host Megyn Kelly is all too familiar with Donald Trump s bullying tactics. She d endured several of them during the presidential debates and Trump continued to attack her over Twitter throughout his campaign. Now that Trump has been elected as the next President of the United States, Kelly is breaking her silence and coming forward about the threats she d kept to herself   until now.In a USA Today interview published on Tuesday, Kelly spoke about her new memoir,  Settle for More  in which she talks about how Trump relentlessly harassed her and compromised her job by whining to the executives at Fox News after she dared to ask him about his treatment of women during a primary debate. And when Kelly reported on an older allegation of spousal rape against him, Trump resorted to his teenage tactics and warned he would  unleash  his Twitter account on her. Seriously.After Kelly reported on the rape allegation made by Trump s ex-wife Ivana, she said Trump personally called her and said: I almost unleashed my beautiful Twitter account on you, and I still may. Spoken like a true psychopath. The unfortunate thing is that Trump actually made good on his threat   he spent several months attacking and mocking Kelly after that incident. He was so brutal in his attacks that his supporters were even threatening Kelly. Some even showed up at her house. Kelly said: (Trump) couldn t let it go for so long and there was a time when I wondered if he d ever let it go. The way Trump terrorized and harassed women during his presidential campaign is unprecendented. We ve never seen such unprofessional, blatantly misogynistic behavior from a presidential candidate before. Unfortunately, America s children are learning from it, and he s set an awful example.

Why it matters: Trump is acknowledging defeat and now, rather than support Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s push to repeal with out a replacement bill, he s decided to let Barack Obama s Affordable Care Act remain the law of the land. fast forward and McConnell s straight repeal plan collapses with 3  no votes.  The three no votes came from three women who should really be in the D column: By Tuesday afternoon, three Republican senators   all women   had come out against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s plan to push a vote on a clean Obamacare repeal bill   enough to sink it altogether.

In case you are not in on the joke, Vermin Supreme runs in every presidential election. He is a performance artist who pulls stunts that satirize the U.S. election system.The confrontation was hilarious, to say the least. Supreme and a group of his supporters ambushed Cruz, who was standing outside his campaign bus. They swarmed Cruz, carrying handmade  Vermin Supreme 2016  signs. Shouting into a megaphone, Supreme asks Cruz: Ted Cruz, do you agree that the waterboarding water should be fluoridated? Shouldn t we at least fluoridate the water that we use to water board the bad people with? That s Supreme s act in a nutshell. He makes completely ridiculous comments about either real issues or fictional ones. Supreme rose to fame instantly when a video was published online that showed him campaigning on the promise that if he is elected, everyone will get a free pony.Obviously not knowing what the heck is going on, Cruz flees to the safety of his campaign bus. Once inside Supreme shouts into the megaphone towards the bus: Surrender, Ted Cruz, surrender. We have you surrounded. You must surrender immediately. Put your hands in the air and drop your pants for your safety, thank you. Mr. Cruz, why do you hate America? Sir, why do you hate America? Taking shots at both Cruz s religious zealotry and his hawkish foreign policy platform, Supreme concludes the protest/campaign event/performance piece by holding a prayer. Supreme prays that: That, uh, we don t get into any wars, and the war that we do get into against Narnia, that there will not be very many American causalities.

        "text": "In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Mitt Romney discussed the fact that Donald Trump has vowed that he won t release his tax returns before the election. Romney insists that Trump must have a  bombshell  in his tax returns and that they might reveal something really nefarious and  disqualifying. This statement was in response to the bombshell Trump dropped on voters on Wednesday, in which he said he wouldn t release them. Trump has previously said that he would release his tax returns once the IRS is done auditing them. This claim is bizarre on its face. Here s Trump during a debate talking about the alleged audit:Tax experts are dubious:An audit by itself would not prevent Trump from releasing his tax returns, said David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer prize winning tax author. It is up to an individual whether to disclose his or her tax return to the public, a lender or anyone else who wants to see it.Audits are rare. Overall, fewer than 1% of all individual returns are audited, although the rate is closer to 10% for tax filers with incomes over $10 million. The IRS says it expects to conduct 1.2 million individual audits this year, the lowest level in 11 years.Source: CNN MoneyThe IRS agrees: Federal privacy rules prohibit the IRS from discussing individual tax matters. Nothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information,  the IRS said in a statement released to NBC News.Source: NBC News Originally, the speculation was that Trump s tax returns would show that he s worth far less than his claim of $10 billion (or whatever he s saying today), but apparently Romney feels that it could be something much, much worse, and that Trump might have ties to the mob. Of course, that s not a huge leap to make, especially since Trump is in the construction business and in the casino business. Both industries are known for mob connections. That doesn t mean he has the mob connections, or more importantly, that he benefits from the mob connections, but it s not surprising that Romney could draw that conclusion.The irony, though, is that the tables have done a complete 180 from 2012 to now. Four years ago, Romney hadn t yet released his tax returns and it was Trump calling for transparency. Here s Romney being asked about his tax returns:Trump did eventually endorse the multi-millionaire, but not after saying this about Romney s tax returns:I think Mitt was hurt really very badly by this whole thing with the income tax returns. I believe he should have given them April 1, but I didn t think going into a little bit of detail without going into a lot of detail was positive thing. He ll come back. He has proven to be very resilient guy. He has been hurt a number of times by number of different things, he comes back. He really seems to be very tough and resilient. You have to hand it to him.Source: Fox NewsIt s somewhat surprising that Trump won t release his tax returns. He has famously said that he could shoot someone from the middle of Fifth Avenue and his followers would still love him. Sadly, that s probably true. A few billion less on his tax return can t make a difference, right? It s doubtful that even mob connections could damage him politically. Even white supremacist connections make his followers say  meh.  It could be that Trump s tax returns have something much worse, for him. They could point to illegal activity. This could be mob related, or it could be something else.Featured image via Ethan Miller/ Getty Images.",

        "title": "DETECTIVE ON SETH RICH Murder Mystery Drops Shocking News [Video]",
        "text": "Rod Wheeler was on Hannity last night with startling information on the Seth Rich murder mystery. He spoke about the mystery of why they can t locate the computer Rich used. They went on to discuss clues in the case that point to collusion between the DC police and the DNC. The most shocking information comes at the 4:20 mark when Wheeler says this:Rod Wheeler:  Here s one other thing that is going to be startling I m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC check this out a high ranking official at the DNC when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around? The plot thickens in this case. Will we finally find the murderer of this young man and who is behind it?IN CASE YOU HAVEN T SEEN UPDATES ON THIS CASE:CONFIRMED BOMBSHELL: SETH RICH Sent Over 44,000 DNC Emails To Journalist, Best Friend Of Wikileaks Founder DC Police Officer Claims They Were Told To  Stand Down  On Case [VIDEO]Wow! The private investigator hired by the Rich family to look into the death of 27-year old murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich just revealed some stunning evidence. It s been confirmed that over 44,000 emails and over 17,000 attachments were sent to the now deceased investigative journalist and best friend of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Now that this new information has been made available to the public, will the media be asking Hillary or the DNC any questions about their involvement in Rich s death? Will the DOJ be opening an investigation into his death in light of this new stunning evidence? What about the alleged Russian hack of the DNC emails that the media tried to tie to President Trump?Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich s death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation. The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,  said Wheeler.  They haven t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both. When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said,  Absolutely. Yeah. That s confirmed. Wheeler also told us,  I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said,  Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can t share any information with you.  Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don t think it comes from the chief s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, law enforcement sources told Fox News.A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of DNC staffer Seth Rich s computer generated within 96 hours after his murder, said Rich made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.  FOX5DCHere is the tweet announcing the death of Gavin MacFayden only weeks before the U.S. presidential election:Gavin Macfadyen was mentor to Assange (and his closest friend in London), to WikiLeaks' Sarah Harrison, Joseph Farrell and many others.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 23, 2016 I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.The revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor and whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich s family to probe the case. Rich was shot from behind in the wee hours, but was not robbed. My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  Wheeler said.  I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters. The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.   FOX NewsWe reported on this story extensively. Here are some of our stunning findings over the past 10 months. It s pretty stunning that it took so long to find out about the e-mails on Rich s laptop: Conspiracy theories have been surrounding the murder of Seth Rich. They reached a new frenzy after the hacking of DNC e-mails led to the resignation of its chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.Rich was beaten, shot and killed early on the morning of July 8 while he was walking home and talking on the phone to his girlfriend. Police have said they haven t determined if his murder was a botched robbery or something else. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone.Wikileaks just confirmed murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leak.Wikileaks released a series direct messages from US alleged  Russian spy  Guccifer 2.0 to actress model Robbin Young (according to Young).In the stream of texts the discussion leads to the DNC leaker.His name is  Seth ** In November Julian Assange said Russia did not hack into the DNC servers. -h/t GP Here s the proof:Direct Messages from U.S. alleged Russian spy @GUCCIFER_2 to actress-model @robbin_young (according to the latter) https://t.co/uMsB9WgxRQ  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 8, 2017Actress Robbin Young claims she had given this information she received from Guccifer 2.0 to the authorities but,  no one cared :https://twitter.com/Robbin_Young/status/850743524953702404Actress Robbin Young states that Guccifer 2.0 told her,  i m eager to find facts about seth, i m sure it wasn t just a robbery. seth was assassinated. :Guccifer 2.0 said, \"i'm eager to find fact about seth, i'm sure it wasn't just a robbery. seth was assassinated.\" #SethRich  Robbin Young (@Robbin_Young) March 29, 2017In June 2016,the hacker Guccifer 2.0 claimed responsibility for breaking into the Democratic National Committee s servers, lifting opposition research the DNC had gathered, including a 200-page document focused on presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.The hacker s moniker is an homage to  Guccifer,  the nom de guerre of Romanian hacker Marcel Lazar who claimed a previous hack into Hillary Clinton s private email server and is now awaiting prosecution for cybercrimes.  RTWhile Wikileaks  Julian Assange was being interviewed by John Pilger, he brought up the death of Seth Rich. Watch Assange s strange and somewhat cagey reply.Here is part of the conversation:Julian Assange: Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks. As a 27 year-old, works for the DNC, was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.Reporter: That was just a robbery, I believe. Wasn t it?Julian Assange: No. There s no finding. So  I m suggesting that our sources take risks.Watch it again in slow motion below:Seth Rich s parents explain what happened only moments before his death. He was the Voter Expansion Data Director for the DNC. His parents say he was,  Making sure everyone who wanted to vote, had the opportunity :Shortly after the killing, Redditors and social media users were pursuing a  lead  saying that Rich was en route to the FBI that fateful morning, apparently intending to speak to special agents about an  ongoing court case  possibly involving the Clinton family.More recently, Wikileaks s thousands of DNC emails and voice mails have piqued Reddit s interest, with Redditors combing through years of communications looking for any clue to Rich s murder.The theory is apparently based on Julian Assange s recent ITV appearance, where he scoffed at the idea that Russian hackers could be responsible for the data dump, and said that  anyone  within the Democrats  organization could easily have sent Wikileaks the offending messages.Given that Rich as a DNC staffer presumably would have had some access to its servers, Reddit is absolutely positive Rich paid the ultimate price for exposing Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC s crusade against Bernie Sanders.

        "text": "Award-winning actress and political activist Susan Sarandon has been busy speaking praises for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. After expressing her support for the Vermont senator at an Iowa campaign rally, Sarandon sat down with online network The Young Turks and told them what really frightened her about this election: Republican front runner Donald Trump.Noting that Trump has made the Republican party look like an absolute circus, Sarandon said she believed that there were some  sane Republicans  that would never even dream of nominating Trump, who is pretty much  like a figure from a Kurt Vonnegut novel. I cannot believe for a second that America would actually make Donald Trump the president. Republicans are not all bad, they re not all crazy, they re not all greedy. I think there s some very sane Republicans and they must be so embarrassed by what s going on right now. However, she is terrified of the amount of support the GOP candidate has gotten, and thinks he could be incredibly dangerous for America s future. She said: He reminds me of, like, your drunk uncle at a wedding who gets up and starts talking and just loves the crowd and just goes on and on and on and says whatever he can to get a reaction. The Oscar winner revealed that what really bothered her the most about Trump s rhetoric   the way he views minorities. She explained: What concerns me is that he has made hatred and racism normal   he s normalized it. He s taking this, you know, [THE]undercurrent of discontent that s looking to blame somebody and he s legitimized those feelings and that, I think, is a very dangerous thing. You can watch Sarandon s entire takedown of the racist front runner below:Sarandon has weighed in on Trump before, stating that she thought he appealed to Americans who were  really starved for something authentic  despite the fact that  he has no idea specifically what he s talking about.  She also said, I think it s great that the Republicans have to figure out how to deal with him, it s interesting. Meanwhile, Sarandon is trying to focus on supporting Sanders. She explained: For me, gender is not what s important. Issues are what s important. I want a candidate who has the courage to stand and do the right thing when it is not popular.

        "text": "Megyn Kelly is quite possibly the least popular host on television. She s also quite possibly one of the highest paid hosts on one of the lowest rated morning shows on television. In her desperate attempt to do just about anything for ratings, the very unlikeable host went after Fox News and the former top-rated host Bill O Reilly. Was Kelly s on-air letter an attempt to jump on Hollywood s anti-sexual harassment bandwagon? Was she hoping to endear herself to a more left-leaning audience, since she clearly has no hope of ever regaining the conservative fans she lost when she attacked then-candidate Trump during a FOX News hosted GOP primary presidential debate? The NBC News host made the reveal before welcoming former Fox News host and O Reilly accuser Juliet Huddy onto her Monday talk show.Former Fox News host Juliet Huddy spoke out for the first time about her accusations against Bill O Reilly and what women face when going up against a corporation on Monday s Megyn Kelly Today.During an opening segment about this weekend s report of new sexual harassment revelations against O Reilly, former Fox News host Kelly revealed that she, too, had complained about O Reilly s behavior. She said she understands the roadblocks women see when speaking out about sexual harassment, something an emotional Huddy explained as  You are just this one person about to go up against a machine. It s daunting and frightening and it holds you back from taking action sometimes. Earlier this year, the New York Times reported that Huddy said O Reilly pursued a sexual relationship with her in 2011 and that when she rebuffed his advances he tried to derail her career. Allegations included O Reilly calling Huddy repeatedly, sometimes sounding as if he were masturbating, and after asking her to return a key to his hotel room, he appeared at the door in his boxer shorts. In exchange for her agreement not to sue, she was paid a sum in the high six figures, though 21st Century Fox and O Reilly said her allegations were false.To open the show, Kelly made public for the first time a letter (below) she wrote to the co-presidents of Fox News about O Reilly, displaying the note she sent to Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy during the top of her show while discussing this weekend s Times report about a new sexual harassment settlement made by O Reilly. Fox News was not exactly a friendly environment for harassment victims who wanted to report, in my experience,  Kelly said.  However, O Reilly s suggestion that no one ever complained about his behavior is false. I know because I complained. Not so fast Megyn Bill O Reilly immediately revealed 2 handwritten letters from Megyn Kelly where she gushed all over him and how much she appreciated him on his website:My former FNC colleagues Megyn Kelly & Gretchen Carlson wrote me notes when we worked together. You can read them on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C  Bill O'Reilly (@BillOReilly) October 23, 2017Here are Kelly s letters to O Reilly: O Reilly even took it a step further and released a letter from sexual harassment accuser and former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson:Here is Carlson s letter to O Reilly:Bill  Thank you for being the calm in the sea.Thank you so much for supporting me.Thank you for being my friend.It means the world to meGC[Gretchen Carlson]Megyn immediately got hammered on Twitter after O Reilly released her letters to him. This tweet is from NYC radio talk show host Mark Simone:Yet Megyn Kelly forgets to mention that NBC covered up the Harvey Weinstein story for a year. Must have had another hard break.

        "text": "Vice President Joe Biden has nothing but glowing praise for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Biden, who contemplated a run for the presidency but decided to opt out, said of Sanders: Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real. And he has credibility on it. And that is the absolute enormous concentration of wealth of a small group of people, with a middle class now being left out. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkFFh2M8rAc]Biden was referring to Sanders  consistent record of speaking out on and pushing initiatives about income inequality throughout his  career. Sanders has made the issue a central theme of his campaign. Biden also believes the issue of income inequality is of vital importance to the country. He said: There used to be a basic bargain. If you contributed to the profitability of an enterprise, you share in that profit, and that s been broken. Productivity is up and wages are stagnant. Sanders  strength is with young voters, with polls showing that he leads in double digits in that demographic. Many millennials, for example, have enormous college debt and they continue to have a tough time in the job market. Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, an organization that encourages young people to get involved in politics, said:  Part of it is really sort of the age that they grew up in. If you think about the millennials, that age group, they turned 18 as President George W Bush took office. That s the world they grew up in: their country is at war, it seemed to have lost purpose. And then as they were graduating from college the recession hit. So the social contrast that people generally have   that you invest in your education and you get paid off   was a myth for them. One thing is his genuineness. He s been consistent warrior against economic inequality since the 60s, and he hasn t changed a bit. Although Biden has not officially made an endorsement, he did meet with Sanders last October to discuss campaign finance reform.Bernie Sanders  campaign is moving in the right direction, gaining momentum at the right time more than any other candidate despite the fact that the media has not paid attention to him.  If the current polls are indicative of things to come, the Republicans better look out. Polls show him trouncing all Republican candidates, including Donald Trump by a wide margin.Featured Image: Marc Nozell (flickr)",

We will call it  radical Islamic terrorism. We will target the ideology, and we will call them out for being evil,  Gorka stated. MSNBC s Ali Velshi and Stephanie Ruhle then tried to criticize Gorka s use of the phrase.Velshi asked Gorka how it would help stop terror attacks if the White House called the problem  radical Islamic terrorism. Gorka then engaged a clever metaphor to help them understand. Gorka argued,  If you, God forbid, caught cancer, and the hospital was forbidden from calling it cancer and said,  You have the flu. Go home and hydrate and take some aspirins, would you actually have the right treatment?.' Ruhle responded, smugly, that there s still no cure for cancer and that it doesn t matter what you call it if it will still kill you.Velshi then accused Gorka of not having a good answer. Gorka fired back by saying that if you misdiagnose anything, whether it s a serious disease or a serious international geopolitical threat, you will never solve it. The White House Adviser then criticized the Obama administration for blaming this geopolitical issue on economic conditions and societal disenfranchisement It is about people having an ideology that is evil, and it has to be destroyed.

He kills two birds with one stone when he boasts about his  landslide  win, which is technically a loss when you consider that Hillary Clinton beat him by millions of votes.Despite how much Trump feels he deserves the presidency, many Americans disagree   and we re seeing direct proof of this resistance as Trump is finding it impossible to get people to perform at his inauguration in January. With only a few weeks to go and no A-list entertainers up for the task, Trump had hoped he could turn to his longtime pal, opera singer Andrea Bocelli. It was reported: Trump has a long-standing relationship with Bocelli, and wants to ask him in person to perform. The plan is to have acts at the inauguration that are meaningful for Trump, and he s a huge fan of Bocelli. But unfortunately for Trump, this too is falling apart. Despite being friends with Trump for years, Bocelli has chosen to bail on him due to the intense backlash the singer faced on social media. Some threatened to  Boycott Bocelli , while other fans warned him, You will lose millions of fans.  According to another close source: Bocelli said there was no way he d take the gig . . . he was  getting too much heat  and he said no. As time runs out, so are Trump s options. He s already faced multiple rejections from artists such as John Legend, Adam Lambert, and Elton John. Trump became so desperate that he started to offer U.S. ambassadorships to talent agents if they could find him someone to perform, but that hasn t worked either.But Trump still has one more option. Considering that Trump ditched a critical press conference to have a meeting with artist Kanye West last week, perhaps Trump might consider asking him. It would only make sense to have an artist just as egotistical and narcissistic as Trump perform at his inauguration.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",

Will FOX News survive if their one-time loyal viewers turn their backs on their two biggest prime-time personalities? Fox News host Bill O Reilly has lost custody of his two teenage children after they reportedly said they would prefer to live with their mother following an alleged domestic violence incident, according to court documents.As reported by Gawker, Mr O Reilly s two children, 13 and 17, will live full time with his ex-wife Maureen McPhilmy.The decision taken by a Nassau County Supreme Court justice last year that the children should live with their mother was appealed by the news host to delay its enforcement.According to the 1,400 word opinion issued on 24 February, the court s four justices unanimously ruled in his ex-wife s favour based upon  the clearly stated preferences of the children  and the  quality of the home environment provided by the mother .Mr O Reilly s 17-year-old daughter told a court-appointed forensic examiner last year that she saw her father dragging her mother down a staircase by the neck.He responded to Politico in May last year:  All allegations against me in these circumstances are 100% false. I am going to respect the court-mandated confidentiality put in place to protect my children and will not comment any further.

In fact, ABC s  case study  of the 2010 Haiti-relief feeding frenzy may be the most damning foundation scoop yet.And the foundation isn t even denying it.ABC News got the emails via a Freedom of Information lawsuit. They show that, after the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake, a top Hillary aide repeatedly gave special attention to  Friends of Bill  looking to cash in.Indeed, the aide, Caitlin Klevorick, kept asking foundation official Amitabh Desai  to flag when people are friends of WJC    William Jefferson Clinton. Anyone without a special tag (FOB, WJC-VIP) got rebuffed by State and referred to a federal website.State was besieged with requests to get in on $10 billion in aid contracts, described in one government cable as  a gold rush. One FOB, a major foundation donor who d served as Bill s Texas chair, used his pull on behalf of a firm he admitted  wanted to get some of the business  and had him use the Clinton Foundation as  a facilitator. Klevorick told ABC the special attention was about learning who had a history in Haiti so as  to get the necessary resources to the right places as soon as possible to save lives. One problem: She never asked if anyone had experience in Haiti or even with aid relief. Her only question:  Is this a FOB?  And her only instruction to the foundation was that all FOBs be  flagged. Which is why the Haiti analyst for the nonpartisan Center for Economic and Policy says,  The line was pretty faint between  the foundation and the State Department.Even if the Clintons follow through on their vow to put  disinterested  third parties in charge at the foundation, this is a warning of how a Clinton White House would work   because political favoritism and corruption are just how Bill and Hillary roll.Via: NYP",

        "text": "We love this guy! Trey Gowdy gets it and gives a lesson to a DHS thug on due process! Yes! For progressives, the problem isn t Islam; it is the Constitution. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV)   who was elected as a supposedly pro-gun moderate   is remarkably frank:Appearing on Morning Joe to discuss the gun control measures Democratic senators filibustered for 15 hours to advance, Senator Manchin said,  Due process is what s killing us right now. Due process is killing us. If only we lived in a dictatorship with no limit on government power, everything would be fine (never mind that the FBI dropped the ball on the Omar Mateen case). At least it would be fine for Joe Manchin.Manchin gibbered incoherently that Mateen was on a terrorist watch list. Not at the time of the massacre he wasn t. The FBI investigated him twice due to all the red flags he was waving, but he was effectively cleared.A gun shop warned the FBI about Mateen prior to Orlando. But the agency didn t listen (now it has no comment).But if we just sacrifice our most basic liberties, boobs like Manchin will somehow keep us safe.It isn t just the Second Amendment that our progressive rulers want to use Islamic terror attacks as a pretext to destroy. They aren t fond of the Fifth or Fourteenth either. Both have due process clauses. As even liberal Slate recognizes,If the government can revoke your right to access firearms simply because it has decided to place you on a secret, notoriously inaccurate list, it could presumably restrict your other rights in a similar manner. You could be forbidden from advocating for causes you believe in, or associating with like-minded activists; your right against intrusive, unreasonable searches could be suspended. And you would have no recourse: The government could simply declare that, as a name on a covert list, you are owed no due process at all.That is, you have no rights at all.Discarding the Constitution isn t enough for Vox editor Emmett Rensin; he wants to abolish private property in the name of disarming law-abiding citizens: This presents a catch-22 for leftists. If they need to confiscate all of our property in order to take our guns, how will they prevent us from using guns to defend our property?Let s send progressives back to 2015 so that Trey Gowdy can give them a lesson in due process.",

        "text": "The Secret Service fired two uniformed division officers who were involved in the March 10th intrusion when Jonathan Tran jumped the White House fence and wandered the grounds for 16 minutes, even getting close to the White House s windows and doors:ALARM TURNED OFF: Shocking Details on WHITE HOUSE Fence Jumper:  It was even worse than I thought Secret Service personnel removed the alarm sensors along an area of fence line when the agency raised its height in response to previous fence-jumping incidents as a way to make it harder to scale. Ironically, the very effort to prevent fence jumping appears to have permitted a particularly egregious intrusion.One source said superiors in the Uniformed Division told Secret Service personnel to remove the sensors and piece them together for use elsewhere. They were never replaced.There are at least 10 to 12 officers and agents, including supervisors from the Presidential Protective Division, monitoring these sensors at any given time. They do so from the Joint Operations Command Center or JOCC, which is located outside of the White House complex.Some agents and officers also are questioning why Secret Service never released the K-9 unit to try to find an intruder after the alarms on the first fence the intruder scaled went off.Rep. Jason Chaffetz weighs in below on details of what the intruder did in those 17 minutes: The White House fence jumper who lingered on the ground unnoticed for 17 minutes was literally just hanging out in plain view with alarms blaring, and the Secret Service had no clue.Congressman Jason Chaffetz tells TMZ he met with the Director of Homeland Security and the Acting Director of the Secret Service for an hour and a half Tuesday, and his conclusion    It was even worse than I thought. Chaffetz says the surveillance video is shocking   the intruder was not darting around. Rather, he was  lingering,   hanging out  on the grounds. At one point he took the time to bend down and tie his shoes.The intruder at times peered through windows of the building, where Trump was inside. As we previously reported, he also jiggled a doorknob.Chaffetz says some of the alarms failed but some went off, yet the intruder was not detected.Secret Service agents did check the grounds, but not with any urgency. Alarms frequently go off for various reasons, and this time it was met with an inadequate response.And Chaffetz says the video shows agents were simply  lackadaisical.  As he put it,  Everything went wrong.  The congressman says he was promised there would be  big changes,  adding,  There better be. Via: tmz",

        "text": "21st Century Wire says With the ongoing hysteria constantly spouting from the American mainstream media about alleged  Russian meddling  in the 2016 election which saw Donald Trump elected as president of the United States, the world is still awaiting a single shred of real evidence to support the establishment s conspiracy theory. To date, none has surfaced. The intelligence community has said that this election was meddled with by the Russians in a way that frankly is not particularly original. They ve been doing this for an awfully long time, and we are decades into the Russians trying to undermine American democracy,  CIA chief Mike Pompeo told MSNBC s Hugh Hewitt in an exclusive interview that aired Saturday, June 24.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, has made a noteworthy response to Pompeo s comments.via Russia InsiderTranslation: We could not but take note of and comment on the June 24 statement by CIA Director Mike Pompeo during his NBC interview. The statement dealt with Russia s alleged long time attempts to undermine the American democracy and meddling in the US elections. It appears that in his opinion Russia s longtime attempts to undermine the US democracy have culminated in the interference in US elections. As we know the issue of Russia s meddling in the election process has become a favorite media story and an obsession in the United States. This story has been adopted by anti-Russia propagandists. This issue continues to pick up momentum and is mentioned in statements by officials who are trying to accuse Russia of engaging in unlawful actions but who have failed to produce any evidence to date.We would like to remind them about some outstanding pages of US history. Unlike the Americans, we have real facts at our disposal, and we know what we should focus on. It is common knowledge that since the early 1990s the United States had voiced its intentions to establish a Jeffersonian democracy in Russia. But the very fact of setting such a task completely runs counter to the ideas of Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the American nation and democracy. All of us know he called for respecting various forms of government, chosen by other nations and said the United States would not impose its will anywhere. He was mistaken. Thomas Jefferson referred to the idea of dictating the form of government to an independent country as arrogant, brutal and outrageous.It appears that the ideologists of the present-day America have very poor knowledge of their own history and the foundations of their statehood, if the concepts of  exporting democracy  and  humanitarian intervention  have become their favorite method for conducting an aggressive foreign policy as part of their national concept. For decades, dozens of countries all over the world have been suffering from US-imposed sate system formulas they are trying to equate all countries under one and the same pattern, without any consideration for what makes each of them unique. This policy and experiments cannot be called harmless. In the past few years Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Syria and Ukraine have fallen prey to this concept. Needless to say, al-Qaeda in all its manifestations, ISIS and other radical terrorist groups of all religious denominations evolved on the fertile soil created by the Americans and in fact often were the brainchildren of these forces.Generous financial injections in the form of projects and grants through numerous foundations and NGOs is another  grey zone  through which the United States has been trying to influence political processes all over the world for many years. Russia virtually tops the list of these allocations. Various government and non-government organizations, including the Peace Corps, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute and many other similar agencies, have been planting their agents for decades in order to penetrate the Russian political establishment and media community and to influence public opinion. According to some sources, the US has spent 5 Billion dollars for these purposes in the 1990s alone. It is very strange that, while making such statements, Mr. Pompeo forgets that many decisions stipulating the allocation of funding were approved by his own agency. It is strange that Washington forgets the fact that in the run-up to the 1996 Russian presidential election, the Federal Reserve bank delivered $500 million in cash to the US Embassy in Moscow under a far-fetched pretext of avoiding frenzied demand during the exchange of old $100 notes. Operatives from the CIA s Moscow Embassy station, headed by Michael Sulick, virtually slept on the money bags, while guarding them. Foreign-made cars delivered small batches of money from the Embassy to certain individuals.Who did the US sponsor using this money? I believe we will also learn this someday. I do not mean our assumptions, everything is clear here  Well will know the specific names, dates and so on. Here are only a few examples of diverse US activities aiming to undermine stability in various regions worldwide and in those areas that are not ready to follow American instructions. We are in no way demanding that Mr. Pompeo should stop his rhetoric because this is in the realm of fiction. One should simply understand that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. We are ready. READ MORE RUSSIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russia FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",

        "text": "It s not just people tied to alleged president Donald Trump s campaign and administration who are linked to Russia, it s also his eldest son. According to the Wall Street Journal, Donald Trump Jr. was likely paid at least $50,000 for an appearance late last year before a French think tank whose founder and wife are allies of the Russian government in efforts to end the war in Syria.On Oct. 11 at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, hosted by the Center of Political and Foreign Affairs, Trump s son addressed a dinner.We re not sure how a murderous thug like Vladimir Putin would be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize:Its president, Fabien Baussart, and his Syrian-born wife, Randa Kassis, have cooperated with Russia in its drive to end the Syrian civil war, according to U.S., European and Arab officials. In December, Mr. Baussart formally nominated Russian President Vladimir Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.Mrs. Kassis is a leader of a political faction endorsed by Russia in negotiations to end the war in Syria. The couple said they don t represent Russia and are solely focused on ending the Syrian conflict. Donald Trump Jr. has been participating in business-related speaking engagements for over a decade discussing a range of topics including sharing his entrepreneurial experiences and offering career specific advice,  the company s vice-president for marketing said.But it appears to be about more than sharing experiences.Mrs. Kassis heads a political party, the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, which is part of a faction endorsed by Russia in international negotiations aimed at ending the six-year Syrian conflict. She regularly visits Moscow to coordinate policy with Russia s Foreign Ministry, said Arab and European officials, and portrayed in Russian state media.In interviews, Mrs. Kassis said she stressed to Donald Trump Jr. in October the need for the U.S. and Russia to cooperate in ending the Syrian conflict. She said she passed on Mr. Trump s views to Russian diplomats in subsequent trips she s made to Moscow.Embattled Attorney General is the seventh person associated with Trump s campaign or administration with ties to Russia. Sessions lied under oath, saying that he had not spoken with Russian officials while working on Trump s campaign. Trump s son s financial connection to an entity associated with the Kremlin brings up even more questions.Donald Trump s financial debt to Russia, along with allegations that Russia is blackmailing him, and his pro-Russian political policies while praising Vladimir Putin, make the issue of releasing his taxes even more important now. American banks stopped lending the former reality show star money. Deutsche Bank, an entity who has loaned Donald a hell of a lot of money, was recently fined  502m over Russia money laundering claims.There s a reason so many Americans were concerned over Trump s massive amount of conflicts of interest. One of them being that he could be beholden to a hostile foreign entity such as Russia. But, Trump supporters wanted a man with zero political experience in office, some of them doing so in the belief that their candidate would create jobs. So far, Trump has created weekend vacations for himself, scandals and held thank you rallies. #MAGA!Photo by John Moore/Getty Images.",

        "text": "The poor little ISIS-inspired, chain migration, snowflake, terrorist can t even walk by a Christmas poster without being triggered. How long before Mayor DeBlasio starts the dialogue about removing triggering signs of Christmas from NYC, so as not to offend non-Christians? The taxi driver behind the failed terror attack in a New York City told investigators he meant to detonate his homemade pipe bomb in the busy subway station after seeing the walls festooned with Christmas posters   in revenge for violence against Muslims all over the world.While initial reports suggested the crude pipe bomb, made from a pipe, a 9-volt battery, match heads, sugar, Christmas tree lights and screws, had detonated prematurely, suspect Akayed Ullah, 27, insisted he set off the bomb deliberately.Ullah, who was arrested and taken for questioning after the bomb only partially detonated, told police he was walking through the underground tunnel at 7.20am, between the Port Authority station towards Times Square, when he saw the Christmas-themed posters on the wall, which reminded him of ISIS  calls last month for militants and lone wolves to attack holiday markets.  He acknowledges he purposely set it off then and there,  a senior law enforcement official told the New York Post.The Bangladeshi immigrant added that he was specifically inspired by ISIS,  not Al-Qaeda .Authorities say that if the explosive had fully detonated in the busy Midtown Manhattan subway station, there would have been more injuries and doubtless loss of life.The attack came days after Ullah s Brooklyn neighbors say they heard a huge row coming from his home, reporting yelling and screaming over the past two nights.Ullah, who was allowed to stop and pray multiple times during his interrogation, was taken to Bellevue Hospital to be treated for serious burns and lacerations to his abdomen and hands but is expected to survive. At the hospital, the Brooklyn resident told investigators that he was inspired to carry out the attack by the recent flare ups between Israelis and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.Monday s attack was the first terror attack on U.S. soil since that proclamation, but only one of many violent demonstrations across the world since the controversial move was announced last Wednesday. It was also the second time in two months that New York City was the target of a terrorist attack.President Trump said in a statement that  lax  immigration policies were to blame for the attack, and urged Congress to  enact legislative reforms to protect the American people .Authorities say Ullah took the A train subway to the Port Authority Bus Terminal stop Monday morning, and started walking east towards Times Square via an underground terminal when a pipe bomb hidden underneath his clothes prematurely exploded. Law enforcement officials don t believe the passageway was the intended target since the  low-tech  bomb   attached to Ullah with Velcro and zip ties   did not explode fully.The chemical explosive appears to have ignited but the pipe itself did not burst. Screws were found at the scene, indicating that they may have filled the pipe and were intended to be used as shrapnel.In the end, Ullah was the only one seriously injured by the explosive (three others reported to hospitals for ringing in the ears and headaches).

        "text": "There is arguably no other person in America who dislikes Obamacare more than Ted Cruz. He is the guy who quite literally shut down the government in order to make an inane point about it. But even for Cruz, his latest attempt to show America how much he doesn t like the Affordable Care Act is pretty pathetic.At a campaign rally, Cruz told the crowd that he and his family currently don t have any health insurance because  blah blah Obamacare. I ll tell you, you know who one of those millions of Americans is who s lost their health care because of Obamacare? That would be me,  Cruz told the audience at a campaign stop New Hampshire on Thursday evening.  I don t have health care right now. Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face. (I wouldn t advise taking that literally, Ted. The hospital bills will be through the roof.) Cruz seems to have intentionally torpedoed his family s chance to get insurance so that he could tell conservative voters that Obama cost him his healthcare.You may recall that Fox News spent months trying to dig up people who lost their health insurance because of the ACA. Cruz cited  millions.  In all their searching they found only a few. Those, it turned out, were mostly wrong about losing their health insurance. One by one they discovered that they either hadn t actually lost their insurance or their new plan was more affordable because of Obamacare. They were simply ignorant of what they were meant to do to get a new policy. Thanks, no doubt, to Fox News and its relentless misinformation.As Think Progress explains, Cruz is in a similar situation. He didn t  lose  his health coverage, he just didn t sign up for a new policy in time:Cruz s family used to be covered through a PPO plan with BlueCross BlueShield of Texas. But for 2016, the insurer decided to eliminate PPO plans and move to offering only HMO plans on the individual marketplace (which is becoming a bigger trend in the insurance industry). The insurance company announced this decision last July.The July announcement gave people enrolled in BlueCross BlueShield s plans a full five months to select a new HMO plan if they wanted to maintain coverage into the new year. Ted Cruz s family apparently just didn t sign up in time.Like the rest of America, Cruz was expected to pick his new plan before the new year. The marketplace actually extended their deadlines in order to make it easier for busy families to find time to sign up. Millions of Americans managed to do so. In fact, more Americans have health insurance today than at any other time in the country s history. Just not Ted Cruz and his family.After blaming Obama, Cruz hinted that his family aren t happy with him. He told the crowd: By the way, when you let your health insurance policy lapse, your wife gets really ticked at you,  Cruz said.  It s not a good   I ve had, shall we say, some intense conversations with Heidi on that. Note that even Cruz seems aware that he simply dropped the ball. He also admitted that he s currently signing up for insurance (which will begin in March.)At most, this is a mere inconvenience. For many American families, a lapse in insurance can be a scary time. One slip on the ice or nasty illness and one s savings can evaporate. That s unlikely to happen with Cruz. His wife, a former Goldman-Sachs executive, and Cruz, a senator, probably have enough money in the bank that any hospital bill can be taken care of even without insurance.While Cruz has consistently run on the idea that he will repeal Obamacare, Americans are growing to like it. Healthcare in the United States is still an absolute mess, and more reforms need to be done to fully address the problems, but more people on insurance means less bankruptcies, healthier workers, and longer lives. You can t put a number on more time with a loved one who may have been saved with access to healthcare, but you can put a number on what these life-changing opportunities are doing to the economy. Obamacare was framed by Republicans as a  job killer  and a deficit bomb   it s proven to be neither.So stop complaining and sign up for health insurance, Ted. Then go apologize to your family for gambling with their health to take a dig at the president. That s just bad form.Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",

        "title": " CNN Host STUNNED As Trump\u2019s Team REFUSES To Comment On Russian Hacking (VIDEO)",
        "text": "Donald Trump s team certainly doesn t make it easy for the people who have to interview them. In a typical interview with Trump s team, news anchors have to constantly fact check and repeatedly bring Trump s minions back to the original questions and topics as they deflect blame and avoid answering every question.On Monday s  New Day,  CNN host Alisyn Camerota had to interview Trump spokesman Sean Spicer, and it was basically an interview from hell as Spicer wouldn t give her any responses to the most pressing questions. Camerota had tried to ask Spicer just what special information Trump claimed he knows about Russia s involvement in the US election. Spicer s response couldn t have been more insane as he said Trump gets a lot of  classified information, intelligence reports  on a daily basis (despite the fact that Trump s team once said the president-elect only gets briefings once per week). Spicer then went off topic and said Trump will wait to make conclusions about the hacking, ignoring the fact that Trump has defended Russia extensively from all blame.Camerota was unwilling to let Spicer avoid the question, and she said: I want to get back to my question. Is Mr. Trump, who said he s going to reveal something, he says he knows things. Spicer again refused to give a response, stating that Trump would talk about it himself right before blaming Obama for not talking about China s 2015 hacking. Camerota responded by fact-checking Spicer right then and there. She said: Sean, just to correct you, you say not a single statement was ever issued or made after the Chinese hacking. I have the statement right here in my hands. Spicer s response was pathetic, as he admitted to being wrong but still continued to blame Obama, accusing Obama of responding too late. Camerota tirelessly tried to bring Spicer back to her question: Sean, I m more interested in what Mr. Trump is going to do. We re not electing President Obama again. You are representing Mr. Trump. Camerota asked about Trump s plans, and Spicer couldn t provide her with anything. All he did was confess that Trump didn t have a final report. Spicer then stunned Camerota by admitting that he had lied earlier when he said Trump had been briefed: The report is not final. He s not been briefed by the heads of the intelligence community. A stunned Camerota said in disbelief,  He has not been briefed about the heads of the intelligence community about whether or not they believe Russia is behind the hacking? Spicer began to fall apart when Camerota told him to  hold on  after he accused anyone who believed  non-final  reports of being irresponsible. Spicer shouted, No! Not, hold on! The idea we re asking people and making assumptions on a report that s not final is unbelievable. The rest of the interview, Camerota was forced to constantly counter Spicer s moronic remarks. Spicer practically ended the interview by completely disrespecting Camerota for expecting that Trump and his team might at least be exploring the possibility that reports about the Russian hacking are correct. Spicer said condescendingly: I know it s frustrating for you that we re doing it in a logical way. No, we re going to get all the information, get briefed properly and make a decision. We re not going to put the cart before the horse. Camerota couldn t believe her ears. You can watch this disastrous interview below:Featured image via screenshot",

He said when they did, others in the class called them names.

The teacher even told students that she would never stand for the Pledge of Allegiance and that if she did stand she would not really mean it.A spokesperson for Spalding School District tells CBS46 the assignment was supposed to be a lesson on First Amendment Rights, but they wouldn t say if the teacher was disciplined for her comments.In a letter sent home to parents Wednesday, the teacher wrote the following: I apologize for expressing my views to my students. I recognize that while this was not a one-sided lesson, the topic itself and the expression of my views were not appropriate, my intentions were well-meaning.Parents say they plan to stand with their children Thursday morning in front of the school s flagpole when the National Anthem is recited over the loudspeaker.

        "text": "House Democrats did something extraordinary today: they broke parliamentary procedure on the House floor and literally shamed Republicans after they blocked an important LGBT amendment from passing.Now this should come as no surprise. Republicans have always been hostile towards LGBT rights, and Democrats have been fighting them on the issue for decades. So what changed this time?Well, for starters, the amendment originally was slated to pass, with 218 members voting YEA, with more than 30 Republicans crossing the aisle to join every Democrat. The bill would have barred federal contractors from obtaining government work if they were found to discriminate against anyone in the LGBT community. This is something that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support for years.And it looked as though it was going to pass, and the issue could be a thing of the past.But then the TV voting monitor posted on C-SPAN showed that some of the votes from the Republicans were rescinded. The amendment narrowly failed 212-213. Republicans successfully convinced some of their colleagues to take the pandering cowards  way out and turn their backs on those in the LGBT community, thus giving the green light for federal discrimination.Democrats, rightfully so, didn t like that. After thunderous boos from every Democratic member, they decided to publicly shame the Republican cowards by literally chanting  shame  while pointing their fingers at them from across the aisle.When the chair said  There will be order,  Democratic Rep. Gwen Moore shouted back,  No there will not be. Democrats then set out a witch hunt to figure out who changed their votes. They were:Their offices haven t commented, so there is no telling as to why they changed their vote, who convinced them, and their reasoning for doing so. But if keeping to their history of being bigots, that s all the reason they need   to be bigots.Watch House Democrats put Republicans in their place: Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",

Benghazi information was compromised by Ms. Mills but it would be asking too much to expect her to come clean on it. Truth just isn t in the cards for any of these lowlifes.WASHINGTON When Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, her staff scrutinized politically sensitive documents requested under public-records law and sometimes blocked their release, according to people with direct knowledge of the activities.In one instance, her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, told State Department records specialists she wanted to see all documents requested on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, and later demanded that some be held back.In another case, Ms. Mills s staff negotiated with the records specialists over the release of documents about former President Bill Clinton s speaking engagements also holding some back.The records requests came under the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, the public s main tool to get information from the government. Decisions on what to release belong with each agency s FOIA staff, say experts on the law, to guard against the withholding of documents for political or other inappropriate reasons.Questions about the transparency of Mrs. Clinton s State Department tenure have been bubbling ever since it was revealed that she exclusively used a private email account to conduct her work as secretary. The existence of that private system, which is being investigated by a House special committee probing the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, meant the department didn t have access to her emails when public requests to see them came in.Read more: WSJ",

There s nothing been revealed to suggest the Obama administration surveilled the Trump campaign. That s not even what Nunes is saying. He s saying there s incidental collection outside of Russia.The problem he s created is he s gone out on a lark by himself, sort of an Inspector Clouseau investigation here, trying to find some unmasking information about collection incidental with the Trump campaign and some foreign agent outside of Russia. I think the only way this can be repaired is if he tells his colleagues on the House Intelligence committee who he met with and what he saw. Graham wants Nunes to do the right thing to fix this investigation, but believes that Nunes  objectivity is now in question. Graham also says that if he s not willing to share the information he has with his panel colleagues (Republican and Democratic), then he s  lost his ability to lead.

They re chopping, chopping, chopping, and we re worried about waterboarding. I just think it s   I think our priorities are mixed up. Trump insisted that he would only advocate torture that is permitted under the law in the United States. Then, like any good potential dictator, he said that laws regarding torture must be expanded.

A group of three Muslim men attacked strangers at the Liverpool city center because they were white  non-Muslims.  One witness feared the men were ISIS terrorists because they were using  racist language, talking about Muslims and Christians. A very similar occurrence took place in one of Minneapolis  more upscale neighborhoods last year when a mob of up to 30 young Somali men marched through the streets yelling disparaging comments and threatening homeowners:Somalis living in Minneapolis are almost all Sunni Muslims. Residents of the Lake Calhoun area say this wasn t the first time a group of Somali men have made an intimidating march through their neighborhood, which is filled with million-dollar homes.They first approached victim Gary Bohanna inquiring what religion he was affiliated with. When Bohanna answered I m a Christian,  the attacker shouted  Why aren t you a Muslim?  before punching him twice. The three men then approached Paul Lynch, Labour councillor for Moss Bank, and his girlfriend. One of the men punched Mr. Lynch with a  sickening blow  that could be  seen and heard.  He did not utter any racist comments, but the attackers laughed as the victim fell. Both men were taken to the hospital for their injuries.Witness Edris Nosrati called police but one of the men tried to flee, so the witness chased and caught him. The teenager struck Mr. Nosrati, but the hero held on. When questioned by police, one of the men claimed he was too intoxicated to remember anything. Another denied the assaults and suggested they had been racially abused by other men. However, he later confessed to  targeting people because they were white and non-Muslim. The Counter Terrorism Unit became involved in the investigation and the mens  family homes were turned upside down by the police. Amin Mohmed cried in court as he was jailed for 42 weeks.

There is no one who shamelessly sucks up to the former reality show star more than Sean Hannity. CNN s Jim Acosta has been questioning the blackout of the media at the White House lately. Most press briefings are now off-camera. Hannity, who works for the fake news network Fox News, responded by calling CNN  fake news.  He then called Acosta  arrogant,   combative  and  whiny.  According to Hannity, Acosta is  looking for ways to damage the President  as if Trump needs any help. CNN s White House darling is really starting to become unhinged,  Hannity said..@seanhannity Rips 'Unhinged' Jim @Acosta: 'He's Looking for Ways to Damage the President'https://t.co/BRq528lL9H  Fox News (@FoxNews) June 28, 2017Acosta responded on Wednesday by mocking Sean Hannity s attacks on him, tweeting that the Fox News host  needs a hug.

That would be great. ;)  Steve Mullis (@stevemullis) June 28, 2017Why is it that Sean Hannity can continuously come up with bogus stories and it's glossed over? CNN takes responsibility and it's a scandal?  Brendan Steakelum (@steakelum) June 28, 2017He doesn't deserve a hug, but a kick in the balls would be great?  CA Cramer (@CurtCramer1) June 28, 2017@seanhannity needs much more than a hug. Maybe start with a brain.  Greg Martin (@jgregorymartin) June 28, 2017That pathetic headline and tweet from the biased @FoxNews makes me love you even more Jim!!! Keep fighting the good fight!  Brian (@BrianSMcDonald) June 28, 2017Keep rocking Jim!!  Tanja (@bambula) June 28, 2017You're doing something right Jim if a loser like Hannity is talking about you!

American (@RealAmericanets) June 28, 2017You're my hero, @Acosta. I love this era where journalists give no fucks and the stoicism of the past dies. Give em hell. #hannityunhugged  Dena P (@Holdensmama) June 28, 2017We all remember Mustard-gate. Barack Obama just took office and the big story at Fox News was that he used mustard on his hamburger. That was a story the network covered for nearly a week. Sean Hannity seemed to suggest that Obama is an elitist for using mustard.coming from a man who was unhinged when President O asked for Dijon mustard.  Gerry (@geminiLAca) June 28, 2017Sean Hannity peddled the Seth Rich story AFTER his own company retracted it. CNN fired its employees for their mess up.  Chris (@yeschrisyes) June 28, 2017Jim-keep up the great work Fox/Hannity/Trump are showing just how much you are getting to them with your dogged, dedicated reporting-thx!!  Kati Angelini (@ktmoorestown) June 28, 2017??? Jim, you're the best!  Jennifer Newell (@WriterJen) June 28, 2017Jim, You're the best! Keep at it!  DianeW (@BellaLuna468) June 28, 2017It s odd that Hannity supports WikiLeaks, an entity who supposedly believes in the transparency of governments, yet the idea of a transparent Trump administration rattles him to the core. The Russia probe is not being reported accurately on Fox News and the network has begun losing its key demographics. Breitbart.com has fallen from 45th place to 281st place in news site traffic ratings as the right-wing site ignores Trump s massive scandals. Hannity, a conspiracy theorist, is using CNN to bash the press. Three journalists resigned and an inaccurate story was retracted. Meanwhile, Sean Hannity pushed the baseless Seth Rich murder conspiracy theory. That prompted advertisers to flee from his show. So, it s kind of cute that Hannity calls other outlets  fake news.

        "title": " Criminalizing Childhood: Tennessee Cops Arrest 6-Year-Olds For Not Breaking Up A Fight",
        "text": "When I was a kid, I watched a number of fights on the playground, in the school cafeteria and just on my block. This was true when I was in elementary school and it continued to be true all the way to when I was in high school. If you would have told me that I could be arrested for not breaking up the fight, I would have looked at you like you were certifiably insane.But that was before America decided that criminalizing childhood was a good idea:MURFREESBORO  More than 150 people called for action Sunday after parents said at least five students, ages 6 to 10, were handcuffed at Hobgood Elementary School on Friday.The students were arrested, accused of not stopping a fight that happened earlier off-campus and later released from the juvenile center on FridayThese were not kids that participated in the fight, they just watched it happen and were arrested for it. Think about that for a moment: a 6-year-old child was HANDCUFFED for not breaking up a fight. What did the police think this kid was going to do? Attack them? What kind of thought process leads a grown man to handcuff an elementary school student? Even worse, what kind of society ALLOWS a grown man to handcuff an elementary school student and not immediately fire them as a danger to the public?But back to the flawed premise behind the arrest. I happen to have a 6-year-old of my own and she has a fairly forceful personality, but the idea of her leaping into a fight to break it up is ludicrous. She s 6! And even if she d been 10, when did it become a legal obligation for kids to break up a fight they re not involved in? Don t the police have anything better to do with their time than turn little children into criminals?The icing on the cake was arresting them at the school in front of their classmates. Because leading a 6-year-old out of school in handcuffs can t possibly leave any long-term mental scars, right? Again, we as a society allow this to happen.This is the direct result of a fundamentally broken law enforcement culture. They no longer see communities as made up of people, they only see potential criminals. It seems that the thinking is, if you get them into the system when they re young, you ll have an easier time throwing them in jail later. Never mind that most of the cops involved almost certainly watched a fist fight as a kid, or got into one themselves, it s criminal behavior these days.Oh, and you ll be absolutely shocked to know that the community this occurred in is .you guessed it: Mostly African-American. Because when little Timmy watches a fight, it s just boys being boys. But little Leroy? He s a goddamn criminal and needs to be taught a lesson!With this kind of ongoing behavior, the police are hard at work creating an entire generation of (mostly minority) children that fear and loathe them. And then the cops have the gall to rage at the Black Lives Matter movement? Unbelievable.Featured image via Getty",

        "text": "In spite of Senator John McCain s promise to his constituents only 9 months ago when he was running for reelection, that he would fight to repeal and replace Obamacare, McCain voted late last night with two other liberal Republican senators, and every Democrat senator to keep Obamacare intact.But that s not what Senator McCain promised Arizona voters he would do only 9 months ago On October 10, 2016, John McCain faced off against his Democrat opponent Congresswoman Kirkpatrick in a televised debate. At the center of the debate was the disastrous Obamacare and what could be done to fix it. McCain responded: For the first time in history, a major entitlement reform was rammed through the Congress of the United States without a single vote from the other side. I fought for weeks, and weeks, and weeks against Obamacare and they would not allow us an amendment. There was not a single amendment allowed. No input from the minority party. We were the minority party. Now Congresswoman Kirkpatrick wants us to sit down and work together. Here s how we work together, we repeal and we replace it. McCain went on to argue that the majority of the American people have  resoundingly rejected Obamacare. One of the debate moderators asked McCain if it was possible for Congress to try to improve Obamacare rather than to try to repeal it. McCain rejected the idea that it could be fixed and that the only solution is to repeal Obamacare:  We have to scrap it entirely and start over.  McCain went on to explain why Congress MUST repeal Obamacare,  It s a scam and the problem is, that the cost is becoming prohibitive and we ve got to change it and fix it. Watch Senator John McCain as he arrogantly throws his thumb down in defiance of his own party and joins two of the most liberal Republicans in the Senate to thumb their noses at President Trump, as they jump across the aisle to join their friends who shut them out of the first Obamacare vote.",

        "title": " Kansas Republican Bill Would Give GOP Power To Impeach Judges Who Disagree With Them",
        "text": "If Kansas Republicans have their way, they will have the power to impeach state Supreme Court judges who disagree with the conservative agenda.A Kansas Senate committee has already recommended SB439 for passage so it can be voted on by the full Senate, which is controlled by conservatives.According to the Kansas City Star, the bill  would make  attempting to usurp the power  of the Legislature or the executive branch grounds for impeachment. In other words, if a judge rules a law passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature unconstitutional, Republicans would legally have the power to then impeach that judge and replace him or her with a judge who will rule the way Republicans want them to rule.Governor Sam Brownback and his Republican cohorts in the statehouse have had their schemes to defund public schools foiled by the state Supreme Court in recent years after the GOP tried to use the funds to pay for a disastrous budget shortfall created when Brownback gave rich people a massive tax cut.So far, the state Supreme Court has blocked such a move as unconstitutional since the Kansas Constitution plainly states that the  legislature shall provide for intellectual, educational, vocational and scientific improvement by establishing and maintaining public schools, educational institutions and related activities which may be organized and changed in such manner as may be provided by law. Furthermore, the Kansas Constitution says the  legislature shall make suitable provision for finance of the educational interests of the state. That means the Kansas Supreme Court has made the right call by denying Brownback and Republicans the ability to screw over the public school system to benefit the wealthy.But if Republicans pass this bill into law, they would be able to overthrow the judicial branch so they can pass whatever laws they want even if they are unconstitutional. They would be effectively rigging the court in their favor.And Kansas Republicans haven t exactly made this a secret.The Star reports:Impeachment has  been a little-used tool  to challenge judges who strike down new legislation, said Republican Sen. Dennis Pyle, a sponsor of the measure.  Maybe it needs to be oiled up a little bit or sharpened a little bit. Courts have the ability to harm society with their decisions,  GOP state Senator Mitch Holmes claimed in defense of the bill according to the Topeka Capitol Journal.  And impeachment was what our founders intended to be a check and a balance on an unchecked system, or what has evolved into an unchecked system. But once again, Republicans are wrong. Not only is their bill unconstitutional on the grounds that the state constitution does not list disagreement as a legitimate reason for impeachment, it would make the court system a puppet institution with the sole purpose of allowing Republicans to do whatever they want in the legislative and executive branches without a judicial branch that can check their power. Basically, it is the executive and legislative branches that would become an  unchecked system. Article 2 of the state constitution clearly states grounds for impeachment.The governor and all other officers under this constitution, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.So unless Republicans want to literally make disagreeing with them a crime, which would violate the First Amendment and the independence of the judiciary, they would be well-advised to trash this bill and never let it see the light of day again.This is the exact kind of government overreach that Republicans have hypocritically whined about for decades, and yet here they are trying to overthrow the state Supreme Court so that Brownback can stack it with judges who will do his bidding. Just imagine if this scheme actually worked. How long would it be before Republicans try the exact same thing at the federal level so that they can keep the court conservative forever? This is serious power play that needs to be squashed by the people of Kansas before they no longer have a fair court system to rely on. Featured image via LiberalBias.com",

        "text": "Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has clearly stated his leaks did not come from Russia. Watch:Former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray, who is a close associate of Julian Assange, said he has met the DNC leaker and he s not Russian. h/t GPI have watched incredulous as the CIA s blatant lie has grown and grown as a media story   blatant because the CIA has made no attempt whatsoever to substantiate it. There is no Russian involvement in the leaks of emails showing Clinton s corruption. Yes this rubbish has been the lead today in the Washington Post in the US and the Guardian here, and was the lead item on the BBC main news. I suspect it is leading the American broadcasts also.A little simple logic demolishes the CIA s claims. The CIA claim they  know the individuals  involved. Yet under Obama the USA has been absolutely ruthless in its persecution of whistleblowers, and its pursuit of foreign hackers through extradition. We are supposed to believe that in the most vital instance imaginable, an attempt by a foreign power to destabilize a US election, even though the CIA knows who the individuals are, nobody is going to be arrested or extradited, or (if in Russia) made subject to yet more banking and other restrictions against Russian individuals? Plainly it stinks. The anonymous source claims of  We know who it was, it was the Russians  are beneath contempt.As Julian Assange has made crystal clear, the leaks did not come from the Russians. As I have explained countless times, they are not hacks, they are insider leaks   there is a major difference between the two. And it should be said again and again, that if Hillary Clinton had not connived with the DNC to fix the primary schedule to disadvantage Bernie, if she had not received advance notice of live debate questions to use against Bernie, if she had not accepted massive donations to the Clinton foundation and family members in return for foreign policy influence, if she had not failed to distance herself from some very weird and troubling people, then none of this would have happened.It is terrible that the prime conduit for this paranoid nonsense is a once great newspaper, the Washington Post, which far from investigating executive power, now is a sounding board for totally evidence free anonymous source briefing of utter bullshit from the executive.In the UK, one single article sums up the total abnegation of all journalistic standards. The truly execrable Jonathan Freedland of the Guardian writes  Few credible sources doubt that Russia was behind the hacking of internal Democratic party emails, whose release by Julian Assange was timed to cause maximum pain to Hillary Clinton and pleasure for Trump.  Does he produce any evidence at all for this assertion? No, none whatsoever. What does a journalist mean by a  credible source ? Well, any journalist worth their salt in considering the credibility of a source will first consider access. Do they credibly have access to the information they claim to have?Now both Julian Assange and I have stated definitively the leak does not come from Russia. Do we credibly have access? Yes, very obviously. Very, very few people can be said to definitely have access to the source of the leak. The people saying it is not Russia are those who do have access. After access, you consider truthfulness. Do Julian Assange and I have a reputation for truthfulness? Well in 10 years not one of the tens of thousands of documents WikiLeaks has released has had its authenticity successfully challenged. As for me, I have a reputation for inconvenient truth telling.Contrast this to the  credible sources  Freedland relies on. What access do they have to the whistleblower? Zero. They have not the faintest idea who the whistleblower is. Otherwise they would have arrested them. What reputation do they have for truthfulness? It s the Clinton gang and the US government, for goodness sake.The worst thing about all this is that it is aimed at promoting further conflict with Russia. This puts everyone in danger for the sake of more profits for the arms and security industries   including of course bigger budgets for the CIA. As thankfully the four year agony of Aleppo comes swiftly to a close today, the Saudi and US armed and trained ISIS forces counter by moving to retake Palmyra.

        "text": "The notion that millennials are stupid, spoiled, uninformed voters who only care about themselves was shredded today after a new poll from the Harvard Institute of Politics showed millennial voters would overwhelmingly back Hillary Clinton in a general election matchup with Donald Trump.Collecting responses from over three thousand 18-29 year old voters showed Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton would garner 60 percent to Trump s 25 percent, an astonishing 36 point lead, while 14 percent remain undecided.So, in other words, the  selfish, uninformed, spoiled  millennials wouldn t back the actual selfish, spoiled, uninformed Republican front-runner. Go figure.Not only do millenials overall have a highly unfavorable view of Trump overall, he isn t all that popular amongst young Republicans, either. His bombastic, hateful nature has rubbed some young Republicans the wrong way:Overall, 60 percent of millennials want to see a Democrat occupy the White House in 2017, up five points from last year, while 40 percent want a Republican. It seems even Republicans aren t so keen on having a racist, sexist, bombastic blowhard being their commander-in-chief.

        "text": "If Republicans had hoped to escape 2016 without pulling a  Todd Akin  and costing themselves yet another election over idiotic abortion comments, they just lost it.In Missouri, a contentious fight over giving  personhood  rights to fetuses (and therefore legally defining abortion as murder), has given rise to one of the most horrific pro-life arguments made so far. Tila Hubrect, a state representative arguing in favor of  fetal personhood  claimed that abortion should be outlawed even in cases of rape because getting pregnant is the  silver lining  of the  bad  situation.Her comments were captured by Progress Missouri:It is not up to us to say  no, just because there was a rape, they cannot exist.  Sometimes bad things happen   horrible things   but sometimes God can give us a silver lining through the birth of a child.Many conservative pro-lifers think it, Hubrect just said it out loud: Women are baby factories and if they happen to get pregnant while being raped, then look on the bright side.The sickening conclusion is that women should be given absolutely no choice in who they conceive with.Missouri s Republicans are currently trying to make that conclusion fully realized with a particularly egregious pro-life bill that would define  personhood  at the moment of conception. This would allow fetuses to be given  due process  and possibly assigned state lawyers to file suits against their mothers if they tried to seek an abortion. Taken to its logical conclusion (which the Supreme Court would certainly take issue with), women could be held accountable for murder if they were to exercise their right to an abortion.Rep. Jay Barnes (R) recently bragged to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that this bill would make Missouri the most  pro-life state in the country  over night. He and people like Hubrect aren t messing around.Even in conservative Missouri, however, there seems to be limits to how far people are willing to let lawmakers control their bodies. Coincidentally or not, Missouri is also the home of former Rep. Todd Akin, who infamously floated the bogus theory that if there is a  legitimate rape  then the female body has ways to shut down her uterus and avoid a pregnancy. Akin went on to get positively demolished in his election to Democrat Claire McCaskill.It seems likely that Hubrect, perhaps overly giddy at the implications of this bill, may have just given her fellow Republican lawmakers a lot of heartache on Election Day.Listen to Hubrect s comments below:Featured image via LinkedIn",

        "title": " Did Mike Pence Use The Police To Illegally Suppress The Vote Of Tens Of Thousands Of Black People In Indiana?",
        "text": "Right in the middle of the nine thousand scandals swirling around Donald Trump comes one about his running mate, Mike Pence. As governor of Indiana, Pence oversaw everything from legalized discrimination to destroying the state s educational system, and there was even an attempt to destroy freedom of the press. Now, it s come out that he may have engaged in some voter suppression as well   particularly against Indiana s black voters.This is so much worse than the clearly fraudulent voter ID law. The Indiana State Police raided the offices of the Indiana Voter Registration Project (IVRP) in an alleged attempt to root out  voter fraud . IVRP didn t see it that way, and neither did advocacy groups. They saw it as a deliberate attempt to shut them down, slowing registration and nullifying thousands of registration applications for black people across the state. The whole  initiative,  if it can even be called that, started in nine counties, and then expanded to 56 counties shortly after this raid.The IVRP is based in Indianapolis, which has a higher black population than the rest of the state. Patriot Group USA, a progressive advocacy group, started running ads against Pence and the state after the raid. They and the IVRP say that more than 40,000 black Hoosiers may not be allowed to vote on Nov. 8.Besides that, employees were barred from filming the raid, and the police handcuffed a black employee and denied him his legal right to speak to an attorney.Black voters tend to vote Democratic, and almost every voter suppression tactics are aimed at harming Democratic voting. As longtime GOP consultant Carter Wrenn said, when he effectively threw his party and its suppression tactics to the wolves: Look, if African Americans voted overwhelmingly Republican, they would have kept early voting right where it was. He was speaking of North Carolina trying to end early voting, but this applies to most voter suppression tactics. Pence would know that   he s a conniving old white man who sees the black community as an electoral threat. If they can t register, they can t vote, and if they can t vote, his party is safer.It s so disgustingly simple it makes us want to put our fists through the walls.Of course, Pence s spokesperson called the allegations  false and absurd.  He said: In fact, the Indiana State Police has uncovered strong evidence of voter fraud by Patriot Majority USA. Among Governor Pence s top priorities is ensuring the integrity of the election and that every single Hoosier vote counts. He has full confidence in the Indiana State Police investigation to achieve this goal. Uh huh. Sure. The state police have found exactly ten irregularities so far, and they re mostly missing zip codes or other minor problems, according to Fusion. Ten, and those irregularities show anything but fraud.Pence ought to be ashamed of himself, but he s still Donald Trump s running mate so we all know he s incapable of shame.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",

        "text": "Make no mistake, the Muslim European invaders will not be satisfied until every woman in Europe is donning this head to ankle look on the beaches this summer. The radical Sharia Law adherents who have made the trek from some of the most radical Muslim countries in the world to the  accepting  shores of the EU are about to shake things up and it s going to be very ugly when that happens PARIS   Burkinis aren t showing up at the beaches on either side of the English Channel yet, but the thought that the full head-to-ankle swimsuit might catch on among Muslim women in Europe has already sparked lively debates in Britain and France.The modest Muslim beachwear, which looks like a loose-fitting wetsuit with a hoodie, has been around for about a decade. It has also been banned elsewhere, especially in public swimming pools in Europe and at some Moroccan beach resorts popular with foreign tourists.But most non-Muslims in Europe are only finding out about it now because the popular British department store chain Marks & Spencer has just launched its own burkini line in Europe to appeal to a growing niche market for  Islamic fashion,  combining modern design with Muslim principles of modesty.The arrival of burkinis in mainstream department stores has once again highlighted the differences between the pragmatic British approach toward multiculturalism and France s determined efforts to fend off any challenges to its official policies of secularism.There are about 2.7 million Muslims in Britain, or 4.5 percent of the population, and 5 million, or 8 percent of the population, in France.Marks & Spencer has stores across Europe, Asia and in the Middle East, where it has been selling burkinis for several years. Its online shop promotes two styles in English, French, German, Spanish and Dutch.House of Fraser, a rival British department store group, has come out with its own line. Both chains call the swimsuit burkini, a linguistic mashup of burka and bikini, but neither mentions religion in its advertising.In the  nation of shopkeepers,  as Napoleon is said to have called Britain, the burkini s defenders present it as a product that meets consumer demand.  We have sold this item for a number of years and it is popular with our customers internationally,  a Marks & Spencer spokeswoman said.The conservative tabloid Daily Mail called it  the ultimate proof Britain is truly multicultural  and noted that labels such as H&M, DKNY, Mango and Uniqlo had recently launched Muslim-themed fashion collections.Some critics decried the swimsuit as sexist; one asked why women had to  dress up like frogmen.  But others defended the right of Muslim women to choose.  If I want to buy a burkini from M&S, I bloody well will,  journalist Remona Aly wrote in an op-ed for the liberal Guardian newspaper.Across the channel in France, where the government worries about any sign that its Muslim minority is not fully adapting to the French way of life, the issue quickly escalated into political polemics that presented the burkini as the first step toward women s oppression and Muslim radicalism.Women s Rights Minister Laurence Rossignol said:  Sure, there are women who choose it, and there were American negroes who were for slavery.  She quickly apologized for using the word  negroes  but stood by her message.Advertisement (1 of 1): 0:09 Prominent feminist Elisabeth Badinter called for a boycott of shops that promote Islamic fashions. She said the French have forgotten their founding principle of equality for all, independent of faith, ethnicity or gender, and hesitate to criticize Muslims who stress their minority group status. We shouldn t be afraid of being called Islamophobes,  she argued. The French left has been too tolerant of Muslim communities that force their women to cover their hair and come up with novelties like the burkini, she said.Prime Minister Manuel Valls linked Muslim fashion to the strict Salafi movement, whose extreme fringe inspired the violent attacks in Paris last year, killing 147 people.At a conference on Monday, he said Muslim veils were not a fashion statement but  an enslavement of women  and declared that Salafism, which he described as a path to terrorism, might only represent 1 percent of French Muslims but was  winning the ideological and cultural battle  among them.Muslim community leaders complained that this tarred all Muslims with the terrorist brush, but their exasperated reactions got little coverage in the French media.Valls rarely speaks so bluntly about his concern that French society is being challenged by some of the country s Muslims who identify more as a discriminated religious minority than with the republic s universalist ideals of equality and secularism.Rooted in its 1789 revolution, these ideals have become France s civil religion, and they frame the stronger French reaction to Muslim issues from the more flexible treatment they get in Britain.The vigorous rejection of the burkini comes amid political tensions lingering from last year s bloody attacks.Only last week, President Fran ois Hollande had to abandon a tough law-and-order bill he and Valls suggested last November. The proposed law would have stripped French citizenship from terrorists who have a second passport, a small category of people who will be mostly Muslim immigrants.The conservative opposition and even important parts of his own Socialist Party rejected Hollande s plan.Air France touched this raw nerve recently when it advised stewardesses working on a newly reopened Paris-Tehran route that they would have to cover their hair and wear pants on arrival in Iran. Staff unions protested until the airline announced that only women who volunteer for the flights would be assigned to them. Via: St. Louis Today",

She noted that the handful of small spelling errors followed the phonetic sounds of words    pitcher  instead of  picture    which would be common in the writing of a young child. Then again, the letter also included a hyphen, which seemed sophisticated for a 9-year-old.Sheila Lowe, president of the American Handwriting Analysis Foundation, said she didn t see anything that would be inconsistent with a 9-year-old s writing, but she also clarified that she did not specialize in analyzing the writing of children.

        "text": "Last Thursday, during Hillary s acceptance speech at the DNC, she delivered a heart-wrenching and emotional tale about a little girl in a wheelchair. Boy, that Hillary she s always thinking of the less fortunate and doesn t think twice about sticking her neck out to help the little guy. There s only one problem with Hillary s story (and pretty much everything she says) it was all a big LIE! Hillary told the crowd at the DNC and millions more who were watching her on TV, about a poor suffering handicapped girl in a wheelchair in New Bedford, Massachusetts who could not go to school because of her disability. Hillary said she helped the girl get to school.Here s part of the transcript from the LA Times: My mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up on her own at 14, working as a housemaid. She was saved by the kindness of others.Her first-grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the entire year. The lesson she passed on to me, years later, stuck with me: No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up.And she made sure I learned the words from our Methodist faith:  Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can. So, I went to work for the Children s Defense Fund, going door-to-door in New Bedford, Mass., on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school.I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to go to school   it just didn t seem possible in those days. And I couldn t stop thinking of my mother and what she d gone through as a child.It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action.So we gathered facts. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. WATCH HILLARY SPIN HER BIG LIE HERE:Ken Pittman at WBSM reported:Here s what I learned; The Mayor of New Bedford in 1973 was a guy I happen to know, Mayor John Markey (81 years old and a lifelong Democrat now living in Dartmouth, MA. Mayor Markey is also a retired judge and a man whose credibility and character are beyond reproach.  Jack  as he is known, is eligible for both court and municipal pension but only accepts one. He is not one to  double dip . I called Jack and asked him a few questions about handicap services in 1973 at the New Bedford Public Schools, including wheelchair accessibility. I took over as Mayor in January of 1973. We had a budget for vans with drivers and provided services to students with disabilities. It was Tremblay Bus. They would pick them up and drop them off at their homes. Now, they may not have been able to go to the local school, depending on whether or not the schools were accessible for wheelchairs but there were many schools then which could and did accommodate our handicapped students in wheelchairs . In fact, we had a local guy who was a paraplegic, injured in a diving accident who came to my office many times to advocate for the disabled and I actually spent an entire day in 1973 in a wheelchair to better understand the challenges they face everyday. Soon after that we were cutting out sidewalks for wheelchairs and doing things in New Bedford before the laws ever compelled us to. Via: Gateway Pundit",

        "text": "Way to go Granny! Perfect timing for your announcement with the discovery of the Planned Parenthood s aborted baby parts business in the headlines Yesterday, Hilary Clinton defending late-term abortion on Twitter and called Wisconsin s abortion ban dangerous and unacceptable.As LifeNews previously reported, on July 19th, pro-life Governor Scott Walker signed the Pain Capable Unborn Protection Act, making Wisconsin the 15th state to ban abortions after 20-weeks of pregnancy. Prior to signing the bill, he said,  At five months an unborn child can feel pain. As a society we should be protecting that child. But Hillary Clinton has a vastly different view:Gov. Walker signed dangerous abortion restrictions into law in WI   without exceptions for rape or incest. Extreme and unacceptable. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 21, 2015 Governor Walker responded with his own rejoinder calling Clinton out of touch:  Hillary shows she s out of touch with the majority of Americans who believe babies at 5 months deserve life. -SW https://t.co/5NG0llQRbd  Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) July 21, 2015 Unfortunately, if Hillary Clinton becomes our next president she will further abortion-on-demand in America even though she once said she believes abortion should be rare. Bill Donohue from the Catholic League responded to her remarks and highlighted her radical abortion agenda.He said,  We know that Hillary lied when she said she wants abortions to be rare. To be exact, she opposed the ban on partial-birth abortions: if she is okay with killing a baby who is 80 percent born, there are no instances left for her to register an objection. Now we know that Hillary lied when she said she wants to keep abortions safe. As soon as Walker signed the law protecting unborn babies from feeling pain, Hillary labeled his decision  dangerous. He added that Hillary should explain what she means when she says that this ban is dangerous, considering the fact that some of these babies feel immense pain while being dismembered. Donohue concluded,  Hillary needs to elaborate on this. Why is it not uncomfortable forget about dangerous for a sensate human being to be pierced with a surgical knife? Why, for example, do these babies put their fingers up to the knife in an attempt to shield them from more pain? The public has a right to know what s going on in her mind. In May, Clinton joined President Obama in opposing the federal 20-week ban and said the following through a spokesperson:  Politicians should not interfere with personal medical decisions, which should be left to a woman, her family and her faith, in consultation with her doctor or health care provider. She added,  This bill is a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, which has protected a woman s constitutional right to privacy for over forty years. The bill puts women s health and rights at risk, undermines the role doctors play in health care decisions, burdens survivors of sexual assault, and is not based on sound science. However, the science behind fetal pain is solid, which is why so many states in the U.S. have worked to end late abortion. Unborn children have the biological equipment necessary to feel pain no later than 20 weeks after fertilization, and nerves link receptors to the brain s thalamus and sub-cortical plate around that same time. Researchers also found that unborn children react to pain by recoiling, which is the same way adult humans react to pain. In fact, during surgery on these little humans, fetal surgeons found that anesthesia was necessary to decrease their reaction to stress hormones.Via: LifeNews",

Now known as Abdul-Haqq, he decided the sport s lifestyle was incompatible with his hardline practice of the religion and took up preaching instead.An associate of the infamous Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and his banned organization Al-Muhajiroun, Haqq used social media to share his fundamentalist views of Islam. He regularly posted controversial videos filmed in his home, justifying IS beheadings and terror attacks such as the public killing of UK soldier Lee Rigby in 2013.Here is Anthony Small s most recent video where he targets Britain First co-founder Paul Golding former EDL leader Tommy Robinson along with conservative radio host Katie Hopkins. Keep in mind that Youtube is cracking down on conservatives for  hate speech  while this Muslim man is using Youtube to threaten the lives of 3 popular British activist. Censorship for conservatives is apparently more dangerous than death threats from professional boxers turned Muslim extremists:Haqq s views have led to multiple police raids on his house, as well as accusations of trying to join IS in the Middle East. VICE News spoke to Haqq on the run up to his arrest about police raids, Western foreign policy, and his faith. We then caught up with him again outside London s Old Bailey court after his release.Here s who  Anthony Small Boxer  really is.

        "text": "Donald Trump has finally pushed the intelligence community too far, and they will make him pay the price for it.Tensions between Trump and our intelligence officials has been clear since before the election in November. But the tension reached a whole new level after the election as Trump has repeatedly attacked the intelligence community for revealing his connections with Russia and confirming that Russia helped him win.Now the intelligence community is declaring war on Trump after he attacked them in the midst of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigning in disgrace for lying about negotiations he conducted with Russian officials prior to President Obama leaving office.Trump blamed intelligence officials for Flynn s resignation, suggesting that Trump would have kept Flynn on staff had the public not been informed of Flynn s activities and treachery via leaks.The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?  Donald J.

        "text": "21st Century Wire says As it turns out, we were right about the ambush, and we were right about the cover-up. After all this, the quislings at the The Oregonian are still trying to tart-up this FBI and OSP debacle by calling it a  traffic stop . While forced to now admit that there was foul play on the infallible government s part, mainstream media gatekeepers are still trying to paint the incident as a  traffic stop    which is beyond a joke.Get ready for another government-issued  magic bullet  fairy tale to protect the hired guns.How long before we can call this an assassination? New findings by law enforcement officials suggest that an FBI agent on the scene of the fatal shooting of Bundy-affiliated protester LaVoy Finicum during a Jun. 26 felony stop might have fired two shots that were not reported, and agents on the scene might have disposed of bullet casings to cover them up.According to The Oregonian, investigators believe that the shots were fired approximately at the moment at which LaVoy Finicum was exiting his truck with his hands up, prior to when he appears to reach into his jacket and is shot by two Oregon State Police troopers. The above-embedded slow-motion video shows the moment at which investigators believe the shots were fired.Deschutes County Sheriff Shane Nelson and Malheur County District Attorney Dan Norri, who investigated the incident, concluded that the Oregon State Police officers were justified in shooting Finicum, but also announced that they believe that an FBI agent took two unreported shots and then lied about it. The U.S. Department of Justice has subsequently launched a criminal investigation into the conduct of the FBI agents on the scene.The Oregonian s Les Zaitz wrote,  A state trooper later described to investigators seeing two rifle casings in the area where the [FBI] agents were posted. Detectives tasked with collecting evidence didn t find the casings, police reports indicate. He added,  FBI aerial surveillance video shows that before the detectives could get there, the FBI agents searched the area with flashlights and then huddled, according to law enforcement sources who have seen the video. The group then broke and one agent appeared to bend over twice and pick up something near where the two shots likely were taken. Police reports indicate that detectives showed up to collect evidence around 90 minutes after the moment in the surveillance video in which the FBI agent appeared to pick items up from the ground.All of the FBI agents on the scene that day claimed that they did not take any shots. A state trooper said he had fired three shots while the truck was speeding towards police and two more at Finicum as he was reaching into his jacket after he had exited the vehicle. Police inventory records show that the trooper was missing five rounds after the incident, apparently confirming his story.A fourth bullet hole in the truck came from a different angle of trajectory suggesting that an FBI agent had fired the shot. Investigators believe a second shot, which missed Finicum and did not strike the truck, was also fired by an FBI agent Continue this story at Truth In MediaREAD MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS: 21st Century Wire Oregon Files",

        "text": "The situation that 17-year old Ahmed Khalifa saw was disgusting. He was on board a Brooklyn subway train, listening to his headphones like many teens do, when he looked up and saw a man deck a woman who s an Orthodox Jew. She was just reading a book on the train, and he went up and slapped her so hard that he shattered her glasses and knocked her unconscious. Khalifa says he could almost feel it: It was a very hard slap, I almost could feel the slap. He was 6-foot-6, and a very big, big guy. He could have decided not to get involved. After all, he s Muslim and she s Jewish, and we all know Muslims are evil jihadists who especially hate Jewish people. He s a teenaged boy and the woman s attacker was huge. He could have stuck his head back in his headphones and minded his own business except he decided that catching the guy was his business. So, as Rayvon Jones ran, Khalifa held the train s doors open and yelled to the conductor to stay at the station and call for help.And then he took off after Jones, while also calling the cops. Khalifa later said, on camera: I felt bad for her because she was innocent, like innocent, she did nothing wrong. He did lose Jones briefly, but another Orthodox Jew asked him what happened, and then offered to help Khalifa find Jones. When they found Jones at a bus stop, they called what s known as the Shomrim, or the Jewish safety patrol. Jones climbed on a bus and pulled his hoodie over his head, prompting Khalifa to shout: Get out you coward! Why are you trying to hide! When the police got there and pulled Jones off the bus, he got aggressive and kept screaming he was going to kill everyone. He was taken into custody and charged with assault, and one of the Shomrim drivers took Khalifa home. The woman was taken to the hospital in stable condition.Khalifa sees everyone as people. People asked him why he would help a Jewish woman when he s Muslim, and it s his nature to treat everyone the same way. Obviously, when someone needs help, he helps, regardless of who it is.  Us vs. them  doesn t seem to have touched him the way it s touched so many others. People, especially fearful, bigoted conservatives, could learn a lesson or two from this teenager.Khalifa, while he doesn t see himself as a hero, is a hero.

        "text": "This presidential election has been bringing everyone out of the woodwork to reveal their opinions on who is running. Especially in regards to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.One person who seems to be abundantly clear about his opinion on Trump is former Tonight Show host Jay Leno. Sitting down with The Hollywood Reporter, Leno revealed, in so many words, that Trump needs to have some sense knocked into him, and maybe, just maybe, he d be a better person for it.Leno told The Hollywood Reporter: I think this is the problem with Donald Trump. I don t think anybody has just ever beaten the crap out of him, so he has this attitude of  whatever.  When you have the crap beat out of you, you learn how to negotiate, you learn how to deal with people. You learn that kindness is the greatest virtue you can have.I know people that say  Shut the f ing door  and I know people who say  Is it cold in here?  If you say  Is it cold in here?  someone will shut the door for you, and you haven t annoyed anybody or pissed anybody off. And that s my attitude about life, just trying to be kind.When you are poor it s easy to be kind. When you are rich and famous, it s not that it s hard to be kind, but it s harder because people suddenly start catering to your eccentricities or whatever it might be. And that s just the thing, Trump seems to have never been in a situation in his life where he s been forced to be kind. He s so used to everyone bending over backwards to please him, that he doesn t seem to think that he actually should be kind to others in return. This would definitely explain his bully behavior, and how he feels so entitled to pretty much everything, including the White House.Note: This article in no way is suggesting that Trump should be harmed. It is just revealing what Jay Leno said in an interview.Featured image via Kevin Winter/Getty Images",

CNN s Jim Acosta reported this horrifying new addition to the Trump administration on Twitter:Seriously, the last thing this country needs is more people tweeting and posting from Trump s accounts; most of us have already had more than we can stand. While Dan Scavino has been almost singlehandedly managing Trump s tweets as the narcissistic POTUS comes up with them, having staffers to help him out will certainly allow him to cover more ground. Acosta reported even more staffing decisions up ahead: The White House is expected to make more high-profile hiring decisions soon as a search is under way for a new communications director. White House press secretary Sean Spicer is currently handling both jobs, roles that are typically carried out by two staffers. While more visibility and transparency isn t a bad thing under normal circumstances, most of us know that this is a horrible idea for Trump s administration. Trump has already been extremely reckless in his social media use   just take a look below at some of Trump s security gaffes from this weekend alone:Clearly, giving Trump more exposure is far from a good thing as he s sure to turn the highest office in the country into a circus.

        "text": "Jedediah Bila is at most, a lukewarm conservative. She s a hardcore Trump hater, so the show gave her a little leeway when it came to expressing her lukewarm conservative views. Apparently, no one gave her permission, however, to ask Hillary Clinton to accept some responsibility for her loss during a taped segment last week.When Hillary agreed to appear on The View to hawk her new book,  What Happened  that explains why everyone else is to blame after was clobbered in the 2016 presidential election by Donald J. Trump, she certainly didn t expect to be challenged by the token conservative, who clearly hates President Trump. In other words, Hillary and likely the entire panel of dingbats on The View believed she was entering a  safe space , but that didn t turn out to be the case, as Bila zinged her with an unexpected question, that forced Hillary to scramble for an acceptable answer to her question. Of course, Hillary s answer had nothing whatsoever to do with the question Bila asked her, as Hillary hilariously attempted to blame the media for her loss. The 5:30 point is where Bila crosses Hillary Not surprisingly only one week after Bila s question of Hillary, the token conservative host finds herself in the unemployment line, while Meghan McCain, the daughter of one of the worst RINO s in the Senate will be taking Bila s spot, as the lukewarm conservative on the panel of hosts with the dingbats of The View.Meghan McCain told liberal rag PEOPLE magazine that she shed tears when Donald Trump officially won the GOP nomination for president at the Republican convention.For anyone who thinks Bila expected to be exiting The View, a quick look at a couple of her most recent posts on Facebook show that she was gearing up for the next season with the dingbats at The View:Only 5 days ago, Bila posted about hoping that Hillary would come back to discuss the issues with her:Most of her questions were softball questions and she spent a great deal of time trashing our president, but something happened lately, as Jedediah seemed to be actually defending her conservative principles. She recently challenged the racist, Trump-hating CA Congresswoman, Maxine Waters and her over-the-top rhetoric about our sitting President. The hyena s on the panel and the clapping seals in the audience would have nothing to do with an opinion that is contrary to anything other than the hard left. Why Bila put up with those dingbats for so many seasons is a mystery to many who watched. Apparently hating Donald Trump is enough to land a semi-talented female a coveted seat at The View s leftist propaganda table.Watch:Maybe it was just the Clinton interview that ended her career, or maybe it was a combination of the Waters and then Clinton interviews, either way, The View can sit back and rest easy, as Meghan McCain doesn t have a conservative bone in her body, and the  Goebbels Sisters  can now carry on, uninterrupted with their disinformation campaign about President Trump and about the American people who support him.",

He was sitting next to Trump the entire time with cameras capturing his soul slowly dying.At one point he had to sit quietly as the President of the United States claimed no president in history had accomplished more than he had so far in his presidency (although he made an exception for FDR). The lie was so incredibly easy to debunk that it s hard to imagine the White House will even try to defend it.

In the corner, making his best attempt to pull a James Comey and physically disappear into the curtains is National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster.Trump had each cabinet member take a turn praising him while he smiled.Later, Trump s Chief of Staff Reince Priebus openly groveled, praising Trump for  blessing  him with the opportunity to work in his administration.Priebus just thanked Trump for the \"blessing\" of being able to work for him.  Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) June 12, 2017Priebus s groveling may been necessary to keep his job.

The Disney owned ESPN sports network has been working very hard to change that.Fear and intimidation are two of the tools the Left uses in order to make people comply with their message of unity through division. And according to one TV and radio sports host, these tactics are beginning to take hold in the NFL.Fox Sports 1 host Jason Whitlock joined Tucker Carlson Monday evening on Fox News   Tucker Carlson Tonight  to talk about the state of protesting during the National Anthem in the NFL.Whitlock understands that protesting is perfectly within players  rights as Americans, but he takes issue with the method in which people like unemployed quarterback Colin Kaepernick go about protesting. There are NFL players, black and white, who know that if you really want to address police brutality, social justice, inequality in this country, protesting the National Anthem is the perfect way for your message to get completely lost,  Whitlock told Carlson.NFL players have so many platforms on which to voice their approval or displeasure on whatever issue they re championing this week. But to use the National Anthem as the vehicle for their message only causes their message fall flat in the eyes of a lot of football fans. These  silent protests  don t make them look heroic, but rather selfish.Whitlock also posed an interesting theory to Carlson concerning players who aren t participating in these social justice protests. I want to know why NFL players aren t offering voices of dissent?  Whitlock asked. You can t tell me that there aren t NFL players who recognize the stupidity of the style of protest Colin Kaepernick has chosen,  Whitlock said.  But they re all afraid to say it because of the backlash. Another good point.We have seen sports entities like the NFL and ESPN become bastions of social justice promotion in an age where people are being divided into more groups than the  Divergent  series.

MSNBC contributor Eddie Glaude asked Murphy what he believes the  animating commitment  behind the GOP health care bill is and what it would take for him to work in a bipartisan way with Republicans to fix the country s health care system. At this point, I think it s clear the animating commitment is a hatred of Barack Obama,  Murphy said.  The policy has been pushed to the wayside here. They don t seem tremendously interested in actually crafting something that insures more people or reduces rates. They just want to fulfill this commitment that they made to repeal Obamacare. Murphy went on to say that he has made it very clear he wants to compromise with Republicans on health care. They want, as far as I can tell, flexibility of benefit design. They want something that has some cheaper premiums, less regulations in these exchanges. I m willing to talk to them about that,  Murphy said.  I m willing to give them some flexibility of benefit design if they re willing to give us some security on these exchanges that Donald Trump won t unwind them. ",

        "text": "A Yelp customer service employee was fired just two hours after her open letter to Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman went viral.Talia Jane, a 25-year-old living in the San Francisco Bay area in California, worked as a customer service rep for Yelp s Eat24 food-ordering app. But after the company caught wind of a blog post she d written about how she and many other employees of Yelp struggled to make ends meet, she was fired. In her open letter entitled  An Open Letter To My CEO , she wrote: Every single one of my coworkers is struggling. They re taking side jobs, they re living at home. One of them started a GoFundMe because she couldn t pay her rent. Another guy who got hired, and ultimately let go, was undoubtedly homeless. Jane also spoke of how difficult it was to pay her rent when the company would only pay her $12.25 an hour, which translated to $8.15 after tax. Of her monthly expenses, Jane also had to spend over $200 to take public transportation to work, as her apartment was 30 miles away.Jane had tried to find ways to make it work. She explored living together with a co-worker, but soon found out that most of them lived with their parents or also could not afford the rent on their wages. Jane said, I thought to myself,  Oh, I m tremendously f*cked,  so I m just going to try really hard on improving at this job so I can transfer and get a pay increase, but then I was told that wouldn t happen for at least a year. To pay her rent and bills, Jane cut back on groceries and did 40 hours of overnight shifts every week   but she eventually reached her breaking point. She told Business Insider: I brought up the wages in every quarterly meeting I had with my managers. They were well aware that I was struggling despite doing what I could with what I had. The last straw was when I woke up yesterday two hours after going to sleep because my stomach hurt from hunger. And it s something I m used to, but this time it was really driving me to put something in my stomach immediately   I couldn t wait 15 minutes for my rice to cook and it all became very clear that this shouldn t be an issue I was dealing with to the point where I forgot it wasn t normal. It was then that Jane realized she couldn t continue on like this. She decided to start tweeting Yelp s CEO.TwitterTwitterTwitterJane followed those tweets with a blog post on Medium, where she spoke of  balancing all sorts of debt and trying to pave a life for myself that doesn t involve crying in the bathtub every week.  She wrote: I haven t bought groceries since I started this job. Not because I m lazy, but because I got this ten pound bag of rice before I moved here and my meals at home (including the one I m having as I write this) consist, by and large, of that. Because I can t afford to buy groceries. Bread is a luxury to me, even though you ve got a whole fridge full of it on the 8th floor. But we re not allowed to take any of that home because it s for at-work eating. Of which I do a lot. Because 80 percent of my income goes to paying my rent. Isn t that ironic? Your employee for your food delivery app that you spent $300 million to buy can t afford to buy food. That s gotta be a little ironic, right? MediumDriving her point home that her payment at Yelp was NOT a living wage, Jane went on to explain:I got paid yesterday ($733.24, bi-weekly) but I have to save as much of that as possible to pay my rent ($1,245) for my apartment that s 40 miles away from work because it was the cheapest place I could find that had access to the train, which costs me $5.65 one way to get to work. That s $11.30 a day, by the way. I make $8.15 an hour after taxes. I also have to pay my gas and electric bill. Last month it was $120. According to the infograph on PG&E s website, that cost was because I used my heater. I ve since stopped using my heater. Have you ever slept fully clothed under several blankets just so you don t get a cold and have to miss work? Have you ever drank a liter of water before going to bed so you could fall asleep without waking up a few hours later with stomach pains because the last time you ate was at work? That post went viral, viewed by over 85,000 people. In an interview with BuzzFeed, Jane said: I wanted [Stoppelman] to understand that I wasn t some little, annoying fly buzzing around his head. I wanted him to understand that I m not some obnoxious idiot who thinks it s funny to harass the CEO on Twitter. I m someone who has concerns and is reaching out, hoping that he can do something. I was sitting there and thinking,  I hope he sees this and I hope my CEO listens and hears me,  and then it started to dawn on me: I wonder if I ll get fired for saying this out loud? It only took two hours for her to find out. Soon, her company email account stopped working, and Jane was fired. She said, My manager and HR told me the letter and what I wrote violated Yelp s terms of conduct. A spokesperson for the company released the insensitive statement: We do not comment on personnel issues. However, we did agree with many of the points in Ms. Jane s post and we viewed it as her real, personal narrative about what it s like to live in the Bay Area. Most importantly, it s an important example of freedom of speech. We agree with her comments about the high costs of living in San Francisco, which is why we announced in December that we are expanding our Eat24 customer support team into our Phoenix office where will pay the same wage. However, Jane insists that Yelp isn t being honest about why she was fired. She said, Yelp is trying to make this die down by lying about it. Firing someone while their post about pay issues is on the cusp of going viral, that s like a lightning strike in the middle of a super dry forest. Things have just exploded. Jane is currently trying to find a new job, and will likely struggle financially until she can (hopefully) find something more promising than her former position at Yelp. If you are interested in helping Jane, she has left these details on another blog post detailing her termination from the company:Featured image via Talia Jane",

        "text": "Ohio Governor John Kasich has had a pretty difficult time getting his message out during the Republican race for the White House. Many of us assumed it was because he is being overshadowed by Trump and Cruz, but apparently this is a problem that he is facing in his own state as well   and it is quite embarrassing.Last week, the governor gave his annual State of the State Address and laid out his plans for the state. Instead of Republican lawmakers rallying behind their leader like you would expect them to   especially since he is running for president   they brushed him off just like voters have nationwide. According to The Columbus Dispatch: After he called on legislators during his State of the State address last week to revamp the way Ohio s congressional districts are drawn, his fellow Republicans who lead the General Assembly panned the proposal.Senate President Keith Faber   who represented the Kasich campaign this weekend in Michigan as GOP convention delegates were picked   said the legislature has higher priorities. .Even on modest Kasich proposals, such as altering state income-tax withholding tables that would get money to Ohioans faster but not provide an overall tax cut, the Republican leaders  biggest commitment was that they would consider his ideas.Ouch. That s rough. The Republican legislature apparently has no interest in listening to their leader. Kasich has spent his entire campaign telling the American people what an effective governor he has been, but if that were true wouldn t Ohio lawmakers be a little bit more enthusiastic about his proposals? Instead, they are like, Nah bro, we got this. Go away. Not only are lawmakers in Ohio wondering what the hell he was doing there, but Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are treating him the same way in the race for the White house. Both of his fellow candidates have been very vocal in the last week or so about their desire to see him drop out of the race, but Kasich said that isn t going to happen. Instead, the governor is continuing to sell himself as the  adult  who will be able to get the job done in the White House.I m not entirely sure how he expects to get anything done if he is president when he can t even get the Republicans in his own state to work with him. If his own party in his own state treats him like an annoying gnat, imagine how ineffective he d be in the Oval Office. This is just further proof that all of the GOP candidates would be horrible for the country and we need to vote blue in November. Featured image via Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images",

        "text": "21st Century Wire says A request by Native American tribes seeking to halt the construction of the final link in the highly politicized and controversial Dakota Access Pipeline has been declined by a federal judge in Washington DC.The tribes at Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux were not successful in claiming that the project will prevent them from conducting religious ceremonies at Oahe Lake but District Court Judge James Boasberg declined their request citing no imminent harm to the tribes  practices could be shown.As noted by RT and AP below, the project is headed up by Energy Transfer Partners, who s representatives argued that this halt in construction request over the issue of preventing tribes  religious ceremonies was  exceedingly tardy  and  not construction related.  The denial of this request is not coming as a surprise to many who are well aware that the DAPL project was more than 90% complete back when Obama signed a temporary hold on the project, which could have been largely a political move, leaving this issue for the Trump administration to handle. RTA federal judge in Washington, DC has dismissed a request by a group of Native American tribes seeking to stop construction of the final link of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes claimed the project will prevent them from practicing religious ceremonies at Oahe Lake which they say is surrounded by sacred ground. District Court Judge James Boasberg stated there was no imminent harm to the tribes  religious practices as oil is not flowing through the pipeline yet.The ruling will allow Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the $3.8 billion, 1,170 mile pipeline, to finish the final 1,100ft (335m) connection under Lake Oahe in North Dakota, completing the project.The company s stock rose 0.3 percent after the announcement, according to Seeking Alpha.Boasberg will more thoroughly consider the request at a February 27 hearing, AP reported.The US Army Corp of Engineers filed documents favoring Energy Transfer Partners, having granted the final easement for DAPL last Tuesday. The Corps said that the tribes will have plenty of time to argue their case before the pipeline begins working, thus a work stoppage wasn t warranted.Energy Transfer Partners had argued that the tribes  argument that the work threatened their religion was  exceedingly tardy  and  not construction-related,  AP reported.The decision allows construction on DAPL to continue while the lawsuits against the project to proceed.Boasberg previously rejected a request by tribes to block the project in September. However, that ruling was superseded by the Obama administration s decision in December to delay construction, pending an environmental review.However, one of President Donald Trump s first acts in office was to sign a presidential memoranda ordering the removal of obstacles to the construction of both the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Keystone XL Continue this report at RTREAD MORE DAPL NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire DAPL FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",

        "title": " Louisiana\u2019s Dem. Governor Steps Up, Signs Executive Action Barring LGBT Discrimination",
        "text": "Could anyone, in a million years, ever see Bobby Jindal doing the right thing and barring discrimination against LGBT citizens? That would be a no, because the rabidly anti-gay governor would rather pander to the religious right.But thankfully, Louisiana s new governor, a Democrat, has morals. And those morals include protecting all citizens from hurtful discrimination.John Bel Edwards, who was elected last November against serial adulterer David Vitter, signed a non-discrimination executive order which overrode an executive order put into place by Jindal that expanded provisions in a bill that allowed for a more rigorous approach to  religious freedom.  Edwards slammed Jindal as pandering to  a narrow political agenda. Although the anti-discrimination executive order doesn t pertain to private businesses, it does ban discrimination against state employees and workers hired by state contractors.The action, however, does allow exemptions for certain religious organizations and churches. Edwards addressed this concern, saying in a statement:While this executive order respects the religious beliefs of our people, it also signals to the rest of the country that discrimination is not a Louisiana value, but rather, that Louisiana is a state that is respective and inclusive of everyone around us.Contrast John Bel Edwards to Governors Pat McCrory and Phil Bryant. If this isn t enough evidence as to why it s so important for Democrats to get out and vote, I don t know what would be. As LGBT citizens across the South (and elsewhere) face intense attacks on their identity, Louisiana s Democratic governor stepped up and did the right thing.  In  heavily conservative and unpredictable state, Edwards risks not just his own career, but those who support his actions risk theirs as well.That s real leadership. Like Jindal s pandering, Bryant and McCrory serve only to do just that   pander. In their conservative states, they are safeguarded by the religious right and the Tea Party activists who cheer on discriminatory legislation.If the deeply religious, Catholic John Bel Edwards can see past religious pandering to do the right thing, so can any other politician.Featured image via screen shot from Campaign Ad",

        "title": "SPECTACULAR! Kid Rock Blows Up \u201cMade In China\u201d Grills In New Marketing Campaign For \u201cAmerican Badass Grill\u201d [VIDEO]",
        "text": "Michigan born and raised rock phenom Kid Rock is a big fan of President Trump and he s not afraid to admit it. I m proud to say Robert Ritchie, aka Kid Rock was born and raised in Romeo, MI, the same rural hometown where I grew up. Hunting was a common sport for kids who attended our high school, and many of the parents were employed by Chrysler, Ford or GM. Given his strong rural American roots, it s no surprise that he s such a big supporter of  made in America  products.  Kid Rock has been putting his money where his mouth is for quite some time with his wildly popular line of Made in Detroit products. He recently caused quite a stir with his line of t-shirts that are being sold that proudly show his support for President Trump.Kid Rock has announced his latest venture, the American Badass grill. Much like Trump, the outspoken rocker is taking it to China in his most recent videos, that show both his love for guns and his love for American made products.Here s his hilarious American-made  American Badass Grill  ad that showcases both Ritchie s love for guns and his dislike for products made in China. We got grills that are made in China, and we got .50 cals that are made in America. This is 100 percent pure American badass.  The goal was to show  what it looks like when Chinese-made grills meet American-made explosives. :Here s the ad Kid Rock uses on his website to describe why he s making  Made in America  grills. Go HERE to purchase the versatile $100 grill:In this ad, Ritchie and friends can be seen using a special technique to destroy BBQ grills that are made in China.  If it s not made in America like the Kid Rock American Badass Grill, you don t want it. : It really would be dumb to buy any grill other than the American Badass, which aims to  Make Grilling Great Again. When you get something made in America, the quality is going to be better,  Kid Rock explains.  Win, win, win, win, all the way around. It is one of the most versatile grills on the market. It is  large enough to fit 12 burgers, small enough to take the party on the road,  and also features a dual damper system that allows it to cook in different ways. The American Badass Grill comes with a dual damper system so you can control heat, the key to perfect grilling,  the website says.  Open the vents, let in more air and you ll turn up the heat for fast grilling with a nice sear. Close the vents to lower heat for low and slow grilling. The grills cost about $100. To paraphrase another American hero, go buy Kid Rock s stuff.  WFB",

The so-called chatbot TayTweets was launched by the Seattle-based software company on Wednesday as an experiment in artificial intelligence, or AI, and conversational understanding. But the company was forced to quickly pause the account and delete the vast majority of its tweets after the chatbot posted a number of offensive comments, including several that were admiring of Adolf Hitler.Along with  Hitler was right I hate the jews,  among other offending tweets, according to the International Business Times, were  Bush did 9/11 and Hitler would have done a better job than the monkey we have now. Donald Trump is the only hope we ve got. Asked if the Holocaust happened, the chatbot replied:  It was made up,  followed by an emoji of clapping hands.

        "text": "Obama s narcacism was in full swing on Saturday night at the 46th Annual Legislative Conference Phoenix Awards Dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus. He spoke for almost a half an hour about how good he has been for the country, and then he manages to tell the room that they need to vote for Hillary to keep from insulting his legacy! Oh, how the mighty have fallen. My name may not be on the ballot but our progress is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that s on the ballot right now. And there is one candidate who will advance those things. And there is another candidate whose defining principle, the central theme of hos candidacy is opposition to all that we have done. There s no such thing as a vote that doesn t matter. It all matters, and after we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the African-American community, I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election.

        "text": "It s clear Ted Cruz isn t even trying anymore. The Republican presidential candidate wasn t even able to use his own verbiage when defending his wife from an attack by Donald Trump.On Tuesday, Trump tweeted out, then deleted, then tweeted out again a bizarre threat aimed at Ted Cruz s wife Heidi.Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2016Then, in what could have just ended the weird battle between the two GOP frontrunners, Cruz tweets back:Pic of your wife not from us. Donald, if you try to attack Heidi, you're more of a coward than I thought. #classless https://t.co/0QpKSnjgnE  Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) March 23, 2016End of story, right? Just leave it there, right?While appearing on CNN, Cruz was asked about this little Twitter run-in with Trump regarding their wives, and the bizarre threat Trump placed on Heidi. Cruz, apparently unable to think on his feet or come up with a response on his own and clearly thinking no one would notice, decided to literally use a line from the legendary movie  American President. There s a scene in the movie when fictional president Andrew Shepard played by Michael Douglas, says: You want a character debate, Bob? You better stick with me,  cause Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your league. And what does Cruz say regarding Trump? And if Donald wants to get in a character fight, he s better off sticking with me, because Heidi is way out of his league.

Or did you think you were funny? Or did you think the moment to be funny would be in the defense of your wife from a misogynistic monster?Even the defense of his own wife is disingenuous.Featured image via video screen capture",

        "text": "The military s budget is being massively expanded this year, and nobody is really sure why. The answer seems to be  because we can.  Republicans in the Senate have decided that the Pentagon should receive even more money than Trump s hawkish White House wanted, and is giving the military things it never requested and does not need. The 2018 National Defense Authorization Act approves a budget of $696 billion, an annual increase of $80 billion. Meanwhile, Republicans are out to gut aid programs for low-income Americans.So why aren t  deficit hawks  like Paul Ryan questioning where this money will come from? We re ballooning the deficit to kill people, and for what, exactly? The Pentagon does not need the money. For example, the budget has allowed for 94 new F-35 Lightning fighter jets. Via Bloomberg:The measure would authorize 94 F-35 jets made by Lockheed Martin Corp., 24 more than requested by the president and seven more than the House agreed to in its version of the bill.Oh, by the way, the budget is also illegal. Why is that? Well, a law passed in 2011 only allows $549 billion in base-related expenses. The United States has 800 military bases and hundreds of thousands of soldiers occupying nations around the globe. The budget as it stands recommends $640 billion:Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) said during floor debate that his panel ignored the budget constraints set in law because responding to national security challenges requires more resources. The threats to our national security have not been more complex, severe, or daunting at any time in the past seven decades   and our job is to ensure we have a military capable of meeting those threats,  McCain said.  For too long, we have locked ourselves into making strategic decisions based on budget realities. It is time to start making budget decisions based on strategic realities. That s right. Republicans think we should make  budget decisions based on strategic realities,  completely ignoring military-related deficits, in order to pay for jets (and other stuff) the military never asked for and does not need.Or, maybe, the massive lobbying arm of the defense industry has more to do with it. They ve already spent tens of millions in 2017 alone to buy politicians and influence, and there s no slowing down.these two things are unrelated pic.twitter.com/3PGzZzrLj9  Adam H. Johnson (@adamjohnsonNYC) September 19, 2017What else could that money pay for? Great question. Common Dreams has a great perspective on the true cost of needless military spending:Put another way, with a $700 billion military budget, the U.S. would be spending more than three times as much as China on its military, and 10 times as much as Russia. According to [the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute], the U.S. already accounts for more than a third of all military spending.Yes, in the entire world. The United States, with about 1/25 of the world s population, is responsible for over 1/3 of the military spending worldwide. Who are we preparing to fight, exactly?Or with $80 billion a year, you could make public colleges and universities in the U.S. tuition-free. In fact, Sanders s proposal was only estimated to cost the federal government $47 billion per year.If the additional military spending over the next 10 years instead went to pay off student debt, it could come close to wiping it out entirely.Yet those kind of ideas, or universal healthcare coverage, are dismissed out-of-hand by Republicans. Maybe that s because the everyday people who would benefit most don t pay as well as insurance and military lobbyists. Maybe that s because most politicians, but especially Republicans, are more invested in personal careers and success than they are in their country.Eight members of the Senate voted against the bill: Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Bob Corker (R-TN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Mike Lee (R-UT), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",
